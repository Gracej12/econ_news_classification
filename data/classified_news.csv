To protect the environment

Reusing and recycling products would slow down the use of natural resources, reduce landscape and habitat disruption and help to limit biodiversity loss.



Another benefit from the circular economy is a reduction in total annual greenhouse gas emissions. According to the European Environment Agency, industrial processes and product use are responsible for 9.10% of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU, while the management of waste accounts for 3.32%.



Creating more efficient and sustainable products from the start would help to reduce energy and resource consumption, as it is estimated that more than 80% of a product's environmental impact is determined during the design phase.



A shift to more reliable products that can be reused, upgraded and repaired would reduce the amount of waste. Packaging is a growing issue and, on average, the average European generates nearly 180 kilos of packaging waste per year. The aim is to tackle excessive packaging and improve its design to promote reuse and recycling.



Reduce raw material dependence

The world's population is growing and with it the demand for raw materials. However, the supply of crucial raw materials is limited.



Finite supplies also means some EU countries are dependent on other countries for their raw materials. According to Eurostat, the EU imports about half of the raw materials it consumes.



The total value of trade (import plus exports) of raw materials between the EU and the rest of the world has almost tripled since 2002, with exports growing faster than imports. Regardless, the EU still imports more than it exports. In 2021, this resulted in a trade deficit of €35.5 billion.



Recycling raw materials mitigates the risks associated with supply, such as price volatility, availability and import dependency.



This especially applies to critical raw materials, needed for the production of technologies that are crucial for achieving climate goals, such as batteries and electric engines.



Create jobs and save consumers money



Moving towards a more circular economy could increase competitiveness, stimulate innovation, boost economic growth and create jobs (700,000 jobs in the EU alone by 2030).



Redesigning materials and products for circular use would also boost innovation across different sectors of the economy.



Consumers will be provided with more durable and innovative products that will increase the quality of life and save them money in the long term.","(4, 'national debt')"

Results from several nationwide surveys Bloom has been conducting during the COVID-related economic shutdown provide a snapshot of the emerging new reality.

Bloom, who is the William D. Eberle Professor of Economics in Stanford’s School of Humanities and Sciences and a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR), focuses on labor economics, management practices and uncertainty. Since the coronavirus crisis broke out, his 2014 study on working from home and ongoing research with other colleagues on business firms have been in high demand as policymakers and others scramble to better understand the shifting dynamics of the workforce and its economic implications.

Here, Bloom discusses the societal impacts of working from home and what his latest research reveals. And in a related SIEPR Policy Brief, he expands on his findings and offers policymakers and business leaders suggestions for making remote-work a permanent part of the labor landscape.

We live in an information economy and a gig economy. Now you’ve identified a new “working-from-home economy.” Why is that?

We see an incredible 42 percent of the U.S. labor force now working from home full-time. About another 33 percent are not working – a testament to the savage impact of the lockdown recession. And the remaining 26 percent – mostly essential service workers – are working on their business premises. So, by sheer numbers, the U.S. is a working-from-home economy. Almost twice as many employees are working from home as at work.

More strikingly, if we consider the contribution to U.S. gross domestic product based on their earnings, this enlarged group of work-from-home employees now accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.

How vital was the swift shift to working at home during the COVID crisis?

Without this historic switch to working from home, the lockdown could never have lasted. The economy would have collapsed, forcing us to return to work, reigniting infection rates. Working from home is not only economically essential, it is a critical weapon in our fight against COVID-19 – and future pandemics.

Why do you think working remotely is morphing into a more permanent reality?

The stigma associated with working from home prior to COVID-19 has disappeared. And working remotely is now extremely common, though under very challenging conditions, as I’ve written about earlier.

And a number of corporations are developing plans for more work-from-home options beyond the pandemic. A recent separate survey of firms from the Survey of Business Uncertainty that I run with the Atlanta Federal Reserve and the University of Chicago indicated that the share of working days spent at home is expected to increase fourfold from pre-COVID levels, from 5 percent to 20 percent.

Of the dozens of firms I have talked to, the typical plan is that employees will work from home one to three days a week, and come into the office the rest of the time.

What red flags are you seeing?

Not everyone can work from home. Only 51 percent of the survey respondents – mostly managers, professionals and financial workers who can carry out their jobs on computers – reported being able to work from home at an efficiency rate of 80 percent or more.

The remaining (nearly) half cannot work remotely. They work in retail, healthcare, transport and business services, and need to see customers or work with products or equipment.

Many Americans also lack the facilities or sufficient internet capacity to work effectively from home. More than half of those surveyed who are now working from home are doing so either in shared rooms or their bedrooms. And only 65 percent of Americans reported having fast enough internet capacity to support workable video calls. The remaining 35 percent have such poor internet at home – or no internet – that it prevents effective telecommuting.

What do all these negatives add up to?

Taken together, this is generating a time bomb for inequality. Our results show that more educated, higher-earning employees are far more likely to work from home – so they are continuing to get paid, develop their skills and advance their careers. At the same time, those unable to work from home – either because of the nature of their jobs, or because they lack suitable space or internet connections – are being left behind. They face bleak prospects if their skills and work experience erode during an extended shutdown and beyond.

What other impacts should we watch for in this transition to more remote work?

Growth of city centers are going to stall. During the pandemic, the overwhelming share of employees who shifted to telecommuting previously worked in offices in cities. I estimate that the loss of their physical presence slashed total daily spending at city center restaurants, bars and shops by more than half.

This upsurge in working from home is largely here to stay, and I see a longer-run decline in city centers. The largest U.S. cities have seen incredible growth since the 1980s as younger, educated Americans have flocked into revitalized downtowns. But it looks like that trend will reverse in 2020 – with a flight of economic activity out of city centers.

Where will the workforce go?

The upside is this will be a boom for suburbs and rural areas.

Given the need for social distancing, the firms I talk to are typically thinking about halving the density of offices, which would lead to an increase in the overall demand for office space. But instead of building more office skyscrapers – which has been the dominant theme over the past 40 years – I predict that COVID-19 will dramatically shift the trend to industrial parks with low-rise buildings.

High-rises in cities face two massive challenges post-COVID. First, mass-transit – the subway, trains and buses. How can you get several million workers in and out of major cities like New York, London or Tokyo every day with social distancing?

Second, elevators. Typically, before COVID, you could squeeze people into an elevator, with each person taking roughly four square feet of space. But if we enforce six feet of social distancing we need more like 100 square feet of space, cutting the capacity of elevators by over 90 percent, making it impossible for employees to reach their desks during rush hours.

What if social distancing is no longer needed?

Nobody knows for sure, but if a COVID-19 vaccine eventually comes out, my prediction is that society will have become accustomed to social distancing. And given other recent near-miss pandemics like SARS, Ebola, MERS and avian-flu, or the prior influenza pandemics of 1957-58 and 1968, firms and employees will fear the potential need to return to social distancing. So I anticipate many firms will be reluctant to rapidly return to dense offices.

My latest survey results seem to bear this out: employees reported a 25 percent drop in demand to work in high-rise offices in 2021, presumably after COVID.

If I were a company right now planning the future of my office, I would be looking to the suburbs.","(1, 'employment/wages')"

Background

Granville, NY and Poultney, VT are two neighboring communities and recipients of RERC planning assistance.

Recognizing that outdoor recreation is a large and growing sector of the economy nationwide, the Recreation Economy for Rural Communities (RERC) program was formed in 2019 to provide planning assistance to small towns and rural communities to help them boost their outdoor recreation economy and revitalize their main streets. The program is a partnership between EPA's Office of Community Revitalization, the USDA Forest Service, the Northern Border Regional Commission, and the Appalachian Regional Commission.

Some communities already have a robust outdoor recreation economy and are trying to develop their in-town amenities and create community consensus on the stewardship of natural resources and outdoor assets. Other communities are at the earlier stages of developing their recreation economies and are considering how they can harness its potential to revitalize their main streets, attract visitors and new residents, and ensure all residents are equitably involved in the planning efforts.

The RERC planning assistance process involves developing a local steering committee in each partner community and pairing them with a team of federal agency partners and consultants, who then work with the community over several months. The team supports the steering committee to identify the community's vision, goals, and actions they wish to take to boost outdoor recreation, revitalize their main streets, and promote equitable access to the outdoors for residents and visitors alike. The process involves several planning calls, a community workshop, and several follow-up implementation calls. Through the planning process, all partner communities develop a Community Action Plan, which identifies specific actions and next steps.

Applying for Assistance

The most recent call for applications for assistance closed in 2021. The call for applications is here for reference only.

We should pay closer attention to the interactions between politics, economics, and other realms

The COVID-19 pandemic strikingly illustrates the intersection of politics, economics, and other considerations. Public health experts have long warned that the world was likely to face a major pandemic and called for greater preparedness. Yet policymakers who have to focus on the next election find it difficult to invest the time, money, and political capital to address the abstract possibility of a future crisis. And so most of the world was unprepared for a global public health threat of the magnitude posed by the novel coronavirus.

As the pandemic has raced across the world, the policy response has continued to be tempered by political realities. Some members of the public, and some policymakers, have resisted the recommendations of public health experts, hoping for relaxed restrictions and a return to normalcy before the dangers have passed. At the same time, business interests have pressed for exceptions to benefit themselves, and for substantial subsidies—bailouts—to help them through difficult times.

At the international level, government responses to the pandemic illustrate the difficult politics of worldwide cooperation. A global pandemic requires a global response: microbes do not respect borders. A coordinated international response is clearly the best way to confront an international public health emergency. Yet policymakers under pressure from their constituents have diverted resources away from other countries, banned the export of food and drugs, and hoarded essential supplies. Each of these measures—popular as they may be to national publics—imposes costs on other countries. In the final analysis, the lack of cooperation makes everyone worse off. Such international institutions as the World Health Organization attempt to coordinate a cooperative global response to the global crisis—but they can be powerless in the face of potent nationalist political pressures (see, for example, Goodman and others 2010).

Every government faces tough decisions about the appropriate measures: what restrictions to impose and when to loosen them, where money will be spent and how it will be raised, and what national concerns can be limited to favor international cooperation. These decisions have to take into account public health recommendations, economic considerations, and political constraints. Just as the policy response to the 2007–08 financial crisis varied from country to country in line with local political economy conditions, so national policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic vary for health, economic, and political reasons.

Politics at play

This hotly contested policy response to a universal threat is no surprise to political economists. It happens all the time. For example, just about every economist believes that small countries would be better off if they removed all barriers to trade. Yet unilateral free trade is practically unheard of, and no country in the world today pursues it. Why not? More generally, why do governments have so much trouble getting economic policies right? Why does the advice of independent observers, analysts, and scholars go so often unheeded?

Politics is the usual answer, and the answer is usually right. But that is too vague—like saying that some countries are rich and others poor due to economics. Exactly how does politics keep governments from making better policy, even in the face of imminent crises? What does that tell us about how economic policy can and should be made?

Political economy is about how politics affects the economy and the economy affects politics (see box). Governments try to pump up the economy before elections, so that so-called political business cycles create ebbs and flows of economic activity around elections. By the same token, economic conditions have a powerful impact on elections. Political economists have uncovered the simple (perhaps disturbing) fact that the rates of economic growth and inflation are all the information we need to predict quite accurately the results of the past 100 years of US presidential elections (see, for example, Fair 2018). So why don’t elections work to push politicians to choose the best policies?

What Is Political Economy? Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and John Stuart Mill are widely regarded as the originators of modern economics. But they called themselves political economists, and Mill’s Principles of Political Economy was the fundamental text of the discipline from its publication in 1848 until the end of the century. These early theorists could not conceive of the economic and political worlds as separate. Two trends divided the political from the economic analysis. First, governments began to reduce their direct control over the economy. Second, different political forms emerged: Europe went from almost exclusively monarchical to increasingly representative, and highly varied, forms of government. By the early 20th century economics and political science were established as separate disciplines. For much of the 20th century this division reigned. With the Great Depression and problems of development, the purely economic issues were daunting enough to occupy economists. By the same token, the political problems of the era—two world wars, the rise of fascism and communism—were so serious as to require separate attention. By the 1970s, however, it was clear that the separation between the economic and political spheres was misleading. That decade saw the collapse of the Bretton Woods monetary order, two oil price shocks, and stagflation—all highlighting the fact that economic and political matters are intertwined. The economy was now high politics, and much of politics was about the economy. Over the past 50 years, political economy has become increasingly prominent in both economics and political science, in three ways: It analyzes how political forces affect the economy. Voters and interest groups have a powerful impact on virtually every possible economic policy. Political economists strive to identify the relevant groups and their interests, and how political institutions affect their impact on policy. It assesses how the economy affects politics. Macroeconomic trends can boost or ruin an incumbent’s chances. At the more microeconomic level, features of the economic organization or activities of particular firms or industries can have an impact on the nature and direction of their political activity. It uses the tools of economics to study politics. Politicians can be thought of as analogous to firms, with voters as consumers, or governments as monopoly providers of goods and services to constituent customers. Scholars model political-economic interactions in order to develop a more theoretically rigorous understanding of the underlying features driving politics. All three methods have profoundly affected both scholars and policymakers. And political economy has a lot to offer both to analysts of how societies work and to those who would like to change society.

Where you stand depends on where you sit

A basic economic principle is that any policy that is good for society as a whole can be made to be good for everyone in society, even if the policy creates winners and losers. It requires only that the winners be taxed just a bit to compensate the losers—and everyone is better off. Economists use powerful tools to clarify which economic policies are best for society. So why should economic policy be controversial?

A basic political economy principle is that the winners don’t like being taxed to compensate losers. And the battle is joined, not over what is best for society but rather over who will be the winners and losers. What is best for the country may not be best for my region, or group, or industry, or class—and so I will fight it.

Even in democracies, plenty of citizens might agree that politics obeys the golden rule: those with the gold make the rules. Special-interest groups do seem to play an outsize role around the world, democratic or not. These include wealthy individuals, powerful industries, big banks and corporations, and formidable labor unions.

How else to explain why Americans pay two or three times the world price for sugar? There are a handful of sugarcane plantations and a few thousand sugar beet farmers in the United States—and 330 million sugar consumers. You’d think that the 330 million would count for a lot more in politics than the several thousand, but you’d be wrong. For decades, subsidies and trade barriers have raised the price of sugar to the benefit of the sugar planters and farmers and to the detriment of everyone else.

Why does a tiny group of sugar producers matter more than the rest of the country? A commonplace of political economy is that concentrated interests usually win over diffuse interests. The sugar producers are well organized and work hard to influence politicians. If they didn’t get favorable government treatment they’d go out of business, so it’s important for them to organize to lobby and fund politicians. The cost to consumers is estimated at $2 billion to $3 billion a year. That’s a lot of money—but it comes to a couple of cents a day for the average American. No consumer is going to talk to an elected representative or threaten to vote for an opponent over a couple of cents a day.

The fact that producers are concentrated while consumers are diffuse helps explain trade protection. A few automobile manufacturers can organize themselves; tens of millions of car buyers can’t. That’s not all. Management and labor in the auto industry may not agree on much, but automakers and autoworkers agree that they want to be protected from foreign competition. Politicians—especially politicians from areas where automobile manufacturing is important—have a hard time denying a common demand of workers and owners in a powerful industry.

Perhaps this is not such a bad thing. Sugar farmers and autoworkers depend for their livelihood on supportive policies. Who is to say that their jobs are less important than lower prices for consumers? There is no simple, widely accepted way to balance the benefits against the costs—is cheaper sugar important enough to bankrupt thousands of hardworking farmers? Politics is, in fact, the way society adjudicates among conflicting interests, and maybe those with more at stake should have a bigger say.

Political economists don’t usually take stands on complicated moral and ethical issues of this sort. They try to understand why societies choose to do what they do. The fact that sugar or car producers have much more at stake and are much better organized than sugar or car consumers helps explain why government policies favor sugar and car producers over consumers.

Some consumers are concentrated, though. Sugar is sweet, and the corporations of the Sweetener Users Association want it to be cheap as well. Coca-Cola, Hershey, and the like have pushed hard to change American sugar policy. The fact that there are powerful concentrated interests on both sides of the issue helps explain why prices aren’t even higher than they are. The same thing is true of industrial products. Steelmakers want protection; steel users—like the auto manufacturers—don’t. Trade policy is not just a battle between big corporations and disunited households; it’s also a battle among big corporations. Otherwise we’d expect every industry to be protected and trade to be tightly limited everywhere.

In fact, there are plenty of powerful interests in favor of international trade and investment. The world’s multinational corporations and international banks depend on an open flow of goods and capital. This is especially the case today, when many of the world’s largest companies depend on complex global supply chains. A typical international corporation today produces parts and components in dozens of countries, assembles them in dozens more, and sells the final products everywhere. Trade barriers interfere with these supply chains, which is why most of the world’s biggest companies are also some of the biggest supporters of freer trade.

A complex web

Special interests as well as voters on different sides of every issue fight their battles in the political arena. But the rules of politics vary a lot from country to country. The way a political economy is organized affects who wins the battle over policy.

A logical starting point is elections, at least in democracies. Governments that don’t satisfy their constituents don’t remain governments very long. So we might expect democracies to choose policies that benefit the economy as a whole. However, the economy as a whole doesn’t vote.

Politicians need votes from the people who decide elections. The decisive or pivotal voters vary with a country’s electoral institutions and social divisions. In most political systems, the best targets are swing voters, who might change their vote in response to the policies of an incumbent or the promises of a challenger. If the poor vote for the left and the rich vote for the right, for example, the middle class could be decisive. In recent American presidential elections, the most important swing voters have been in distressed industrial regions of the Midwest. Many voters in these areas believe that foreign competition contributed to manufacturing decline. This helps explain why presidential candidates have become increasingly protectionist, even though most Americans support openness to trade.

In addition, policymakers in democratic societies must always pay attention to the next election—otherwise they are likely to cease being policymakers. This helps explain why it can be difficult for governments to pay money now for policies whose benefits will be realized only in the long run—such as pandemic prevention and preparedness.

The mass of special and general interests in society is overwhelming.Institutions help make sense of them. First are social institutions—the way people organize themselves. Some businesses, farmers, and workers are well organized, giving them more political clout. Farmers in rich countries are relatively few, are well organized, and are almost universally subsidized and protected. Farmers in poor countries are many, rarely organized, and almost universally taxed. Where workers are grouped into centralized labor federations, as in some northern European countries, they play a major role in national policymaking. The ways in which societies organize themselves—by economic sector, region, ethnicity—affect how they structure their politics.

Political institutions mediate the pressures constituents bring to bear on leaders. Even in authoritarian countries, rulers have to pay attention to at least some part of public opinion. Political economists call this the “selectorate,” that portion of the population that matters to policymakers. In an authoritarian regime, this could be an economic elite or the armed forces. In an electoral democracy it would be voters and interest groups. No matter who matters, policymakers need their support to stay in office.

In democracies, the variety of electoral institutions affects how policymakers feel constituent pressures. Organized political parties can help extend the time horizons of politicians: while an individual politician may worry only about the next election, a party has to be concerned about its longer-term reputation. On another dimension, where politicians are elected by the country as a whole, as in Israel or the Netherlands, the focus is on national policy. Where politicians represent narrower geographic locations, as in the US House of Representatives, the general view is that “all politics is local” (usually attributed to 1970s–80s Democratic Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill). These different electoral systems can drive politics toward more national or more local concerns.

Electoral institutions affect the identity of the people politicians need to attract to win an election. The US Electoral College makes middle-of-the-road voters in the Midwestern industrial states pivotal in presidential elections, driving the emphasis on protection for manufacturing. In a multiparty parliamentary system, the pivotal voters may be the supporters of a small party that can swing back and forth between coalition partners, such as the fringe parties for the formation of Israeli governments. Whichever voters the electoral system makes pivotal are likely to have outsize influence over politics and policy.

The character of legislative institutions also matters. For example, while a unitary parliamentary system can deliver big and fast change, in the US separation of powers system change is more modest and slower. Federal systems—in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, the United States—give provincial or state governments a lot of power, while centralized systems allow the national government to rule unchallenged. Some governments have handed off control of important policies to independent bodies that are less subject to day-to-day political pressures—such as central banks and public health agencies.

These institutions matter because they affect the weights that politicians give to different groups in society. Some sociopolitical institutions give labor unions a great deal of influence; others privilege farmers; still others are dominated by business associations. Political economists analyze the interests in play and how the institutions of society transmit and transform them into government policy.

Second-best can be best

All this matters to policymakers or observers or even just people who care about the economy because it can profoundly change the way we think about policy and policy advice.

The policy that economic analysis indicates is best for the economy may not be politically feasible. To go back to free trade, virtually all economists would recommend that a small country’s best bet is to remove all trade barriers unilaterally. Yet it is almost certain that a government that attempted to move to unilateral free trade would face massive opposition from special interests and from many in the public who would regard such a move as dangerous. The result might well be the collapse of the government and its replacement with one that could be relied on to maintain and even expand trade barriers. In this case, pursuit of the first-best policy could lead to a much worse outcome.

Politicians, analysts, observers, and just regular people who are interested in economic policy are well advised to evaluate not only the economic implications of policy initiatives but also their political feasibility. If the pursuit of a first-best policy is bound to fail and perhaps provoke a backlash, then truly the cure may be worse than the disease. It makes more sense to consider the political realities the government faces and to structure policy with those realities in mind. It is better to settle for second-best than to insist on first-best and end up worse—or, as folk wisdom has it, to let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

Bottom line

Political economy is the integration of political and economic factors in our analysis of modern society. Inasmuch as just about everyone would agree that politics and economics are intricately and irretrievably interwoven—politics affects the economy and the economy affects politics—this approach seems natural. It has proved itself powerful in understanding governments and societies; it can also be a powerful tool for those interested in changing governments and societies. Policymakers should hold these important lessons in mind today as they tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.","(4, 'national debt')"

Approximately 127 million people, or 40% of the U.S. population, live in coastal counties. In 2018, the American blue economy supported 2.3 million jobs, and contributed approximately $373 billion to the nation’s gross domestic product through activities such as tourism and recreation, shipping and transportation, commercial and recreational fishing, power generation, research, and related goods and services.

“By supporting the growth of the Blue Economy, we can help accelerate the nation’s economic recovery,” said retired Navy Rear Adm. Tim Gallaudet, Ph.D., assistant secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere and deputy NOAA administrator. “This plan shows how NOAA can further the benefits of the Blue Economy for all Americans.”

The Strategic Plan focuses on five sectors that NOAA will advance through agency-wide initiatives: marine transportation, ocean exploration, seafood competitiveness, tourism and recreation, and coastal resilience.

NOAA plans to further enhance these sectors by leveraging public-private partnerships, harnessing emerging technologies, and developing innovative STEM education and outreach efforts to train the next generation of Blue Economy leaders.

“By marshalling NOAA’s in-house expertise and collaborating with partners across the country, we can foster American business, entrepreneurship, and education in service of a sustainable Blue Economy,” said Nicole LeBoeuf, acting assistant administrator of NOAA’s National Ocean Service. “Our ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes resources are critical to our security and well-being, and I’m proud of NOAA’s commitment to understand and maximize the potential of these national assets.”

The 2021-2025 NOAA Blue Economy Strategic Plan aligns with several key agency initiatives, including implementing the National Ocean Policy of 2018, the 2018 National Strategic Plan for STEM Education, the 2019 Presidential Memorandum on Mapping the U.S. EEZ and Shoreline & Nearshore of Alaska, the 2020 National Strategy for Mapping, Exploring, & Characterizing the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone, the 2020 Executive Order on Promoting Seafood Competitiveness and Economic Growth, the 2020 Federal Strategy for Addressing the Global Challenge of Marine Litter, and several NOAA conservation, science and technology, and mapping strategies.","(0, 'GDP')"

Over 2021, real gross domestic product (GDP) grew faster than it had in any year since 1984. The U.S. economy is now 3 percent larger than it was just before the pandemic, the fastest pandemic growth in the G7. However, in recent decades, this aggregate growth across the U.S. economy has not always been reflected equally across the income spectrum, as those at the top have benefitted more than the rest. A key question, then, is whether this year’s strong economic growth has made its way to the typical American’s pocketbook.

New data from a team at the University of California, Berkeley—Thomas Blanchet, Emmanuel Saez, and Gabriel Zucman—suggest the answer is a resounding yes. The researchers disaggregate the growth in national income to show how it is distributed across groups of individuals. To do this, they start with total national income from the national accounts data—a concept akin to GDP that measures the sum total of all the income accruing to those in the United States[1]—and then show who that income goes to.

Their latest estimates show that the underlying economy is delivering gains to those in the bottom half of the income ladder, even before considering pandemic support. After adjusting for inflation, market income (labor and capital income before taxes and government benefits like Social Security, disability, and unemployment insurance) for adults increased across the income distribution in 2021. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2020, market incomes grew by 5.6 percent, on average. Growth was particularly strong in the bottom half of the income distribution, at 10.9 percent (Figure 1). This is consistent with published government data on employment growth, as 2021 saw the largest recorded one-year increase in jobs in U.S. history. Wage gains have been strongest for workers in the bottom quartile and fiscal support has benefited those in the bottom half of the income distribution, as described below.

These data are preliminary estimates using newly developed methods. Like much other economic data, they will be subject to revision as new information comes in. These data may also change as the methodology is refined over time. To present a complete picture of each income group’s total income flows, these estimates require inferences based on the limited available data on wages, capital income, and government transfers. Nevertheless, these methods have been developed over many years, and have been published and debated in top academic journals.[2] The development of these innovative methods has been a careful undertaking, constituting a significant step forward in disaggregating income growth across the distribution. Importantly, they help us determine how household balance sheets have weathered the challenges of the pandemic economy of the past two years.

Going back another year in the data helps economists understand how Americans across the income distribution were affected by the pandemic, and the extent to which they have recovered today. Predictably, the data show that looking over the past two calendar years, market incomes plummeted in the second quarter of 2020, reflecting unprecedented job loss and eroded financial assets (Figure 2). The damage was broad across all incomes but particularly severe for Americans in the bottom half. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, market incomes for adults in the bottom half of the income distribution were more than 25 percent lower in the second quarter of 2020. But, these data show that they have since rebounded: market incomes exceeded pre-pandemic levels for the bottom 50 percent, next 40 percent, and top 10 percent of the income distribution in the fourth quarter of 2021 after adjusting for inflation. On average, they were over 4 percent higher.

Market income is just one way to measure households’ abilities to pay for essential goods and services. Blanchet, Saez, and Zucman also estimate disposable income—income after taxes and government cash and near-cash transfers (Figure 3). For most Americans, disposable income was higher throughout the pandemic than it was in 2019, even as market incomes took a severe hit. Pandemic legislation, including the American Rescue Plan, in combination with preexisting policies, such as unemployment insurance or other income support, protected the bottom 50 percent and the next 40 percent from income losses relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, on average.

Zooming in on the bottom 50 percent illustrates this story clearly. The pandemic depressed market incomes, but public policies maintained disposable incomes throughout the pandemic while market incomes recovered (Figure 4). In the fourth quarter of 2021, market incomes for the bottom 50 percent were 2 percent higher on average than they were before the pandemic, and disposable incomes were 11 percent higher.

These data show that government support during the pandemic protected households, helping them manage the challenges of the pandemic, and positioning them today with higher levels of inflation-adjusted disposable income than before the pandemic. Other economic data also point to the benefits of the government’s response. As noted in a recent CEA blog, over 2021, the economy added 6.7 million jobs, and the unemployment rate fell to 4 percent—years earlier than projected just before the American Rescue Plan passed. As a result of pandemic support and these economic gains, child poverty is likely to be reduced by almost 40 percent in 2021. As the President called for in his address to Congress last year, this is an economy that is growing from the middle out.

The data also point to remaining challenges: while all income groups experienced income growth in the past year, these gains were not evenly shared. Over 2021, as the economy grew sharply, those between the 50th and 90th percentile saw their market income grow more slowly than those in the bottom half or the top 10 percent. And, across the income spectrum, many Americans are not necessarily feeling better off according to various surveys. Although all these income groups saw their inflation-adjusted market income grow, it may be that many are concerned that these gains will be erased by inflation or a turnaround in economic progress. Updates to these data and ongoing efforts at the Bureau of Economic Analysis to produce official distributional estimates will be important. As the Administration continues to use every tool at its disposal to build an economy from the middle out, long-term investments, such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, legislation to promote American competitiveness in manufacturing, and Build Back Better, can both increase economic growth and ensure that market incomes grow across the income spectrum.

[1] GDP measures the output of goods and services produced in the United States. National income, the measure used by Blanchet, Saez, and Zucman (2022), measures the “income from production that accrues to U.S. residents, regardless of where that productive activity is located” (BEA 2015). That is, national income is GDP minus capital depreciation, plus income from the rest of the world less income to the rest of the world.

Introduction

Last Updated Nov 1, 2020

As a result of months of tireless efforts and decisive action by people across our state, Maine has flattened the COVID-19 curve better than nearly every other state in the nation. In fact, Maine’s pandemic response, adjusted for population, includes some of the lowest numbers of hospitalizations, new case numbers, and deaths.

Our collective embrace of our new normal – safe and sensible ways of doing business, shopping, traveling and recreating to keep Maine healthy – has allowed Maine’s economy to reopen throughout the spring and summer months.

Starting on May 1, 2020, the Restarting Maine’s Economy plan established four gradual and flexible stages of reopening, which were designed in concert with public health experts and with input from industry representatives. This approach, which was adjusted when public health circumstances necessitated it, allowed Maine businesses to safely stay open or reopen by following reasonable, practical guidelines to ensure the safety of employees and customers.

The plan’s fourth and final planned stage begins Oct. 13, 2020, with timeframes identified for all Maine businesses to open and operate with appropriate safety modifications as outlined by the COVID-19 Prevention Checklists from the Maine Department of Economic and Community Development.

Public health remains the foremost factor guiding the Administration’s decision-making in its efforts against COVID-19. As the plan enters Stage 4, the Administration may consider and implement further protective protocols, along with broader additional health and safety measures, in order to safeguard the health of Maine people.

Guiding Principles

The guiding principles for this approach include:

Protecting Public Health: The State will continue to use epidemiological data, such as case trends and hospitalization rates, to inform decisions about the appropriate time to lift restrictions. Maintaining Health Care Readiness: Maine must be able to respond to any surge of COVID-19. To that end, the State will continue to work closely with hospitals and health systems to assess system capacity, including available hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators, and to procure and distribute personal protective equipment to hospitals, nursing facilities, emergency services, and other frontline responders. Building Reliable and Accessible Testing: Testing and disease surveillance, including contact tracing, are key foundations for opening the economy. While the widespread availability of rapid testing remains a challenge,the State is actively expanding testing to make it more accessible to Maine people. Prioritizing Public-Private Collaboration: Close collaboration among businesses, employees, government, and the public to develop, implement, oversee, and accept guidelines and safe practices is central to Maine’s continued success in controlling COVID-19.

Health Metrics

For the Restarting Maine’s Economy plan, Maine CDC epidemiological data, such as case trends and hospitalization rates, as well as health care readiness and capacity, informed decisions on proceeding through the stages.

The Maine CDC tracks three primary metrics to inform this evaluation:

a downward trajectory of influenza-like illnesses and COVID-like syndromic cases; a downward trajectory of documented cases and newly hospitalized patients; and the capacity of Maine’s hospital systems to treat all patients without crisis care and the ability of the state to engage in a robust testing program.

The Administration will continue to evaluate standards outlined in the Governor’s vision statement, such as testing capacity and contact tracing, to inform its response to the pandemic. If the COVID-19 situation worsens in Maine for any reason, the state will move quickly to re-institute safety protocols, or return to an earlier stage of the plan.

Maintaining Safety Precautions

In order to remain open, various sectors of Maine’s economy must implement practical, reasonable, evidence-informed safety protocols and modifications that protect the health and safety of employees and customers.

These accommodations are outlined in COVID-19 Prevention Checklists, which identify best practices for businesses specific to their operations, as well as general best practices related to physical distancing, hygiene, personal protection, and maintenance of clean workplaces, among others.

The checklists, which differ sector to sector, are the product of collaborative process between DECD and the private sector, which included rigorous review from government officials, health experts, and industry representatives. Health providers in Maine follow U.S. CDC and professional association guidelines.

These checklists will identify best practices for the business specific to its operations as well as general best practices related to physical distancing, hygiene, personal protection, and maintenance of clean workplaces, among others.

In order to promote checklist compliance and protect public health, consumers may make a report about businesses or organizations operating in violation of checklist requirements and endangering public health through this online portal.

The update measures the intensity of IP use and its persistent relationship to economic indicators such as employment, wages, and output. It also includes new demographic information about the employees working in IP-intensive industries. The updated data are more refined, thus improving precision in identifying companies within industries and adding new industries to the report.

The report’s major findings:

Industries in the United States that intensively use IP accounted for 41% of domestic economic activity, or output, in 2019. That year, the IP-intensive industries directly accounted for more than 47 million U.S. jobs. In addition to these jobs, IP-intensive industries supported an additional 15.5 million jobs in other industries that supply them intermediate goods and services. In total, the IP-intensive industries supported 62.5 million U.S. jobs in 2019, or 44% of employment.

Relative to workers in non-IP-intensive industries, workers in IP-intensive industries are more likely to:

Earn higher wages, with the highest earnings in the copyright-intensive industries, followed by earnings in the utility patent-intensive industries, design patent-intensive industries, and the trademark-intensive industries.

Work in larger companies (500 employees or more).

Participate in employer-sponsored health insurance.

Participate in employer-sponsored retirement plans.

Have a bachelor’s or graduate degree.

Cite this article Reuse our work freely

This article was published earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic, based on the latest published data at that time. We now source data on confirmed cases and deaths from the WHO. You can find the most up-to-date data for all countries in our Coronavirus Data Explorer .

Responses to the pandemic have often been framed in terms of striking a balance between protecting people’s health and protecting the economy. There is an assumption that countries face a trade-off between these two objectives. But is this assumption true?

A preliminary way of answering this question is to look at how the health and economic impacts of the pandemic compare in different countries so far. Have countries with lower death rates seen larger downturns?

Comparing the COVID-19 death rate with the latest GDP data, we in fact see the opposite: countries that have managed to protect their population’s health in the pandemic have generally also protected their economy too.

The scale of the economic downturn

This chart shows the scale of the recent economic decline across 38 countries for which the latest GDP data is available.1 It plots the percentage fall in GDP seen in the second quarter (April - June) of 2020 as compared to the same period last year, adjusted for inflation.

We see that in some countries the economic downturn has indeed been extremely severe: in Spain, the UK and Tunisia, the output of the economy in the second quarter was more than 20% smaller than in the same period last year. This is 4 to 5 times larger than any other quarterly fall on record for these countries.2 And in Peru the year on year fall was even larger, at 30%.

In other countries, however, the economic impact has been much more modest. In Taiwan, GDP in the second quarter of 2020 was less than 1% lower than in the same period in 2019. Finland, Lithuania and South Korea all saw falls in their GDP of around 5% or less.

No sign of a health-economy trade-off, quite the opposite

Have the countries experiencing the largest economic decline performed better in protecting the nation’s health, as we would expect if there was a trade-off?

The chart here shows the same GDP data along the horizontal axis. Along the vertical axis is the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths per million people.

Contrary to the idea of a trade-off, we see that countries which suffered the most severe economic downturns – like Peru, Spain and the UK – are generally among the countries with the highest COVID-19 death rate.

And the reverse is also true: countries where the economic impact has been modest – like Taiwan, South Korea, and Lithuania – have also managed to keep the death rate low.

Notice too that countries with similar falls in GDP have witnessed very different death rates. For instance, compare the US and Sweden with Denmark and Poland. All four countries saw economic contractions of around 8 to 9 percent, but the death rates are markedly different: the US and Sweden have recorded 5 to 10 times more deaths per million.

Clearly, many factors have affected the COVID-19 death rate and the shock to the economy beyond the policy decisions made by each government about how to control the spread of the virus. And the full impacts of the pandemic are yet to be seen.

But among countries with available GDP data, we do not see any evidence of a trade-off between protecting people’s health and protecting the economy. Rather the relationship we see between the health and economic impacts of the pandemic goes in the opposite direction. As well as saving lives, countries controlling the outbreak effectively may have adopted the best economic strategy too.

Prior to the pandemic, the region's gross domestic product (GDP) was expected to grow at a rate of 1.8 percent in 2020, a modest recovery from the 0.2 percent growth observed in 2019. Owing to the pandemic, however, the region’s economy will instead contract by an estimated 8.1 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund’s latest forecast. And while recovery is expected next year, its extent is likely to be limited, leaving economic output well below the pre-Covid level by the end of 2021. The potential for “scarring” and solvency concerns further weigh on the Latin American outlook, while upside potential exists from technological breakthroughs in treatments and vaccines, which would allow for stronger global growth and regional performance. Concerted government intervention will be required to assess the pandemic’s impact on poverty and inequality in the region.

The Global Outlook post Covid-19: Are We out of the Woods?

The Covid-driven economic crisis that began in the first quarter of this year was an unprecedented global shock to both aggregate demand and aggregate supply. As countries imposed strict social distancing measures to flatten the contagion curve of the pandemic, global production, consumption, and investment came to a virtual stop, first in China and then in the rest of the world. Firms that were able to operate remotely continued to function, albeit less than optimally, while those that depended on in-person interactions had no choice but to shut down. In the first half of the year, real GDP in China and in the biggest advanced economies fell by 30 to 40 percent on an annualized basis from one quarter to the next, the timing of these downturns following the spread of the pandemic.

The decline in activity was larger in labor-intensive service industries than in capital-intensive primary and manufacturing ones, causing unemployment to jump in most countries. The United States witnessed its unemployment rates jump from a record-low of 3.7 percent before the pandemic to a record-high (since 1947) of 14.8 percent in April of this year. In Europe, the increase in unemployment was lower due to its social safety nets, but real GDP plummeted nonetheless as work hours decreased. The pandemic’s effect on emerging markets was a mixed bag: some economies, like China, were able to control the spread of the virus early on, while others, like India, are still struggling with their health response. As a result, China saw its economy contract sharply in the first quarter and stabilize after that, in contrast to India and other less fortunate emerging markets, which are still facing harsher recessions.

Advanced economies are forecasted to contract by 6.1 percent in 2020, versus 1.1 percent in emerging markets and developing countries. However, excluding Asia, emerging market and developing economies are forecasted to contract more (4.0 percent), as emerging and developing Asia, including China, is the only region in the world forecasted to experience positive growth (1.0 percent) in the current year. Notwithstanding the pandemic’s unprecedented shock to the global economy, outcomes would have been considerably worse had it not been for the massive monetary and fiscal support measures countries around the world implemented in response. For instance, central banks cut interest rates and intervened directly in financial markets to prevent a disruption in liquidity and credit flows. This swift and massive policy support not only helped to stabilize asset prices but also was instrumental in ending a brief, but unprecedented, sudden stop of capital inflows to emerging markets. Fiscal policy complemented monetary efforts through a battery of measures designed to support individual incomes and businesses hit by social distancing, as well as to support the public health response. Fiscal relief came in the form of direct payments to households and firms, along with tax breaks, deferments, and guarantees; according to some estimates, this came at a cost of $8 trillion worldwide.

Despite having considerably less monetary and fiscal space than the advanced economies, emerging markets also reacted forcefully, as did international financial institutions—including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and many of the regional development banks—which acted promptly to support them.

Depending on the trajectory of the virus and the pace and distribution of technological advances, the biggest hit to the global economy may be behind us, with global recovery starting from the third quarter of this year and continuing into 2021. The IMF projects 5.2 percent real GDP growth in 2021 after a 4.4 percent contraction this year. Considering that, in 2019, global GDP was expected to grow by 3.4 percent in 2020 and 3.6 percent on average from 2021–2024, this would put post-pandemic levels 6 percent below the pre-pandemic trend by the end of 2021.

The output recovery underway in the United States has reduced unemployment from 14.8 percent in April to 7.9 percent in September. However, much of the recovery has been driven by consumer spending, which in turn was supported by income support under the CARES Act. Given the persistence and spread of the virus leading to continued and renewed restrictions, growth is once again at risk, especially if the next fiscal package is further delayed. For 2021, the IMF forecasts real GDP to grow by 3.1 percent in the United States, 5.2 percent in the Eurozone, and 8.2 percent in China (see Table 1). Numerous risks to these baseline projections exist, however, depending on both health and policy factors. Among the former is the likelihood of new waves of Covid-19 amid a lack of widely available effective treatments and delays in the availability and distribution of a vaccine. Among the latter, a premature withdrawal of policy support could derail recovery, while a deterioration in global financial conditions could trigger debt crises, especially in emerging and developing countries.

The Regional Outlook: How Will Latin America Fare?

It is no secret that economic growth in Latin America has underperformed for many years, when compared to other emerging market regions. From 1980 to 2020, the only period of significant expansion in real GDP per capita took place between 2003 and 2013 and was largely fueled by the China-led commodity boom rather than by improvements in physical and human capital investment or total factor productivity. Before the pandemic hit at the beginning of this year, the region’s GDP was already poised to grow at only 2 percent per year in 2020 and 2021. The IMF forecasts that real GDP for the region will contract by 8.1 percent in 2020 followed by a 3.6 percent expansion in 2021, leaving the region 8.7 percent below the projected pre-pandemic trend (or in per-capita terms, more than 10 percent below projections). Among the region’s six largest economies (hereinafter the Latam-6), those most severely hit by the pandemic were Peru, Argentina, and Mexico. These are forecasted to experience real GDP contractions of 13.9 percent, 11.8 percent, and 9.0 percent, respectively, followed by Colombia (8.2 percent), Chile (6.0 percent), and Brazil (5.8 percent).

Latin America’s expected economic performance in response to the pandemic compares unfavorably with that of other emerging market regions (see Table 2). Not only will this year’s economic contraction be deeper than in emerging regions of Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, but next year’s recovery will be relatively weak, further widening the income gaps across regions. Weak recovery—coming after years of low growth—has implications for poverty rates and living standards, which in turn are amplified by historically high levels of inequality in the region.

Latam-6 Country Outlooks1

Argentina

Argentina’s seasonally-adjusted quarterly real GDP fell by 50 percent in the second quarter, on an annualized basis. This dramatic drop of economic activity took place after a difficult 2019 in which GDP fell by 2.1 percent year-on-year and inflation reached 54 percent—up from 48 percent the year before. Against the backdrop of this health and economic crisis, 2020 saw Argentina complete its ninth sovereign debt restructuring with private creditors, and its government is now preparing to start negotiations with the IMF on a new IMF-supported program. The IMF predicts Argentina’s GDP will shrink by an additional 11.8 percent this year and expand by 4.9 percent in 2021 (see Table 3), hence accumulating a permanent loss of 8.0 percent; this adds to the malaise of the past seven years, during which the country’s real GDP did not grow at all. Going forward, Argentina’s growth prospects will be challenged by persistently high inflation, a high fiscal deficit (10 percent of GDP) significantly increased by the pandemic, and high exchange rate volatility due to a very low level of foreign reserves.

Brazil

Compared to the rest of the region, Brazil’s second quarter contraction (33.5 percent when seasonally adjusted and annualized) was relatively mild. Various factors contributed to this outcome, including looser quarantine measures than those implemented by neighbors such as Argentina and Peru, increased exports to China (particularly of soybeans), and a spectacular increase in fiscal transfers. This last measure raised the budget deficit by 10 percent of GDP—from around 6 percent in 2019 to an expected 16 percent in 2020. In addition, the Central Bank reduced the monetary policy interest rate to a record-low 2 percent, aided by low inflation. Brazil’s GDP is forecast to contract by 5.8 percent this year and expand by 2.8 percent next year, as fiscal stimulus unwinds to comply with the constitutional mandate of keeping primary spending constant in real terms over the medium term. It is also worth noting that, along with Mexico, Brazil is one of two countries in Latin America with access to a dollar swap line with the U.S. Federal Reserve.

Chile

Second quarter GDP contraction (seasonally adjusted and annualized) was 43 percent, higher than in Brazil but lower than in the other Latam-6 countries. An improvement in external terms of trade, due to sustained copper prices and low oil prices, prevented a stronger collapse in real income. Even so, Chile’s GDP is expected to fall by 6.0 percent this year, due to a decrease in export volumes and a strict lockdown—notwithstanding the strong expansionary fiscal and monetary policies adopted by its government and Central Bank. On the monetary side, the Central Bank kept the policy rate at 0.5 percent, but it introduced unconventional liquidity measures to prop up credit supply. On the fiscal side, Chile’s budget deficit rose to an expected 12 percent of GDP. This was complemented by a resolution authorizing younger workers to withdraw money from their individual pension accounts. The economy is expected to recover next year, growing by 4.5 percent, but an impending referendum on a new constitution clouds the long-term horizon. As of May 2020, Chile has a Flexible Credit Line (FCL) with the IMF providing access to roughly $24 billion to meet its balance of payments needs.

Colombia

The Andean country has been struggling to control the pandemic, intermittently shutting and re-opening its economy as the health system has become stressed in some major cities. A sharp decline in domestic demand, combined with the decrease in the price of oil and an overall reduction in exports, provoked a sharp increase in unemployment: it jumped from 10.5 percent in January to almost 20 percent in August, although it is expected to fall to 17.3 percent by the end of this year (see Table 4). Second-quarter contraction was in-line with the region, but third-quarter recovery was slow because of this unemployment increase. Colombia’s economy is posed to contract by 8.2 percent this year and grow by 4.0 percent next year. Weaker public finances (as compared with Chile and Peru) and a lack of monetary maneuvering space prevent the government from engineering a large stimulus program; furthermore, as in Brazil, Colombia’s public sector budget is subject to the strictures of a multi-year fiscal responsibility rule that calls for a fiscal contraction next year. Colombia has an expanded Flexible Credit Line with the IMF, which was further increased on September 25, 2020, providing total access to roughly $17.2 billion for balance of payments needs.

Mexico

Mexico’s economy was already in poor shape last year when a mild recession took place; it contracted again in the first quarter of this year. The pandemic accelerated the reduction in Mexico’s real GDP as lower demand from the United States restricted manufacturing production and exports. Despite having more fiscal space than Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia, the stimulus plan implemented by Mexico’s federal government was weak—and, for the most part, consisted of handouts to households rather than programs to protect employment in business activities, particularly in the large (both formal and informal) service sector and among small and medium enterprises. The IMF expects a sharp contraction in 2020 (by 9.0 percent) followed by a mild recovery in 2021 (by 3.5 percent). Like Brazil, Mexico has access to a dollar swap line with the U.S. Federal Reserve; it also has access to an FCL with the IMF, which provides an additional $61 billion.

Peru

The Peruvian economy contracted by a record 72 percent in the second quarter (annualized and seasonally adjusted). The strict nationwide lockdown needed to fight a stubbornly high Covid-19 infection rate caused domestic consumption and investment to plummet; at the same time, the drop in metal demand—especially from China—drove exports down, resulting in a projected 13.9 percent contraction this year, after a meager 2.2 percent growth rate in 2019. However, the government is using the fiscal space it enjoys thanks to prudent budgetary policies implemented in the past to stimulate domestic demand amid a sharp increase in unemployment. Along with the resumption of exports to China, this will make it possible for Peru to experience a recovery next year, when GDP is expected to grow by 7.3 percent. Peru also has an FCL with the IMF which was approved in May 2020 and which provides up to $11 billion in balance of payments financing.

Risks to Baseline Forecasts

The above forecasts correspond to a baseline scenario, but there are upside and downside risks affecting individual countries and the region as a whole. These risks stem mainly from changes in health conditions, global trade, and domestic policies.

On the health front, the baseline scenario assumes that the pandemic will be controlled by mid-2021—if perhaps not globally, at least in advanced countries. Vaccine availability and effective disease treatments will allow consumer and business confidence to return, causing global and individual economies to normalize. In the meantime, Covid-19 will continue to be a threat, especially in emerging and developing countries, particularly if new contagion waves occur calling for fresh new lockdowns. In this sense, the rapid deployment of a vaccine, targeting universal access, should increase the speed and strength of global economic recovery.

Regarding trade, the World Trade Organization forecasts that global trading volumes will decline by 9.2 percent in 2020, followed by a partial recovery in 2021. However, economic effects so far have differed widely across regions and by country. In Latin America, Brazil benefitted from higher exports to China, but Colombia and Peru did not. Mexico’s manufacturing exports suffered because they are linked to industrial production in the United States, and they are still depressed. Sustained copper prices helped Chile to keep export revenues high, but soybean exports in Argentina did not increase as they did in Brazil, because of export taxes and a less competitive exchange rate. Going forward, all countries in the region are likely to benefit from the renewed increase in world trade and the recovery of commodity prices. However, unlike during the Global Financial Crisis, China’s relatively more restrained policy response means that China is unlikely to be as significant a source of export demand as before, potentially weighing on the outlook for many Latin American economies.

Lastly, on the issue of domestic policy, there is a question of how much fiscal and monetary space the Latam-6 countries have—the unfortunate answer is not very much, and certainly less than advanced economies. Moreover, fiscal policy will need to weigh debt-sustainability as well as price-stability concerns. Unless modified, Brazil and Colombia will soon have to start unwinding the fiscal expansions introduced this year in order to comply with their own fiscal responsibility rules, while Argentina faces an even more complicated situation because the increase in its budget deficit was financed almost exclusively by issuing money. As the local economy reopens, Argentina will likely see inflation accelerate from its already high level. On the other hand, the need to reverse fiscal expansion is less urgent in Chile and Peru, thanks to the greater space afforded by past fiscal restraint in these countries, and in Mexico, because its initial fiscal expansion was not as large in response to the first wave of the pandemic.

On the positive side, global financial conditions remain supportive. Along with the fact that all Latam-6 countries (except Argentina) have low inflation, this gives their central banks room to keep interest rates low for longer—and, in certain circumstances, even to resort to unconventional monetary easing if needed without their jeopardizing currency and financial stability.

The Role of International Financial Institutions and Foreign Donors during the Pandemic

Given the unprecedented nature of the Covid-19 crisis, the force with which multilateral and bilateral organizations responded to it is not surprising. Efforts were made to mobilize resources in large quantities to support emerging and developing economies. Several Latin American countries requested and obtained emergency loans from the IMF, while others have been granted precautionary credit since March. Emergency loans from the IMF, in the shape of the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) and the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI), allow the IMF to “provide emergency assistance without the need to have a full-fledged program in place,” and are better suited to the needs of the smaller and poorer countries in the region. Ecuador received an RFI and an Extended Fund Facility (EFF), the latter in the amount of $6.5 billion. Honduras and Barbados augmented their existing EFF and Stand-By Arrangement (SBA).

In addition to lending money in concessional terms to these countries, the IMF can alleviate existing official debt service for low income countries that qualify through its Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT). The CCRT—which grew out of efforts to eliminate Haiti’s entire outstanding debt to the IMF after the 2010 earthquake—provides grants to the Fund’s poorest and most vulnerable members in order to cover IMF debt service obligations. A separate initiative, the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), was proposed by the heads of the IMF and the World Bank in March, and agreed to by G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in April. This measure will “allow official bilateral donors to suspend debt service payments from the poorest countries and, in this way, free up scarce resources that can be used to safeguard lives and livelihoods in those countries.” The Fund, the World Bank, and the G20 have also called for private sector creditors to participate in similar debt relief on comparable voluntary terms, which could add a further $7 billion of relief.

For the larger countries that are the focus of this report, emergency credit assistance has not been necessary during the pandemic, because all of them, with the exception of Argentina, have access to voluntary lending from domestic and external private sources. This access is available at relatively low interest rates thanks to supportive international and local capital market conditions. Rather than emergency measures, a number of these larger Latin American economies have accessed precautionary financial assistance from the IMF in the form of Flexible Credit Lines (FCLs). This form of assistance is available to countries with “very strong policy frameworks and track records” that don’t have a current balance of payments need but could have one in the future. Since the start of the crisis, the IMF has approved FCLs for Chile, Colombia, and Peru in the amounts of $23.9 billion, $16.9 billion, and $11 billion, respectively. Mexico also has an FCL, which was most recently re-approved in November 2019. While there is no official eligibility list for the FCL, Argentina is almost certainly ineligible; in addition, Argentina already owes $44 billion to the Fund. This money was disbursed before the pandemic as part of an SBA designed to cope with a currency crisis that afflicted the economy in 2018 and 2019. Even though Argentina cannot expect fresh resources from the Fund, conversations to extend the maturity of the country’s massive existing debt are scheduled to begin soon between the Argentine Government and the IMF.

Conclusion

The Covid-driven economic crisis that began in January of this year was an unprecedented global shock to both aggregate demand and aggregate supply. Outcomes would have been considerably worse had it not been for the equally unprecedented monetary and fiscal support measures countries put forth in response to the pandemic. While the largest policy packages have come from advanced economies, emerging markets also reacted forcefully despite having considerably less monetary and fiscal space, as did international financial institutions.

Leading economic indicators available in most countries suggest that the worse of the crisis may be behind us and that the world economy is set to recover beginning in the fourth quarter of this year. Unfortunately, Latin America’s economy took an especially hard hit from the pandemic when compared to the world or to other emerging markets. Not only will this year’s economic contraction be deeper in Latin America than in emerging regions of Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, but next year’s recovery will be relatively weak, further widening the income gaps across regions.

Among the Latin American region’s top six economies, those most severely hit by the pandemic are Peru, Argentina, and Mexico. Brazil, Chile, and Colombia are also forecast to incur economic contractions in excess of 5 percent this year. Recovery is expected to be slow in all of these countries except Peru, and even in the latter, it will not amount to a full-fledged V-shaped recovery. Risks to the baseline scenarios stem mainly from changes in health conditions, global trade, and domestic policies, as well as from the potential for solvency concerns to slow economic recovery. On the positive side, global financial conditions remain supportive. This, and the fact that all Latam-6 countries (except Argentina) have low inflation, provides sufficient room for central banks to keep interest rates low for longer, and even to try unconventional monetary easing in certain circumstances, without jeopardizing currency and financial stability.

11,Global Economy to Slow Further Amid Signs of Resilience and China Re-opening - International Monetary Fund,Global Economy to Slow Further Amid Signs of Resilience and China Re-opening  International Monetary Fund,"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltZi5vcmcvZW4vQmxvZ3MvQXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyMy8wMS8zMC9nbG9iYWwtZWNvbm9teS10by1zbG93LWZ1cnRoZXItYW1pZC1zaWducy1vZi1yZXNpbGllbmNlLWFuZC1jaGluYS1yZS1vcGVuaW5n0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,International Monetary Fund,"The global economy is poised to slow this year, before rebounding next year. Growth will remain weak by historical standards, as the fight against inflation and Russia’s war in Ukraine weigh on activity.

Despite these headwinds, the outlook is less gloomy than in our October forecast, and could represent a turning point, with growth bottoming out and inflation declining.

Economic growth proved surprisingly resilient in the third quarter of last year, with strong labor markets, robust household consumption and business investment, and better-than-expected adaptation to the energy crisis in Europe. Inflation, too, showed improvement, with overall measures now decreasing in most countries—even if core inflation, which excludes more volatile energy and food prices, has yet to peak in many countries.

Elsewhere, China’s sudden re-opening paves the way for a rapid rebound in activity. And global financial conditions have improved as inflation pressures started to abate. This, and a weakening of the US dollar from its November high, provided some modest relief to emerging and developing countries.

Accordingly, we have slightly increased our 2022 and 2023 growth forecasts. Global growth will slow from 3.4 percent in 2022 to 2.9 percent in 2023 then rebound to 3.1 percent in 2024.

For advanced economies, the slowdown will be more pronounced, with a decline from 2.7 percent last year to 1.2 percent and 1.4 percent this year and next. Nine out of 10 advanced economies will likely decelerate.

US growth will slow to 1.4 percent in 2023 as Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes work their way through the economy. Euro area conditions are more challenging despite signs of resilience to the energy crisis, a mild winter, and generous fiscal support. With the European Central Bank tightening monetary policy, and a negative terms-of-trade shock—due to the increase in the price of its imported energy—we expect growth to bottom out at 0.7 percent this year.

Emerging market and developing economies have already bottomed out as a group, with growth expected to rise modestly to 4 percent and 4.2 percent this year and next.

The restrictions and COVID-19 outbreaks in China dampened activity last year. With the economy now re-opened, we see growth rebounding to 5.2 percent this year as activity and mobility recover.

India remains a bright spot. Together with China, it will account for half of global growth this year, versus just a tenth for the US and euro area combined. Global inflation is expected to decline this year but even by 2024, projected average annual headline and core inflation will still be above pre-pandemic levels in more than 80 percent of countries.

The risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside, even if adverse risks have moderated since October and some positive factors gained in relevance.

On the downside:

China’s recovery could stall amid greater-than-expected economic disruptions from current or future waves of COVID-19 infections or a sharper-than-expected slowdown in the property sector





Inflation could remain stubbornly high amid continued labor-market tightness and growing wage pressures, requiring tighter monetary policies and a resulting sharper slowdown in activity





An escalation of the war in Ukraine remains a major threat to global stability that could destabilize energy or food markets and further fragment the global economy





A sudden repricing in financial markets, for instance in response to adverse inflation surprises, could tighten financial conditions, especially in emerging market and developing economies

On the upside:

Strong household balance sheets, together with tight labor markets and solid wage growth could help sustain private demand, although potentially complicating the fight against inflation





Easing supply-chain bottlenecks and labor markets cooling due to falling vacancies could allow for a softer landing, requiring less monetary tightening

Policy priorities

The inflation news is encouraging, but the battle is far from won. Monetary policy has started to bite, with a slowdown in new home construction in many countries. Yet, inflation-adjusted interest rates remain low or even negative in the euro area and other economies, and there is significant uncertainty about both the speed and effectiveness of monetary tightening in many countries.

Where inflation pressures remain too elevated, central banks need to raise real policy rates above the neutral rate and keep them there until underlying inflation is on a decisive declining path. Easing too early risks undoing all the gains achieved so far.

The financial environment remains fragile, especially as central banks embark on an uncharted path toward shrinking their balance sheets. It will be important to monitor the build-up of risks and address vulnerabilities, especially in the housing sector or in the less-regulated non-bank financial sector. Emerging market economies should let their currencies adjust as much as possible in response to the tighter global monetary conditions. Where appropriate, foreign exchange interventions or capital flow measures can help smooth volatility that’s excessive or not related to economic fundamentals.

Many countries responded to the cost-of-living crisis by supporting people and businesses with broad and untargeted policies that helped cushion the shock. Many of these measures have proved costly and increasingly unsustainable. Countries should instead adopt targeted measures that conserve fiscal space, allow high energy prices to reduce demand for energy, and avoid overly stimulating the economy.

Supply-side policies also have a role to play. They can help remove key growth constraints, improve resilience, ease price pressures, and foster the green transition. These would help alleviate the accumulated output losses since the beginning of the pandemic, especially in emerging and low-income economies.

Finally, the forces of geoeconomic fragmentation are growing. We must buttress multilateral cooperation, especially on fundamental areas of common interest such as international trade, expanding the global financial safety net, public health preparedness and the climate transition.

This time around, the global economic outlook hasn’t worsened. That’s good news, but not enough. The road back to a full recovery, with sustainable growth, stable prices, and progress for all, is only starting.","(3, 'inflation')"
12,Ten Charts That Explain the U.S. Economy in 2023 | CEA - The White House,Ten Charts That Explain the U.S. Economy in 2023 | CEA  The White House,"Tue, 19 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndoaXRlaG91c2UuZ292L2NlYS93cml0dGVuLW1hdGVyaWFscy8yMDIzLzEyLzE5L3Rlbi1jaGFydHMtdGhhdC1leHBsYWluLXRoZS11LXMtZWNvbm9teS1pbi0yMDIzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The White House,"The US Economy defied expectations in 2023. Many forecasters predicted a recession at the year’s outset, some even asserting it with a 100% probability. This blog post highlights ten trends that capture some of the most important economic developments of the past year. Taken together, they depict an economy characterized by robust growth driven by strong consumer spending backed by robust and steady job growth, growing real wages, and historic gains for women and Black workers. At the same time, the data show that the historic public investments that make up the Biden-Harris Administration’s economic agenda in critical sectors for future growth, resiliency, and security are beginning to come to fruition. Nevertheless, there is more work to do to lower costs for American families and ensure Americans feel the benefit of continued real wage growth, a strong labor market, and declining inflation.

Growth was stronger than expected a year ago.

Defying pessimistic forecasts, US economic growth has progressed at a significant pace over the course of 2023. Last December, the private consensus for real economic growth as measured by the Blue Chip Economic Forecast was negative 0.1% for the year. The latest Blue Chip projection for 2023 growth, incorporating all available data to date, is positive 2.6%, driven by strength in consumer spending, a revival in manufacturing structures investment and increased state and local government purchases. The level of US real GDP in 2023 even exceeded some pre-pandemic forecasts, including that of the Congressional Budget Office and the International Monetary Fund. Sound household balance sheets and a strong labor market are the primary drivers of US consumer expenditures, which continue to grow at a pace close to the average among prior expansions.

Manufacturing investment reached historic highs.

In 2023 Q3, real (inflation-adjusted) private manufacturing construction investment reached its highest level on record since 1958. Likewise, manufacturing construction contributed the most to year-on-year real GDP growth on record. A major factor in this historic manufacturing boom has been the Inflation Reduction Act.

Jobs growth cooled towards a steady & stable pace, while the unemployment rate stayed low despite falling inflation.

Job gains continued at a very strong pace in 2023, although down from the torrid rates seen in 2021 and 2022 immediately following the pandemic recession. Monthly nonfarm payrolls grew by 232,000 per month on average in 2023, 55,000 more jobs per month than the average pace in 2018 and 2019. As a result, total job gains achieved under the Biden administration reached 14.1 million through November 2023. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has, to date, stayed below 4% for 22 straight months, a run not seen in more than 50 years. This is especially remarkable given the fall in inflation.

Inflation decelerated throughout the year

After peaking in summer 2022, inflation has been on a downward trend for a year and a half thanks to a retreat of food, energy, and goods inflation. Inflation in the services sector—which heavily depends on wages as labor is the most important cost in the production of services— has decelerated more slowly and in lockstep with a gradual moderation of wage inflation. Meanwhile, market data on new leases suggest that housing price pressures should continue to ease.

…in large part thanks to healing supply chains.

As CEA has highlighted, the rise and subsequent fall of inflation during the pandemic was overwhelmingly linked to supply-side forces, including the unsnarling of global supply chains and the rise in prime-age labor force participation. Our analysis finds that the unsnarling of supply chains, either by themselves or in tandem with cooling demand, explain 80 percent of the disinflation that has occurred thus far. In fact, one of the most important economic developments of the year was the achievement of significantly lower inflation without a substantial rise in the unemployment rate.

Real wages grew and wage inequality fell.

Real wages began to grow in 2023 as inflation fell from its 2022 peak and workers received robust nominal wage gains. In the year ending in November, real wages grew by about 0.8 percent for all workers and 1.1 percent for the 80% of workers who are production and non-supervisory workers. Further, wage inequality fell. The ratio of wages at the 90th percentile compared to the 10th percentile fell by nearly 6 percent over the year. One reason to continue to be optimistic about this trend in 2024 is the historic union activity and wins in 2023. Strong unions help grow the economy by reducing inequality and raising incomes.

Women and Black Americans made historic gains in the labor market.

The year 2023 saw the highest rate of prime-age women participating in the labor force on record since 1948. The previous high of 77.3 percent in April 2000 has been surpassed in each of the last eight months. The record labor force participation of this group has served to boost incomes of American households and keep consumer spending strong.

In 2023, the economy achieved the smallest gap on record between the employment rates for Black versus white American workers, averaging–0.7 percentage point. The strong economy fostered by President Biden’s economic policies reduced some long-running inequities in the labor market and squeezed this gap to its lowest level on record.

Consumer sentiment improved in 2023.

With more work to do on lowering costs, consumer sentiment has further room to grow. However, 2023 saw momentum in the recovery of consumer attitudes. One way to see this is by tracking the same workers over time in the University of Michigan Survey of Consumer Sentiment.

Renewable energy and higher investments can boost growth, and support conditions toward a more inclusive economy

Chile’s economy is at a crossroads. Strong policies have successfully brought down high inflation and reduced the large current account deficit that emerged during the pandemic. Increases in social benefits have provided some relief in response to discontent over inequality. However, investment and growth are still tepid and social gaps remain high.

Going forward, Chile—the world’s largest copper producer, second largest lithium producer, and richly endowed with solar and wind—can both contribute to, and benefit from, the global green transition. A more dynamic and greener economy could also create conditions for greater equity and inclusion.

Boosting economic activity

Chile has a comparative advantage in renewable energy production. Costs of electricity generation are lower for solar and wind than fossil fuels thanks to the high solar radiation in Chile’s north and strong winds in the south. Already, electricity generated from solar and wind increased from 1 to 23 percent of total electricity supply during 2010–22.



Our estimates suggest that replacing coal with renewable energy, along the lines of the authorities’ plans to decommission coal-fired power plants by 2040, could boost economic activity by at least 1 percent over the long term. Such a shift in the energy mix would imply a nearly 30 percent cost reduction in electricity generation, in addition to the benefits from lower carbon emissions and air pollution. A shift in Chile’s energy mix would also significantly strengthen the economy’s resilience against future coal and fuel price shocks.

Development of the green hydrogen industry could offer additional growth prospects, conditional on further reductions in the production and transportation costs. The geographic mismatch between power generation and consumption is the main bottleneck for greater use of renewable energy. In particular, the areas rich in solar and wind in the northern and southern parts of Chile are more than 1,000 miles away from its economic hub in the central area. This could be resolved by upgrading the transmission network, including through the new Kimal-Lo Aguirre transmission line set to become operational in 2029.

New opportunities

Chile also has an opportunity to play a role in global efforts to reduce carbon emissions. This involves the greater use of lithium for energy storage in batteries. The resulting higher global demand for lithium offers prospects to expand Chile’s lithium production and related industries along the value chain, while balancing social and environmental objectives.

For Chile, lithium has already become an important source of exports and fiscal revenue in recent years when the lithium price surged. The country is planning to expand its lithium production through public-private partnerships. Providing a clear institutional framework for investors that can be swiftly implemented as global demand ramps up will be an important factor to further develop the industry.

More investment needed

While Chile’s economy is projected to resume growth in 2024, its average real economic growth rate has been declining for many years alongside negative productivity growth. Therefore, strengthening investment is critical to sustainably raise and diversify economic activity.

Investment approvals have become more complicated, uncertain, and lengthier over the years, largely reflecting more complex safeguards for the environment, health, safety, social concerns, and a larger number of stakeholders.

The government’s ongoing efforts to streamline and improve coordination of permitting processes, while maintaining high environmental standards, could contribute to lifting much-needed investment and bring meaningful growth dividends.

While some maintain that two consecutive quarters of falling real GDP constitute a recession, that is neither the official definition nor the way economists evaluate the state of the business cycle. Instead, both official determinations of recessions and economists’ assessment of economic activity are based on a holistic look at the data—including the labor market, consumer and business spending, industrial production, and incomes. Based on these data, it is unlikely that the decline in GDP in the first quarter of this year—even if followed by another GDP decline in the second quarter—indicates a recession.

The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) Business Cycle Dating Committee—the official recession scorekeeper—defines a recession as “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.” The variables the committee typically tracks include real personal income minus government transfers, employment, various forms of real consumer spending, and industrial production. Notably, there are no fixed rules or thresholds that trigger a determination of decline, although the committee does note that in recent decades, they have given more weight to real personal income less transfers and payroll employment.

Also, because the committee depends on government statistics that are reported at various lags, it cannot officially designate a recession until after it starts.[1] So how might the NBER committee assess the health of the economy?

Figure 1 shows the trend in four of the NBER committee’s recession-indicator variables—real income minus transfers, real spending, industrial production, and employment—relative to their values in April 2020 (the trough of the last recession, and thus, the month before the current expansion began). All of these indicators have exhibited strong growth in the U.S. economy since the start of the pandemic, and have continued to expand through the first half of this year. And while real income net of transfers has been flat in recent months, industrial production, employment, and real spending have grown this year. The committee does not directly consider inflation; however, it is embedded in the real income and spending variables it tracks, including those plotted in Figure 1. Those data show that while inflation is highly elevated, real spending is still growing, powered by one of the strongest labor markets on record and an elevated stock of household savings.

The fact that the NBER committee looks for a “significant decline” in activity that is broad-based puts this year’s 1.6 percent rate contraction in first quarter real GDP into context. Far from being a broad contraction, the negative estimate of the growth rate was a function of inventories—one of the noisiest components of GDP growth[2]—and net exports, in part reflecting our economic strength relative to that of our trading partners, as well as less snarled global supply chains. Private domestic final demand—consumer spending and fixed investment (which together make up over 80 percent of nominal GDP)—grew at a 3.0 percent real annualized rate in the first quarter, demonstrating solid, above-trend growth. And payroll employment grew at an even stronger 4.7 percent annualized rate, followed by 3.4 percent in Q2. In fact, the 1.1 million jobs created in the second quarter—an average of around 375,000 jobs per month—is more than three times more jobs created than in any three-month period leading up to a recession.

Finally, although the unemployment rate is not on the committee’s list, the fact that it has held at a historically low 3.6 percent in the past four months also has bearing on the recession question. A widely cited indicator of recessions (the “Sahm rule” named after economist Claudia Sahm) maintains that a recession is likely underway when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises by at least half a percentage point (50 basis points) relative to its lowest point in the previous 12 months. The fact that the Sahm indicator is 0, far below its 50 basis-point threshold, provides yet another indication that the economic expansion is ongoing.

Recession probabilities are never zero, but trends in the data through the first half of this year used to determine a recession are not indicating a downturn.

Looking ahead, we know that the U.S., along with the rest of the global economy, faces significant headwinds—and little relevant data are yet available on the third quarter (2022Q3). At the same time, there is a good chance that the strength of the labor market and of consumer balance sheets help the economy transition from the rapid growth of the last year to steadier and more stable growth. But, whatever path the economy takes, CEA will continue to carefully track these indicators to assess the state of the economic cycle.

[1] In fact, when recessions are short-lived, the committee typically announces them after they are over.

[2] Inventories in the GDP accounts reflect not a level change, as for example, with consumer spending, but a change in a change, i.e., whether inventories were growing or shrinking faster or slower than the previous quarter. In fact, the level of inventories rose in 2022 Q1, just not as fast as in the previous quarter.","(0, 'GDP')"

Peru continues to be one of Latin America’s best-performing economies, but growth has lost momentum in recent years, due to both domestic and external factors, according to the IMF’s latest annual economic assessment.

Even though economic activity is expected to pick up some steam in 2020—supported by improvements in exports and domestic demand—boosting long-term growth prospects will require narrowing the large infrastructure gaps in various ways and tackling social spending, as well as corruption, the IMF said in its report.



Here are six key takeaways from the latest report.

Economic performance: Peru has been one of the fastest-growing economies in the region, but last year growth weakened to 2.4 percent owing to a combination of external and domestic factors. On the external front, Peru saw reduced demand for its exports of primary products, with mining and fuel exports contracting during the year. Domestically, the execution of public investment projects was lower than planned in the budget, while weather-related factors hampered fishing production.

Agro-exporting boom: Over the past two decades, Peru has experienced a boom in agricultural exports, led by seasonal exports to the northern hemisphere of high-value fresh fruits and vegetables (mostly grapes, avocados, blueberries, and asparagus). This boom has contributed to reducing poverty in rural areas, which declined from 80 percent in 2004 to 36 percent in 2018, and even more in some areas that saw larger expansion of agro-exports.

The US economy has recovered quickly from the pandemic but the bounce back in demand has stressed supply chains and caused inflation to rise sharply. The economy is expected to slow, as the Federal Reserve (the Fed) continues to tighten monetary policy and COVID economic relief programs come to an end, bringing core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) inflation down to the Fed’s 2 percent medium-term target by late 2023. However, if inflation is more persistent than expected, the Fed will need to tighten more, which will further slow the economy.

The IMF’s annual review of the US economy focuses on the policies needed to return inflation to the Fed’s medium-term target. Most workers’ wages have failed to keep up with inflation, eroding the purchasing power of households and causing significant hardship. Although increases in gasoline and food prices have been affected by global events, the prices of a broader range of items have also risen strongly, including housing and transportation. If left unchecked, these price increases could become long lasting. In our assessment, we conclude that the Fed should act quickly and assertively to tackle inflation and restore price stability.

Policy action

The Fed increased its policy rates by 1.5 percent so far this year and is likely to increase them by another 2 or 2.5 percent in the coming months. It is also unwinding its holdings of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. As a result, the cost of borrowing has significantly increased. For example, the average fixed rate on a 30-year mortgage has already risen from 3 percent to between 5 and 6 percent since the start of this year. At the same time, the government is reining in spending, as a range of pandemic-era support programs are expiring.

We expect these policy actions will slow the growth in consumer spending to around zero by early next year, easing the strain on supply chains. At the same time, higher mortgage rates will reduce housing prices, which have grown strongly during the pandemic. Finally, slowing demand will increase unemployment to around 5 percent by the end of 2023, which should decrease wages.

All in all, we expect core PCE inflation to fall back toward 2 percent by late 2023, and economic activity to slow from 3.5 percent in the first quarter of this year to 0.6 percent by end‑2023.

Risks ahead

US economic developments will be impacted by global factors, such as the Russian war with Ukraine, the ongoing pandemic, and possible recurrence of shutdowns in China. Also, the longer inflation stays high, the bigger the risk that inflation expectations move up, which then feeds back into wages and prices. In that case, the Fed would need to take stronger action to bring inflation down, raising interest rates and keeping them higher for a longer period. This would lower growth further and lead to higher unemployment.

An inclusive recovery

While the Fed policies required to lower inflation may result in short-term costs on households and firms, they will help restore price stability and lay the foundations for strong economic growth and low unemployment. To support growth over the medium to long term, the US government can use fiscal measures to invest in reforms to expand the size of the labor force, improve productivity, and incentivize innovation and investment. These could include increased government support for paid family leave, childcare, pre-school, and access to a college education; tax credits that help women, minorities, and lower-income workers join the workforce; and immigration reform that is targeted toward expanding the labor force and strengthening skills.

The US Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to restore price stability and to bring balance to the labor market. The demand for new hires is exceeding the supply of available workers in the US, as the unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level in over 50 years, and this has contributed to higher inflation. To help bring the economy back into balance, IMF analysis shows that staying the course and keeping interest rates elevated this year will tame inflation. Although these higher rates will temporarily increase unemployment, they will pave the way for stable inflation and sustainable economic growth, which will ultimately help create more jobs in the future.

When prices began rising in 2021, they were initially limited to goods affected by pandemic-related disruptions, such as vehicles. However, by early 2022, rising prices had spread to housing and other services such as hotels and restaurants. Growth of prices in the personal consumption expenditure index is now around 5½ percent, well above the 2 percent target.

A hot labor market

Since mid-2021, as the US economy rapidly recovered, the demand for workers has far outstripped the supply. Workers have become more likely to quit jobs and look for new ones, and early retirements have also held down the supply of available workers. These factors have ultimately increased workers’ bargaining power to negotiate pay raises, contributing to both higher wages and prices, as firms increased prices to cover rising wage costs. This has especially been the case in labor-intensive industries, such as hotels and restaurants.

A balancing act

The Fed’s mandate is to achieve price stability and maximum employment. To achieve these, model-based analysis by Fund staff using the Fed’s FRBUS model shows that the Fed could achieve these goals by raising interest rates to a peak of 4-5 percent, sustaining that for around 1-1½ years, taking into account workers’ strong bargaining position and the high number of vacancies per unemployed worker. The higher interest rates would weaken the demand for workers and increase unemployment modestly. This would reduce the pressure for large wage and price increases, particularly in the services sector, helping to lower inflation.

Where things stand

Most Federal Open Market Committee members project further interest rate hikes, so that the federal funds rate would remain around 5–5½ percent at the end of 2023. There are encouraging signs that the Fed’s policy moves are having the intended impact. Inflation slowed in the last quarter of 2022 (relative to the summer), driven by declining goods prices. However, inflation in services prices remains elevated and will likely only fall once wage growth slows.

Bringing inflation down to the Fed’s 2 percent target is crucial for stable job growth and sustainable increases in incomes over the medium to long-run, and it will offset the cost of temporarily higher unemployment.

The country leads Latin America in rapidly narrowing the income gap with the United States

Despite being one of Latin America’s poorest countries in the mid-1960s, the Dominican Republic has made remarkable progress in terms of income convergence.

Income convergence is typically measured by comparing the per capita income of a country to that of a more prosperous nation, often the United States. For the Dominican Republic, this ratio reached 32 percent in 2022, indicating that the country’s standard of living is approximately one-third that of the United States. This stands in contrast to Latin America as a whole, where the average standard of living is around one-quarter that of the United States.

With the right policies, the country has the potential to become an advanced economy in the next 40 years.

Converging at “blue” speed

What is remarkable about the Dominican Republic’s progress is not just the level of convergence but also its speed compared to other countries in the region. By examining the average convergence velocity, or the rate of change in income convergence per decade, it is evident that the Dominican Republic has exhibited the highest average convergence velocity, or “blue shift,” in Latin America over the past 50 years. Panama and Chile have achieved equally meaningful but still lower positive convergence velocities, while the majority of countries in the region have experienced either very low (“green shift”) or negative (“red shift”) convergence velocities.

Despite encountering challenges, such as the debt crisis of the 1980s, the Dominican Republic’s economy has been converging at a faster rate. The convergence velocity has increased from an average of 3 percentage points per decade over the last 50 years to almost 8 percentage points per decade more recently. This remarkable performance can be attributed to several factors, including implementation of sound policies, particularly by the central bank, improvements in policy framework, a more diversified export base, and the economy’s structural flexibility to changing global conditions.

From agricultural roots to economic dynamism

Over the last half century, the Dominican Republic has transformed, first from a primarily agricultural-based to a more manufacturing-oriented economy supported by the growth of free trade zones, and subsequently to a services-driven economy bolstered by the exploitation of the country’s tourism potential and the expansion of the financial system.

Today, the country maintains a balanced mix of industries and sectors, including agriculture, manufacturing, and services, and boasts the sixth highest per capital GDP in Latin America when accounting for purchasing power, surpassing regional giants like Brazil and Mexico.

Such dynamism has played a crucial role in reducing poverty by two-thirds over the past three decades and reducing inequality, with the Gini coefficient falling by a quarter, indicating a continued positive trend towards more equal distribution of income.

This progress has impacted the average Dominican family, whose purchasing power has increased fourfold in the last 50 years, enabling them to enjoy a better quality of life and greater economic opportunities.

The sound policies that led to Dominican Republic’s high growth required timely policy adjustments, often in response to shocks and changing conditions. In this regard, IMF-supported programs through various crises have played an important role.

Prioritizing reforms for sustained growth

Looking ahead, there are reasons to believe that the Dominican Republic can sustain its high growth. IMF staff estimates potential growth at 5 percent per year, similar to the average of the last 50 years.

To fuel higher potential growth, the Dominican Republic can prioritize key structural reforms. This includes enhancing the quality of education to boost workforce productivity; completing electricity sector reform to improve distribution, eliminate blackouts, and enhance renewable energy adoption; strengthening the resilience of the tourism and agricultural sectors against natural disasters and climate change; addressing labor market informality for better job quality; further improving the business climate to achieve investment grade status to attract higher levels of investment; and embracing technology and fostering innovation.

While risks lie ahead—particularly those associated with climate change—continued implementation of reforms aimed at fostering productivity can help maintain high growth rates, pave the way for a prosperous future for its people, and eventually transform the Dominican Republic into an advanced economy by approximately 2060. Such progress would represent a significant “blue shift” in the country’s history and serve as undeniable evidence of its ongoing development.

In retrospect, the resilience has been remarkable. Despite war-disrupted energy and food markets and unprecedented monetary tightening to combat decades-high inflation, economic activity has slowed but not stalled. Even so, growth remains slow and uneven, with widening divergences.

The global economy is limping along, not sprinting.

According to our latest projections, world economic growth will slow from 3.5 percent in 2022 to 3 percent this year and 2.9 percent next year, a 0.1 percentage point downgrade for 2024 from July. This remains well below the historical average.

Headline inflation continues to decelerate, from 9.2 percent in 2022 on a year-over-year basis, to 5.9 percent this year and 4.8 percent in 2024. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, is also projected to decline, albeit more gradually, to 4.5 percent next year. Most countries aren’t likely to return inflation to target until 2025.

As a result, projections are increasingly consistent with a soft landing scenario, bringing inflation down without a major downturn in activity, especially in the United States, where our forecast increase in unemployment is now modest, from 3.6 percent to 3.9 percent by 2025.

But important divergences are appearing, leaving activity in some regions much below pre-pandemic projections. The slowdown is more pronounced in advanced economies than in their emerging market and developing counterparts. Among advanced economies, the US growth outlook has been revised up, with resilient consumption and investment, while euro area activity was revised downward. Many emerging market economies also proved unexpectedly resilient, with the notable exception of China, which faces growing headwinds from its real estate crisis and weakening confidence.

Three forces are at play:

The recovery in services is almost complete and the strong demand that supported services-oriented economies is now softening.

Tighter credit conditions are weighing on housing markets, investment, and activity, more so in countries with a higher share of adjustable-rate mortgages or where households are less willing, or able, to dip into their savings. Firm bankruptcies are increasing in some economies, although from historically low levels. Countries are now at different points in their hiking cycle: advanced economies (except Japan) are near the peak, while some emerging market economies that started hiking earlier, such as Brazil and Chile, have already started easing.

Inflation and economic activity are shaped by last year’s commodity price shock. Economies heavily dependent on Russian energy imports saw a steeper increase in energy prices and a sharper slowdown. The passthrough from higher energy prices played a large role in driving core inflation higher in the euro area—unlike the United States, where core inflation pressures instead reflect a tight labor market.

Despite signs of softening, labor markets in advanced economies remain buoyant with historically low unemployment rates helping to support activity. Real wages are catching up, but there is scant evidence of a wage-price spiral. Further, many countries experienced a sharp—and welcome—compression in the earnings distribution, with the higher amenity value of flexible and remote work schedules reducing wage pressures for high earners.

Gauging risks

While some of the extreme risks—such as severe banking instability—have moderated since April, the balance remains tilted to the downside.

China’s real-estate crisis could intensify, posing a complex policy challenge. Restoring confidence requires promptly restructuring struggling property developers, preserving financial stability, and addressing the strains in local public finance.

If China’s real estate prices decline too rapidly, the balance sheets of banks and households will worsen, with the potential for serious financial amplification. Artificially supporting real estate prices may temporarily protect balance sheets, but this will crowd out other investment opportunities, reduce new construction, and hurt local government revenues through reduced land sales. Either way, China’s economy must pivot away from growth that relies on credit for the real estate sector.

Meanwhile, commodity prices could become more volatile amid climate and geopolitical shocks, a serious risk to disinflation. Between June and late September, oil prices had increased by about 25 percent amid extended supply cuts by OPEC Plus, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and selected nonmembers, before falling back by about 11 percent. Food prices remain elevated and could be further disrupted by an escalation of the war in Ukraine, inflicting greater hardship on many low-income countries. Geoeconomic fragmentation has also led to a sharp increase in the dispersion in commodity prices across regions, including critical minerals. This could pose serious macroeconomic risks, including to the climate transition, as we show in Chapter 3 of our latest World Economic Outlook.

And, while both underlying and headline inflation have decreased, they remain uncomfortably high. Near-term inflation expectations have risen markedly above target, although they now appear to be turning a corner. As Chapter 2 of the WEO details, bringing these near-term inflation expectations back down is critical to winning the battle against inflation.

In addition, fiscal buffers have eroded in many countries, with elevated debt levels, rising funding costs, slowing growth, and an increasing mismatch between the growing demands on the state and available fiscal resources. This leaves many countries more vulnerable to crises and demands a renewed focus on managing fiscal risks.

Finally, despite tightening monetary policy, financial conditions have eased in many countries, as detailed in the latest Global Financial Stability Report. The danger is of a sharp repricing of risk, especially for emerging markets, that would further strengthen the US dollar, trigger capital outflows, and increase borrowing costs and debt distress.

Policy priorities

Under our baseline scenario, inflation continues to recede as central banks maintain a tight stance and avoid easing prematurely. Once the disinflation process is firmly established, with decreasing near-term inflation expectations and inflation targets coming into sight, gradually cutting the policy rate will be appropriate, while maintaining a commitment to price stability.

Fiscal policy needs to rebuild buffers, including by removing energy subsidies, while still protecting the vulnerable. This will also aid disinflation. Fiscal and monetary policies pulled in the same direction last year as many pandemic emergency fiscal measures were unwound, but they are less aligned this year. The substantial widening of the fiscal deficit in the United States is most worrying, as fiscal policy should not be pro-cyclical, especially at this stage of the inflation cycle.

We should also return our focus to the dimming medium-term outlook. Global growth prospects are weak, especially for emerging market and developing economies. The implications are profound: a much slower convergence toward the living standards of advanced economies, reduced fiscal space, increased debt vulnerabilities and exposure to shocks, and diminished opportunities to overcome the scarring from the pandemic and the war.

With lower growth, higher interest rates and reduced fiscal space, structural reforms become key. Higher long-term growth can be achieved with a careful sequencing of reforms, starting with those focused on governance, business regulation and the external sector. These first-generation reforms help unlock growth and make subsequent reforms—whether to credit markets, or for the green transition—much more effective.

Multilateral cooperation can help ensure countries achieve better growth outcomes. Countries should avoid implementing policies that contravene World Trade Organization rules and distort international commerce. And countries should safeguard the flow of critical minerals, needed for the climate transition, and of agricultural commodities. Such “green corridors” would help reduce volatility and accelerate the green transition.

Finally, all countries should prevent geoeconomic fragmentation that impedes progress toward a shared prosperity. Instead, they should work to restore trust in rules-based multilateral frameworks that enhance transparency and policy certainty. A robust global financial safety net with a well-resourced IMF at its center is essential.","(0, 'GDP')"

In the near term, the signs of progress are undeniable.

The COVID-19 health crisis is officially over, and supply-chain disruptions have returned to pre-pandemic levels. Economic activity in the first quarter of the year proved resilient, despite the challenging environment, amid surprisingly strong labor markets. Energy and food prices have come down sharply from their war-induced peaks, allowing global inflation pressures to ease faster than expected. And financial instability following the March banking turmoil remains contained thanks to forceful action by the US and Swiss authorities.

Yet many challenges still cloud the horizon, and it is too early to celebrate.

Under our baseline forecast growth will slow from last year’s 3.5 percent to 3 percent this year and next, a 0.2 percentage points upgrade for 2023 from our April projections. Global inflation is projected to decline from 8.7 percent last year to 6.8 percent this year, a 0.2 percentage point downward revision, and 5.2 percent in 2024.

The slowdown is concentrated in advanced economies, where growth will fall from 2.7 percent in 2022 to 1.5 percent this year and remain subdued at 1.4 percent next year. The euro area, still reeling from last year’s sharp spike in gas prices caused by the war, is set to decelerate sharply.

By contrast, growth in emerging markets and developing economies is still expected to pick-up with year-on-year growth accelerating from 3.1 percent in 2022 to 4.1 percent this year and next. (The corresponding annual growth, shown on the chart below, is 4 percent for 2022 and 2023 and 4.1% for 2024.)

This average, however, masks significant differences between countries, with emerging and developing Asia growing strongly at 5.3 percent this year, while many commodity producers will suffer from a decline in export revenues.

Risks

Stronger growth and lower inflation than expected are welcome news, suggesting the global economy is headed in the right direction. Yet, while some adverse risks have moderated, the balance remains tilted to the downside.

First, signs are growing that global activity is losing momentum. The global tightening of monetary policy has brought policy rates into contractionary territory. This has started to weigh on activity, slowing the growth of credit to the non-financial sector, increasing households’ and firms’ interest payments, and putting pressure on real estate markets. In the United States, excess savings from the pandemic-related transfers, which helped households weather the cost-of-living crisis and tighter credit conditions, are all but depleted. In China, the recovery following the re-opening of its economy shows signs of losing steam amid continued concerns about the property sector, with implications for the global economy.

Second, core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, remains well above central banks’ targets, and is expected to decline gradually from 6 percent this year to 4.7 percent in 2024, a 0.4 percentage points upward revision. More worrisome, core inflation in advanced economies is expected to remain unchanged at a 5.1 percent annual average rate this year, before declining to 3.1 percent in 2024. Clearly, the battle against inflation is not yet won.

Key to inflation’s persistence will be labor market developments and wage-profit dynamics. Labor markets remain a particularly bright spot, with unemployment rates below, and employment levels above, their pre-COVID levels in many economies. Overall wage inflation has increased but remains behind price inflation in most countries. The reason is simple and has little to do with so-called ”greedflation”: prices adjust upward faster than wages when nominal demand far exceeds what the economy can produce. As a result, real wages have declined, by about 3.8 percent between the first quarter of 2022 and 2023 for advanced and large emerging market economies.

Lower real wages translate to reduced labor costs. This may explain part of the strength of the labor market despite slowing growth. But in many countries, the observed increase in employment goes beyond what the decline in labor costs would suggest. It is fair to say that the reasons are not fully understood.

If labor markets remain strong, we should expect—and welcome—real wages recovering lost ground. This means nominal wage growth will remain strong for a while even as price inflation declines. Indeed, the gap between the two has started to close. Because average firms’ profit margins have grown robustly in the last two years, I remain confident that there is room to accommodate the rebound in real wages without triggering a wage-price spiral. With inflation expectations well-anchored in major economies, and the economy slowing, market pressures should help contain the pass-through from labor costs to prices.

These labor market developments matter enormously. In the near term, should economic conditions deteriorate, the risk is that firms might reverse course and sharply scale down employment. Separately, the strong recovery in employment, coupled with only modest increases in output, indicates that labor productivity—the amount of output per hour worked—has declined. Should this trend persist, this would not bode well for medium-term growth.

Despite monetary policy tightening and the slowdown in bank lending, financial conditions have eased since the banking stress in March. Equity market valuations surged, especially in the artificial intelligence segment of the tech sector. The dollar depreciated further, driven by market expectations of a more benign path for US interest rates and stronger risk appetite, providing some relief to emerging and developing countries. Going forward, there is a danger of a sharp repricing—should inflation surprise to the upside or global risk appetite deteriorate—causing a flight toward dollar safe assets, higher borrowing costs and increased debt distress.

Policies

Hopefully, with inflation starting to recede, we have entered the final stage of the inflationary cycle that started in 2021. But hope is not a policy, and the touchdown may prove quite tricky to execute. Risks to inflation are now more balanced and most major economies are less likely to need additional outsized increases in policy rates. Rates have already peaked in some Latin American economies. Yet, it is critical to avoid easing rates prematurely, that is, until underlying inflation shows clear and sustained signs of cooling. We are not there yet. All the while, central banks should continue to monitor the financial system and stand ready to use their other tools to maintain financial stability.

After years of heavy fiscal support in many countries, it is now time to gradually restore fiscal buffers, and put debt dynamics on a more sustainable footing. This will help to safeguard financial stability and to reinforce the overall credibility of the disinflation strategy. This is not a call for generalized austerity: the pace and composition of this fiscal consolidation should be mindful of the strength of private demand, while protecting the most vulnerable. Yet, some consolidation measures seem entirely appropriate. For instance, with energy prices back to their pre-pandemic levels, many fiscal measures, such as energy subsidies, should be phased out.

Fiscal space is also key to implement many needed structural reforms, especially in emerging and developing economies. This is especially important since prospects for medium-term growth in income per capita have dimmed over the past decade. The slowdown is sharper for low- and middle-income economies relative to high-income ones. In other words, prospects for catching up to higher living standards have diminished markedly. At the same time, elevated debt levels are preventing many low income and frontier economies from making the investments they need to grow faster, with high risks of debt distress in many places. Recent progress toward debt resolution for Zambia is encouraging, but faster progress for other highly indebted countries is urgently needed.

Some of the slowdown in growth reflects the spillover of harmful policies. The rise of geoeconomic fragmentation with the global economy splitting into rival blocs, will most harm emerging and developing economies that are more reliant on an integrated global economy, direct investment, and technology transfers. Insufficient progress on the climate transition will leave poorer countries more exposed to increasingly severe climate shocks and rising temperatures, even as they account for a small fraction of global emissions. On all these issues, multilateral cooperation remains the best way to ensure a safe and prosperous economy for all.","(3, 'inflation')"

This major investment in tourism and recreation asset development will drive economic growth, leading to new businesses and jobs and a stronger economy for all Pennsylvanians

Erie, PA – A new report from the Pennsylvania Tourism Office shows the tourism industry in the Commonwealth generated $76.7 billion in economic impact, supported 486,871 jobs, contributed $4.7 billion in state and local taxes, and welcomed 192.4 million visitors in 2022.

The 2022 Economic Impact of Travel and Tourism report provides state, regional, and county level estimates that demonstrate the vital importance of the travel industry to Pennsylvania’s economy. The results of the report were highlighted yesterday by Department of Community and Economic Development Deputy Secretary of Tourism Carrie Fischer Lepore at Visit Erie’s Annual Meeting in Erie, PA.

Governor Josh Shapiro understands that the travel and tourism industry touches every Pennsylvanian by creating economic opportunities while increasing the quality of life. He is committed to boosting the industry to create good jobs, strengthen businesses, and attract people to call Pennsylvania home.

Key 2022 results of the report include:

192.4 million visitors , an increase of more than 12 million from 2021

, an increase of from 2021 $76.7 billion in total economic impact

in total economic impact $4.7 billion in state and local taxes

in state and local taxes 486,871 jobs supported , which equates to 1-in-16 jobs in the state

, which equates to in the state A $7.5 billion increase in direct visitor spending to reach $45.4 billion – including hotels, restaurants, retailers and other tourism related businesses.

“This report clearly shows that tourism is a significant economic driver in Pennsylvania that injects billions of dollars into our economy and helps to fund transportation, infrastructure, education, public safety programs and other vital services provided by the Commonwealth,” said Fischer Lepore. “Each household in Pennsylvania would need to pay an additional $880 in taxes to replace the tax dollars generated by the tourism industry which were received by state and local governments in 2022. The Shapiro Administration realizes the crucial role that tourism plays in Pennsylvania’s economy, as evidenced by the proposed $15 million increase in funding in the 2024-25 budget proposal.”

Visitor spending — which supports jobs, income, and business sales — generated $9.6 billion in government revenues. State and local taxes alone tallied $4.65 billion in 2022, an increase of $458 million from 2021.

Overnight visitor spending increased by $4.8 billion, with more than 66 million trips resulting in $28 billion in spending. Overnight visitors spent $419 per person, a $31 increase from 2021; while spending on day trips grew to $17.3 billion.

The Economic Impact of Travel and Tourism report is compiled at the Pennsylvania Tourism Office at DCED with information provide by Tourism Economics, an Oxford Economics Company based in Wayne, with data supplied by Longwoods International and STR.

As one of the largest industries in Pennsylvania, Governor Shapiro recognizes the key role tourism plays in the Commonwealth’s economy. Gov. Shapiro’s 2024-25 budget calls for a $15 million increase in funding for tourism.

History shows COVID-19’s economic fallout may be with us for decades

The COVID-19 pandemic’s toll on economic activity in recent months is only the beginning of the story. While the rapid and unprecedented collapse of production, trade, and employment may be reversed as the pandemic eases, historical data suggest that long-term economic consequences could persist for a generation or more.

Among these are a prolonged period of depressed real interest rates—akin to secular stagnation—that may linger for two decades or more. Still, one piece of good news is that these sustained periods of low borrowing costs are associated with higher real wages and create ample room for governments to finance stimulus measures to counteract economic damage caused by the pandemic.

Research on the economic fallout of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has so far naturally focused on the short-term impacts from mitigation and containment strategies. However, as governments engage in large-scale counter-pandemic fiscal programs, it is important to understand what the economic landscape will look like in the years and decades to come. That landscape will shape monetary and fiscal policy in ways that are not yet fully understood.

A look at previous pandemics, going back to the Black Death in the 1300s, can help fill this gap by shedding light on their medium- to long-term economic effects. In extrapolating from historical trends, though, it’s important to note one crucial distinction. Past pandemics such as the Black Death occurred at times when virtually no one survived to old age. With today’s longer life spans, perhaps this time may be different: COVID-19 mortality appears to disproportionately affect the elderly, who typically no longer participate in the labor force and tend to save more than the young.

Pandemics and macroeconomics

Historical studies have typically focused on one event, in one country or region, and have traced local outcomes a decade at most. But in large-scale pandemics, effects will be felt across whole economies, or across wider regions, for two reasons: either because the infection itself is widespread or because trade and market integration eventually propagate the economic shock across the map.

In a new paper, Jordà, Singh, and Taylor (2020), we take a global view of the macroeconomic consequences of pandemics across a number of European economies. We focus on the aftermath of 15 large pandemic events with at least 100,000 deaths, which are listed in the table.

Using newly available data on yields of long-term sovereign debt stretching back to the 14th century (Schmelzing 2020), we estimate the response of a so-called real (after-inflation) natural rate of interest in Europe following a major pandemic. In what follows, we refer simply to the “natural rate.”

Economists speak of the natural, or neutral, rate of interest as the equilibrium level that would keep the economy growing at its potential rate with stable inflation. In the long run, the relative demand and supply of loanable funds by savers and borrowers determine the natural rate.

The natural rate is an important economic barometer. For example, as populations become more frugal, the relative supply of savings increases; when the underlying pace of growth wanes, investment becomes less attractive—in both cases, the natural rate declines to restore equilibrium.

As shown in Chart 1, pandemics have long-lasting effects on interest rates. Following a pandemic, the response of the natural rate of interest is tilted down by nearly 1.5 percentage points about 20 years later. For perspective, that decline is comparable to what we have experienced from the mid-1980s to today. We also find that it takes an additional 20 years for the natural rate to return to its original level.

Staggering findings

These results are staggering and speak to the large economic effects pandemics have had over the centuries. It is well known that after major recessions caused by financial crises, real safe rates—which are closely tied to the natural rate—can be depressed for 5 to 10 years (Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor 2013), but the persistence of the responses here is even more pronounced.

The evidence presented in Chart 1 is consistent with the well-known neoclassical growth model. Loss of labor without parallel destruction of capital leads to a rebalancing of the relative returns to labor and capital. The resulting drop in interest rates may also be amplified by increased saving by pandemic survivors—they may simply wish to rebuild their wealth or may just be more frugal out of caution.

If this explanation is correct, we should see a very different pattern following a quite different type of historical event that also leads to massive loss of life: war. Unlike pandemics, major armed conflicts also result in destruction of crops, land, structures, and machinery: in other words, the loss of capital.

To explore further, we extended our initial estimates to include major wars that resulted in large loss of life (and large loss of land, structures, and other traditional forms of capital). The results could not be clearer. In wars, the relative loss of capital to labor tilts the interest rate response up, not down, as Chart 1 also shows. Wars tend to leave real interest rates elevated for 30 to 40 years, and in an economically (and statistically) significant way.

If the neoclassical mechanism is correct, there is another dimension where the effects of pandemics should be visible. As the labor-to-capital ratio declines, the natural rate should decline but real wages should increase. Chart 2 shows the response of the real wage to pandemics; it rises gradually so that, 40 years out, the real wage is about 10 percent higher. This pattern is thus consistent with the logic of the neoclassical growth model.

Net result

The great historical pandemics of the past millennium have typically been associated with subsequent low returns on assets. Measured by deviations in the natural rate of interest, these responses indicate that pandemics are followed by sustained periods—over multiple decades—with depressed real interest rates. This may reflect a lack of needed investment (because of excess capital per unit of surviving labor), an increased desire to save (out of caution, greater uncertainty, or a desire to rebuild depleted wealth), or both.

If the historical trends we have highlighted play out similarly in the wake of COVID-19, then secular stagnation (Summers 2014) would be a concern for monetary and fiscal stabilization policy for the next two decades or more.

But should we expect declines of 1.5 percent to 2 percent in the natural rate this time? There are at least three factors that will likely attenuate the decline of the natural rate.

First, the death toll of COVID-19 relative to the total population could be smaller than that of some of the major pandemics of the past, if modern medical care and public health measures are more effective.

Second, COVID-19 affects primarily the elderly, who are no longer in the labor force and tend to save relatively more than the young—a big difference from past centuries, when people had shorter life expectancies.

Third, aggressive counter-pandemic fiscal expansion will further boost public debt, reducing the national saving rate and possibly putting upward pressure on real interest rates.

On net, we still expect a sustained period of low real interest rates (though attenuated by the factors we discussed). Low real rates should then provide welcome fiscal space for governments to aggressively mitigate the consequences of the pandemic.

State of the City Commitment Will Grow City's Green Economy, Train and Position New Yorkers to Benefit from Nearly 400,000 Green-Collar Jobs by 2040

Plan Will Advance $100 Million Climate Innovation Hub at Brooklyn Army Terminal, Create More Than 12,000 Green Economy Apprenticeships by 2040

Climate Collaborative Across Brooklyn Army Terminal, Governors Island, Brooklyn Navy Yard to Deliver 6-Million-Square-Feet for Climate Education, Research, Commercialization, and Training

NEW YORK – New York City Mayor Eric Adams, New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) President and CEO Andrew Kimball, and Mayor's Office of Talent and Workforce Development (NYCTalent) Executive Director Abby Jo Sigal today announced the release of the Green Economy Action Plan — a first-of-its-kind plan that lays out a roadmap to growing the city's green economy. The plan invests in jobs and sectors that will help the city combat climate change, and train and position New Yorkers — particularly those from environmentally-disadvantaged communities — to benefit from the nearly 400,000 projected 'green-collar' jobs in New York City by 2040.

Critical to this plan is the creation of a new ""Climate Innovation Hub"" at the Brooklyn Army Terminal, which will help grow green technology startups and businesses, and which will be joined together with the Trust for Governors Island and the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation to create a green economy ecosystem across three campuses that will support 5,000 new permanent jobs, educate and train 2,100 New Yorkers, and generate $55 billion of economic impact. The Green Economy Action Plan delivers on another promise in Mayor Adams' State of the City address, and builds on his commitment to invest in future-focused industries and create a ""Harbor of the Future"" with job and innovation hubs along the East River.

""Our city didn't recover the nearly 1 million jobs we lost during the pandemic and reach a new private-sector job high by looking backward — we did it by building an economy of the future. And we must draw on all our resources to protect our city from the effects of climate change,"" said Mayor Adams. ""From building resiliency projects and retrofitting apartment buildings, to installing solar panels, EV charging stations, and wind turbines, 'green-collar' jobs are already in demand and leading the way. Our Green Economy Action Plan will harness the growth of a new kind of industrial revolution and give New Yorkers the tools they need to build a resilient and prosperous city and thrive in our future-focused economy.""

The Green Economy Action Plan delivers the first forecasting of New York City's green economy and job growth through 2040. New York City's green economy will host nearly 400,000 jobs by 2040 — up from 133,000 today — as it becomes the anchor of a prosperous, equitable, and just future for New Yorkers, while it simultaneously advances the city's ambitious goals to reduce the city's threats due to climate change. The plan identifies key occupations that are essential to growing the green economy and highlights 21 occupations that provide pathways to economic mobility, many of which do not require higher education degrees.

Highlights of the plan include:

Establishing a Climate Innovation Hub: NYCEDC will invest up to $100 million to develop a Climate Innovation Hub at the Brooklyn Army Terminal. This new space will accelerate commercialization pathways for climate tech startups and other green economy businesses. It will serve 150 startups over 10 years — generating $2.6 billion in economic impact and creating 600 jobs — while providing local workforce training and job placement, particularly for the local Sunset Park community.

Activating Public Sites for Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging: NYCEDC is activating two acres of land near JFK airport to create the largest EV charging facility in the city, with 65 public EV chargers including 12 rapid ones. The facility is currently estimated to charge 1,000 vehicles per year, with potential for growth depending on market demand. The Brooklyn Navy Yard is also installing over 80 EV chargers across its 300-acre campus, including infrastructure for commercial fleet charging and a dedicated public lot for neighboring residents. Together, these investments constitute some of the largest investments in EV infrastructure in outer borough job centers in New York City to date.

The facility is currently estimated to charge 1,000 vehicles per year, with potential for growth depending on market demand. The Brooklyn Navy Yard is also installing over 80 EV chargers across its 300-acre campus, including infrastructure for commercial fleet charging and a dedicated public lot for neighboring residents. Together, these investments constitute some of the largest investments in EV infrastructure in outer borough job centers in New York City to date. Creating Tax Incentives for Battery Storage: NYCEDC will utilize New York City's Industrial Development Agency tax incentives to activate 500 Megawatts (MW) of battery storage capacity and support other green economy uses. To date, the Industrial Development Agency has induced 200MW of storage capacity that is expected to come online in the coming years and generated nearly $500 million of private sector investment. Unlocking additional storage capacity will ultimately drive a stronger and more efficient renewable energy sector.

""The Green Economy Action Plan is an integrated talent and economic development strategy for the five boroughs and another example of the Adams administration's work connecting New Yorkers to family-sustaining jobs, spurring inclusive economic activity in high-growth sectors and marshaling a coordinated, citywide response to climate change,"" said Deputy Mayor for Housing, Economic, and Workforce Development Maria Torres-Springer. ""I am excited to be a part of this historic release and eager to join with New Yorkers, my colleagues in government, and partners in the private sector to create the world's most dynamic and equitable green ecosystem right here in New York.""

""Treating the climate change crisis with the urgency it requires doesn't just support our infrastructure but our economy too, with good, 'green-collar' jobs for New Yorkers with diverse educations and histories,"" said Deputy Mayor for Operations Meera Joshi. ""As unusual weather events become all too usual, we all have a role to play in protecting our city. Our city is creating the framework so that everyone can get involved.""

""This first-of-its-kind plan lays out a series of commitments and strategies that will bolster economic growth, create thousands of jobs, encourage public-private partnerships, and ensure a just transition to a green economy that all New Yorkers can contribute to and benefit from,"" said NYCEDC President & CEO Kimball. ""There is no better location for innovation than at the historic Brooklyn Army Terminal, located on the waterfront in the heart of Sunset Park, which is turning into a center for clean tech innovation and manufacturing. Climate tech growth at the Brooklyn Army Terminal will be further catalyzed by the establishment of the Climate Innovation Hub and through a unique partnership with the Brooklyn Navy Yard and the Trust for Governors Island, known as the Harbor Climate Collaborative. Collectively, these three remarkable city assets, all connected by a short NYC Ferry ride, will be at the forefront of climate innovation, commercialization, and workforce development for decades to come.""

""By co-authoring the Green Economy Action Plan, we wrote the roadmap for an historic opportunity to tackle the climate crisis, create jobs, and drive economic mobility, while positioning New York City as a global leader in the green economy,"" said NYCTalent Executive Director Sigal. ""The plan represents the city's commitment to concrete strategies to ensure that all New Yorkers contribute to and benefit from our city's growth and prosperity.""

""The Brooklyn Navy Yard is proud to be an integral partner in making New York a global destination for climate adaptation and technology development and production, and to further build on the growing community of climate solutions companies already thriving at the Yard,"" said Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation President and CEO Lindsay Greene.

""Preparing our city for climate change will require transformative collaboration and opportunities to rapidly scale solutions that benefit all New Yorkers, and the Green Economy Action Plan outlines a necessary roadmap,"" said Trust for Governors Island President and CEO Clare Newman. ""Governors Island is an exciting platform for a growing ecosystem of partners, including the New York Climate Exchange, that are advancing research, education, training, and public programs, and we're proud to join our colleagues in furthering New York City 's role as a global leader in developing equitable solutions to climate change.""

""Reducing our contributions to climate change and building the infrastructure that will make us more resilient to extreme weather represents an historic opportunity to grow and broaden our economy and workforce,"" said New York City Chief Climate Officer and New York City Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Rohit T. Aggarwala. ""As laid out in 'PlaNYC,' with the proper planning and guidance, we can help ensure that all New Yorkers are able to benefit from this once-in-a-generation opportunity.""

""As New York City makes historic investments in climate, it's imperative that we bring everyone along,"" said Mayor's Office of Climate & Environmental Justice Executive Director Elijah Hutchinson. ""Environmental justice and workforce champions know that we now have to do the hard work of making these job opportunities real for everyday New Yorkers. In tandem with apprenticeships, workforce training, local job placement, and the contribution of crucial environmental-justice advocacy groups like UPROSE, Green City Force, and the HOPE Program, this action plan advances a more just climate transition for New Yorkers.""

Through a Request for Proposal to be released on March 18, 2024, NYCEDC will seek an operator for its new Climate Innovation Hub at the Brooklyn Army Terminal. Potential partners can learn more about the vision for the hub and complete a partner form to register interest.

Climate technology companies are a particularly bright spot within New York City's green business landscape. As of 2022, the New York City metropolitan area is the third largest climate tech ecosystem in the country with 179 active climate tech companies and venture capital investments, reaching almost $4 billion in 2021. This opportunity is turbocharged by over $2 billion in venture capital funding flowing to New York City's climate tech sector since 2021, a 400 percent spike over the $500 million in investment from 2018 to 2020; ambitious city and state climate policy targets; and over $500 billion in public funding being made available at the state and federal levels to support the nation's shift to a green economy.

The Green Economy Action Plan deliver on a key commitment in Mayor Adams' ""PlaNYC: Getting Sustainability Done"" plan, New York's long-term strategic climate plan. The Green Economy Action Plan also builds on decades-long work led by advocacy environmental groups, including UPROSE, whose Green Resilient Industrial District (GRID) Plan and 'The GRID 2.0"" provide a comprehensive, community-led path to decarbonize Sunset Park and ensure a just transition towards a greener and cleaner future.

""The Green Economy Action Plan demonstrates our administration's commitment to ensuring that all New Yorkers can contribute to and benefit from a resilient and strong New York City,"" said Mayor's Office of Food Policy Executive Director Kate MacKenzie. ""We are proud to be part of a city investing in climate-resilient systems and solutions, including sustainable food distribution, production, consumption, and disposal. The plan lays out how we can continue to engage the private sector in meeting our ambitious climate goals through the city's Plant-Powered Carbon Challenge, work towards decarbonization of food distribution, and support sustainable food businesses and practices.""

""The Green Economy Action Plan is truly a win-win for New Yorkers,"" said New York City Department of City Planning Director Dan Garodnick.

Thanks to policies like this and 'City of Yes for Carbon Neutrality,' we're well on our way to a greener, healthier, more prosperous future.""

""Realizing a more sustainable and equitable transportation future entails dedicated investments in environmentally friendly initiatives and infrastructure throughout all five boroughs,"" said New York City Department of Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez. ""DOT is proud to contribute to the Green Economy Action Plan, including through our green freight, electric vehicle charging, and shared mobility programming, which foster green job opportunities for New Yorkers and propel the city towards achieving ambitious climate action goals.""

""Today marks a pivotal moment in our city's commitment toward building a more sustainable future for all New Yorkers. With the unveiling of the Green Economy Action Plan, we are not only making strides toward combating the impacts of climate change, but we are also laying the foundation for equitable economic growth,"" said New York City's Department of Buildings Commissioner Jimmy Oddo. ""The Climate Innovation Hub at the Brooklyn Army Terminal, in particular, will help foster green technology startups, which are going to be critical as larger property owners work to reduce carbon emissions from their buildings.""

""Through the Green Economy Action Plan, we're doubling down on our commitment to environmental justice and equitable workforce development, as we simultaneously embrace the challenge of climate change,"" said New York City Department of Citywide Administration Commissioner Dawn M. Pinnock. ""We are thrilled to be part of this important effort as we work together to make sure everyone gets a fair shot at a better, greener future.""

""New York City is and must continue to be a global leader in the fight against climate change. With the city's Green Economy Action Plan as our guide, we now have a clear roadmap to build a resilient, green economy in preparing for the economic and environmental realities of what's to come,"" said Dr. Stephen Hammer, CEO, New York Climate Exchange. ""The Exchange and our partners are thrilled to be part of this endeavor. We look forward to working with City Hall, entrepreneurs, community organizations, and the financial sector to identify and promote jobs for both low- and high-skilled workers that help the city meet its climate adaptation and mitigation goals.""

In April 2023, the Adams administration, Governors Island, and the State University of New York Stony Brook University unveiled the ""New York Climate Exchange,"" a transformative vision for a first-in-the-nation climate research, education, and jobs hub on Governors Island that will create thousands of permanent jobs and $1 billion in economic impact for the city. The Exchange will establish a cross-sector consortium of over 45 partner organizations, representing leading universities, businesses, and non-profit organizations, and will develop a state-of-the-art, $700-million, 400,000-square-foot campus dedicated to researching and developing innovative climate solutions that will be scaled across New York City and equip New Yorkers for green-collar jobs of the future.

Sunset Park in South Brooklyn continues to be an emerging hub for climate innovation. In March 2022, Mayor Adams announced an agreement to transform the city owned South Brooklyn Marine Terminal (SBMT) into one of the largest offshore wind port facilities in the nation. The world-class offshore wind hub at South Brooklyn Marine Terminal is projected to support the buildout, management, and interconnection of electricity generation for more than 2 million homes. Last September, NYCEDC launched Pilots at the Brooklyn Army Terminal, a climate innovation pilot program allowing companies to test and scale their technologies in live environments.

""The future of New York's economy and of American jobs is in green infrastructure,"" said U.S. Representative Dan Goldman. ""I'm thrilled to see our city preparing for and embracing this green energy future by investing in jobs that will help our city combat climate change and mitigate future extreme weather events. While we must ensure that community voices are front and center while this plan is implemented, this critically important investment and training will ensure that our economy is competitive and prepared for years to come.""

""The historic Green Economy Action Plan is the roadmap to an economy laser-focused on sustainability, resilience, and financial empowerment.

25,The Great Lockdown: Worst Economic Downturn Since the Great Depression - International Monetary Fund,The Great Lockdown: Worst Economic Downturn Since the Great Depression  International Monetary Fund,"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltZi5vcmcvZW4vQmxvZ3MvQXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyMC8wNC8xNC9ibG9nLXdlby10aGUtZ3JlYXQtbG9ja2Rvd24td29yc3QtZWNvbm9taWMtZG93bnR1cm4tc2luY2UtdGhlLWdyZWF0LWRlcHJlc3Npb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,International Monetary Fund,"As countries implement necessary quarantines and social distancing practices to contain the pandemic, the world has been put in a Great Lockdown. The magnitude and speed of collapse in activity that has followed is unlike anything experienced in our lifetimes.

April World Economic Outlook projects global growth in 2020 to fall to -3 percent.

This is a crisis like no other, and there is substantial uncertainty about its impact on people’s lives and livelihoods. A lot depends on the epidemiology of the virus, the effectiveness of containment measures, and the development of therapeutics and vaccines, all of which are hard to predict. In addition, many countries now face multiple crises—a health crisis, a financial crisis, and a collapse in commodity prices, which interact in complex ways. Policymakers are providing unprecedented support to households, firms, and financial markets, and, while this is crucial for a strong recovery, there is considerable uncertainty about what the economic landscape will look like when we emerge from this lockdown.

Under the assumption that the pandemic and required containment peaks in the second quarter for most countries in the world, and recedes in the second half of this year, in the April World Economic Outlook we project global growth in 2020 to fall to -3 percent. This is a downgrade of 6.3 percentage points from January 2020, a major revision over a very short period. This makes the Great Lockdown the worst recession since the Great Depression, and far worse than the Global Financial Crisis.

Assuming the pandemic fades in the second half of 2020 and that policy actions taken around the world are effective in preventing widespread firm bankruptcies, extended job losses, and system-wide financial strains, we project global growth in 2021 to rebound to 5.8 percent.

This recovery in 2021 is only partial as the level of economic activity is projected to remain below the level we had projected for 2021, before the virus hit. The cumulative loss to global GDP over 2020 and 2021 from the pandemic crisis could be around 9 trillion dollars, greater than the economies of Japan and Germany, combined.

This is a truly global crisis as no country is spared. Countries reliant on tourism, travel, hospitality, and entertainment for their growth are experiencing particularly large disruptions. Emerging market and developing economies face additional challenges with unprecedented reversals in capital flows as global risk appetite wanes, and currency pressures, while coping with weaker health systems, and more limited fiscal space to provide support. Moreover, several economies entered this crisis in a vulnerable state with sluggish growth and high debt levels.

For the first time since the Great Depression both advanced economies and emerging market and developing economies are in recession. For this year, growth in advanced economies is projected at -6.1 percent. Emerging market and developing economies with normal growth levels well above advanced economies are also projected to have negative growth rates of -1.0 percent in 2020, and -2.2 percent if you exclude China. Income per capita is projected to shrink for over 170 countries. Both advanced economies and emerging market and developing economies are expected to partially recover in 2021.

Alternative adverse scenarios

What I have described is a baseline scenario but, given the extreme uncertainty around the duration and intensity of the health crisis, we also explore alternative, more adverse scenarios. The pandemic may not recede in the second half of this year, leading to longer durations of containment, worsening financial conditions, and further breakdowns of global supply chains. In such cases, global GDP would fall even further: an additional 3 percent in 2020 if the pandemic is more protracted this year, while, if the pandemic continues into 2021, it may fall next year by an additional 8 percent compared to our baseline scenario.

Exceptional policy actions

Flattening the spread of COVID-19 using lockdowns allows health systems to cope with the disease, which then permits a resumption of economic activity. In this sense, there is no trade-off between saving lives and saving livelihoods. Countries should continue to spend generously on their health systems, perform widespread testing, and refrain from trade restrictions on medical supplies. A global effort must ensure that when therapies and vaccines are developed both rich and poor nations alike have immediate access.

While the economy is shut down, policymakers will need to ensure that people are able to meet their needs and that businesses can pick up once the acute phases of the pandemic pass. The large, timely, and targeted, fiscal, monetary, and financial policies already taken by many policymakers—including credit guarantees, liquidity facilities, loan forbearance, expanded unemployment insurance, enhanced benefits, and tax relief—have been lifelines to households and businesses. This support should continue throughout the containment phase to minimize persistent scars that could emerge from subdued investment and job losses in this severe downturn.

Policymakers must also plan for the recovery. As containment measures come off, policies should shift swiftly to supporting demand, incentivizing firm hiring, and repairing balance sheets in the private and public sector to aid the recovery. Fiscal stimulus that is coordinated across countries with fiscal space will magnify the benefit for all economies. Moratoria on debt repayments and debt restructuring may need to be continued during the recovery phase.

Multilateral cooperation is vital to the health of the global recovery. To support needed spending in developing countries, bilateral creditors and international financial institutions should provide concessional financing, grants, and debt relief. The activation and establishment of swap lines between major central banks has helped ease shortages in international liquidity, and may need to be expanded to more economies. Collaborative effort is needed to ensure that the world does not de-globalize, so the recovery is not damaged by further losses to productivity.

At the International Monetary Fund, we are actively deploying our 1-trillion-dollar lending capacity to support vulnerable countries, including through rapid-disbursing emergency financing and debt service relief to our poorest member countries, and we are calling on official bilateral creditors to do the same.

There are some hopeful signs that this health crisis will end. Countries are succeeding in containing the virus using social-distancing practices, testing, and contact tracing, at least for now, and treatments and vaccines may develop sooner than expected.

In the meantime, we face tremendous uncertainty around what comes next. Commensurate with the scale and speed of the crisis, domestic and international policy responses need to be large, rapidly deployed, and speedily recalibrated as new data becomes available. The courageous actions of doctors and nurses need to be matched by policymakers all over the world so we can jointly overcome this crisis.","(0, 'GDP')"
26,Policymakers Need Steady Hand as Storm Clouds Gather Over Global Economy - International Monetary Fund,Policymakers Need Steady Hand as Storm Clouds Gather Over Global Economy  International Monetary Fund,"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltZi5vcmcvZW4vQmxvZ3MvQXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyMi8xMC8xMS9wb2xpY3ltYWtlcnMtbmVlZC1zdGVhZHktaGFuZC1hcy1zdG9ybS1jbG91ZHMtZ2F0aGVyLW92ZXItZ2xvYmFsLWVjb25vbXnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,International Monetary Fund,"The global economy continues to face steep challenges, shaped by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a cost-of-living crisis caused by persistent and broadening inflation pressures, and the slowdown in China.

Our global growth forecast for this year is unchanged at 3.2 percent, while our projection for next year is lowered to 2.7 percent—0.2 percentage points lower than the July forecast. The 2023 slowdown will be broad-based, with countries accounting for about one-third of the global economy poised to contract this year or next. The three largest economies, the United States, China, and the euro area will continue to stall. Overall, this year’s shocks will re-open economic wounds that were only partially healed post-pandemic. In short, the worst is yet to come and, for many people, 2023 will feel like a recession.

In the United States, the tightening of monetary and financial conditions will slow growth to 1 percent next year. In China, we have lowered next year’s growth forecast to 4.4 percent due to a weakening property sector and continued lockdowns.

The slowdown is most pronounced in the euro area, where the energy crisis caused by the war will continue to take a heavy toll, reducing growth to 0.5 percent in 2023.

Almost everywhere, rapidly rising prices, especially of food and energy, are causing serious hardship for households, particularly for the poor.

Despite the economic slowdown, inflation pressures are proving broader and more persistent than anticipated. Global inflation is now expected to peak at 9.5 percent this year before decelerating to 4.1 percent by 2024. Inflation is also broadening well beyond food and energy. Global core inflation rose from an annualized monthly rate of 4.2 percent at end-2021 to 6.7 percent in July for the median country.

Downside risks to the outlook remain elevated, while policy trade-offs to address the cost-of-living crisis have become more challenging. Among the ones highlighted in our report:

The risk of monetary, fiscal, or financial policy miscalibration has risen sharply amid high uncertainty and growing fragilities.





Global financial conditions could deteriorate, and the dollar strengthen further, should turmoil in financial markets erupt, pushing investors towards safe assets. This would add significantly to inflation pressures and financial fragilities in the rest of the world, especially emerging markets and developing economies.





Inflation could, yet again, prove more persistent, especially if labor markets remain extremely tight.





Finally, the war in Ukraine is still raging and further escalation can exacerbate the energy crisis.

Our latest outlook also assesses the risks around our baseline projections. We estimate that there is about a one in four probability that global growth next year could fall below the historically low level of 2 percent. If many of the risks materialize, global growth would decline to 1.1 percent with quasi stagnant income-per-capita in 2023. According to our calculations, the likelihood of such an adverse outcome, or worse, is 10 percent to 15 percent.

Cost-of-living crisis

Increasing price pressures remain the most immediate threat to current and future prosperity by squeezing real incomes and undermining macroeconomic stability. Central banks are now laser-focused on restoring price stability, and the pace of tightening has accelerated sharply.

There are risks of both under- and over-tightening. Under-tightening would further entrench inflation, erode the credibility of central banks, and de-anchor inflation expectations. As history teaches us, this would only increase the eventual cost of bringing inflation under control.

Over-tightening risks pushing the global economy into an unnecessarily severe recession. Financial markets may also struggle with overly rapid tightening. Yet, the costs of these policy mistakes are not symmetric. The hard-won credibility of central banks could be undermined if they misjudge yet again the stubborn persistence of inflation. This would prove much more detrimental to future macroeconomic stability. Where necessary, financial policy should ensure that markets remain stable. However, central banks need to keep a steady hand with monetary policy firmly focused on taming inflation.

Formulating the appropriate fiscal response to the cost-of-living crisis has become a serious challenge. Let me mention a few key principles.

First, fiscal policy should not work at cross-purpose with monetary authorities’ efforts to bring down inflation. Doing so will only prolong inflation and could cause serious financial instability, as recent events illustrated.

Second, the energy crisis, especially in Europe, is not a transitory shock. The geopolitical realignment of energy supplies in the wake of the war is broad and permanent. Winter 2022 will be challenging, but winter 2023 will likely be worse. Price signals will be essential to curb energy demand and stimulate supply. Price controls, untargeted subsidies, or export bans are fiscally costly and lead to excess demand, undersupply, misallocation, and rationing. They rarely work. Fiscal policy should instead aim to protect the most vulnerable through targeted and temporary transfers.

Third, fiscal policy can help economies adapt to a more volatile environment by investing in productive capacity: human capital, digitalization, green energy, and supply chain diversification. Expanding these can make economies more resilient to future crises. Unfortunately, these important principles are not always guiding policy right now.

Effects of a strong dollar

For many emerging markets, the strength of the dollar is a major challenge. The dollar is now at its strongest since the early 2000s, although the appreciation is most pronounced against currencies of advanced economies. So far, the rise appears mostly driven by fundamental forces such as tightening US monetary policy and the energy crisis.

The appropriate response in most emerging and developing countries is to calibrate monetary policy to maintain price stability, while letting exchange rates adjust, conserving valuable foreign exchange reserves for when financial conditions really worsen.

As the global economy is headed for stormy waters, now is the time for emerging market policymakers to batten down the hatches.

Eligible countries with sound policies should urgently consider improving their liquidity buffers, including by requesting access to precautionary instruments from the Fund. Countries should also aim to minimize the impact of future financial turmoil through a combination of preemptive macroprudential and capital flow measures, where appropriate, in line with our Integrated Policy Framework .

Too many low-income countries are in or near debt distress. Progress toward orderly debt restructurings through the Group of Twenty’s Common Framework for the most affected is urgently needed to avert a wave of sovereign debt crisis. Time may soon run out.

The energy and food crises, coupled with extreme summer temperatures, are stark reminders of what an uncontrolled climate transition would look like. Progress on climate policies , as well as on debt resolution and other targeted multilateral issues, will prove that a focused multilateralism can, indeed, achieve progress for all and succeed in overcoming geoeconomic fragmentation pressures.","(0, 'GDP')"

عربي, 中文, Español, Français, 日本語, Português, Русский

While quarantining and social distancing is the right prescription to combat COVID-19’s public health impact, the exact opposite is needed when it comes to securing the global economy.

Constant contact and close coordination are the best medicine to ensure that the economic pain inflicted by the virus is relatively short-lived.

Many governments have already taken significant steps, with major measures being announced on a daily basis—including yesterday’s bold, coordinated moves on monetary policy.

But clearly, even more needs to be done. As the virus spreads, increased coordinated action will be key to boosting confidence and providing stability to the global economy.

The case for a coordinated and synchronized global fiscal stimulus is becoming stronger by the hour.

Today, the IMF published a set of policy recommendations that can help guide countries in the difficult days ahead.

What more needs to be done?

Three action areas for the global economy

First, fiscal. Additional fiscal stimulus will be necessary to prevent long-lasting economic damage.

Fiscal measures already announced are being deployed on a range of policies that immediately prioritize health spending and those in need. We know that comprehensive containment measures—combined with early monitoring—will slow the rate of infection and the spread of the virus.

Governments should continue and expand these efforts to reach the most-affected people and businesses—with policies including increased paid sick leave and targeted tax relief.

Beyond these positive individual country actions, as the virus spreads, the case for a coordinated and synchronized global fiscal stimulus is becoming stronger by the hour.

During the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), for example, fiscal stimulus by the G20 amounted to about 2 percent of GDP, or over $900 billion in today’s money, in 2009 alone. So, there is a lot more work to do.

Second, monetary policy. In advanced economies, central banks should continue to support demand and boost confidence by easing financial conditions and ensuring the flow of credit to the real economy. For example, the U.S. Federal Reserve just announced further interest rate cuts, asset purchases, forward guidance and a drop in reserve requirements.

Policy steps that we know have worked before—including during the GFC—are on the table. Yesterday, major central banks took decisive coordinated action to ease swap lines and thus lessen global financial market stresses.

Going forward, there may be a need for swap lines to emerging market economies.

As the Institute for International Finance said last week, investors have removed nearly $42 billion from emerging markets since the beginning of the crisis. This is the largest outflow they have ever recorded.

So central banks’ policy action in emerging-market and developing economies will need to balance the especially difficult challenge of addressing capital flow reversals and commodity shocks. In times of crisis such as at present, foreign exchange interventions and capital flow management measures can usefully complement interest rate and other monetary policy actions.

Third, the regulatory response. Financial system supervisors should aim to maintain the balance between preserving financial stability, maintaining banking system soundness and sustaining economic activity.

This crisis will stress test whether the changes made in the wake of the financial crisis will serve their purpose.

Banks should be encouraged to use flexibility in existing regulations, for example by using their capital and liquidity buffers, and undertake renegotiation of loan terms for stressed borrowers. Risk disclosure and clear communication of supervisory expectations will also be essential for markets to function properly in the period ahead.

All this work—from monetary to fiscal to regulatory—is most effective when done cooperatively.

Indeed, IMF staff research shows that changes in spending, for example, have a multiplier effect when countries act together.

What the IMF can do

The IMF stands ready to mobilize its $1 trillion lending capacity to help our membership. As a first line of defense, the Fund can deploy its flexible and rapid-disbursing emergency response toolkit to help countries with urgent balance-of-payment needs.

These instruments could provide in the order of $50 billion to emerging and developing economies. Up to $10 billion could be made available to our low-income members through our concessional financing facilities, which carry zero interest rates.

The Fund already has 40 ongoing arrangements—both disbursing and precautionary—with combined commitments of about $200 billion. In many cases, these arrangements can provide another vehicle for the rapid disbursement of crisis financing. We also have received interest from about 20 countries and will be following up with them in the coming days.

In addition, the Fund’s Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT) can help the poorest countries with immediate debt relief, which will free up vital resources for health spending, containment, and mitigation. In this regard, I commend United Kingdom’s recent pledge of $195 million, which means the CCRT now has about $400 million available for potential debt relief. Our aim, with the help of other donors, is to boost it to $1 billion.

In this way, the IMF can serve its 189 member countries and demonstrate the value of international cooperation. Because, in the end, our answers to this crisis will not come from one method, one region, or one country in isolation.

Only through sharing, coordination, and cooperation will we be able to stabilize the global economy and return it to full health.","(3, 'inflation')"
28,The $7 trillion boost to the US economy from immigration has downsides too - CNN,The $7 trillion boost to the US economy from immigration has downsides too  CNN,"Wed, 20 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wMy8yMC9lY29ub215L2Vjb25vbXktaW1taWdyYXRpb24tc3VyZ2UvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBRGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDMvMjAvZWNvbm9teS9lY29ub215LWltbWlncmF0aW9uLXN1cmdl?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,CNN,"New York CNN —

The US economy defied forecast after forecast predicting an imminent recession over the past two years. Instead, it grew beyond belief.

A boom in immigration was part of the recipe, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a “60 Minutes” interview on CBS last month.

But stricter measures could be coming to curb immigration after the Supreme Court announced Tuesday it is temporarily allowing Texas to enforce a controversial law that allows state officials to arrest and detain people they suspect of entering the country illegally. (A federal appeals court late Tuesday night put Texas’ controversial law back on hold.)

Congress is also resuming its fight on immigration this week against the backdrop of a looming partial government shutdown.

Republican lawmakers want more funds for securing the border. Democrats, meanwhile, want to give many migrants a faster path to citizenship.

Often absent from their bickering is the economic impact of immigration. At a time when a record number of migrants have crossed into the country, the economic implications carry even more weight. By and large, it’s difficult to make the case that higher rates of immigration are completely a win-win. But it’s equally difficult to make the case that it’s a lose-lose situation.

A $7 trillion boost to the economy

On the surface, the math is pretty simple.

“More workers means more output, and that in turn leads to additional tax revenue,” Phillip Swagel, director of the Congressional Budget Office, told reporters last month after the agency released a new report on the economic outlook. The report included a special section on immigration and its impact on the economy.

While not all migrants, such as children or the infirm, will or even can find jobs, a large portion of recent and future expected migrants are believed to be between 25 and 54 years old, the CBO report said. People in that age range are considered part of the prime-age working population.

Federal authorities encountered more than 2.5 million migrants crossing the US-Mexico border last year, according to Department of Homeland Security estimates. That contributed to net immigration of 3.3 million people into the US in 2023, well above the 900,000 annual average from 2010 to 2019, according to the CBO. The agency’s estimates consider both people with and without prior authorization to enter the US.

Because of immigration trends, the US is on pace to have 1.7 million more people in its pool of workers this year compared with what the CBO estimated last year. By 2033, the CBO now estimates that the pool will have 5.2 million workers more than it estimated last year.

As a result, the nation’s gross domestic product — a measure of an economy’s size — will grow by an additional $7 trillion over the next decade, the nonpartisan agency projects. Inflation-adjusted GDP is set to add 0.2 percentage points on average every year because of greater immigration.

The federal government will benefit from that growth, which will lift tax revenue collections by $1 trillion, according to the CBO.

A strain on state and local governments’ resources

Non-US citizens typically do not qualify for social welfare programs like Social Security and unemployment insurance. At the same time, migrants who are legally authorized to work in the US make contributions to the programs via payroll deductions.

But when it comes to programs like public education, where beneficiaries do not need to be citizens, the surge in immigration can have negative impacts at the state and local level.

That helps explain why refugees, asylum-seekers and their immediate families contributed an estimated net $37.5 billion to the federal government between 2005 and 2019, according to a report released last month by the Department of Health and Human Services. However, they cost state and local governments an estimated net of $21.4 billion, according to the report.

State and local governments incur higher costs because they fund the majority of public schools across the country, the report said.

Additionally, 21% of refugees and asylees received food assistance at some point during the 15-year period, compared with 15% of the overall US population, according to the report. Housing assistance rates had a similarly large difference between the migrant group and the overall US population.

An answer to labor shortages

The number of US job openings exceeds the number of unemployed people looking for work by more than 2 million, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

When the economy was reopening after the pandemic shut down businesses, the number of job openings per unemployed person was much higher than it is currently. That drove employers to increase wages but, as a result, contributed to higher inflation.

Immigrants have been playing a crucial role in easing those shortages, Tara Watson, director of the Center for Economic Security and Opportunity at the Brookings Institution, told CNN.

Immigrants are poised to become even more necessary in the US labor market as more baby boomers enter retirement and fertility rates decline, said Watson, who co-authored the book “The Border Within: The Economics of Immigration in an Age of Fear.”

Depressed wage growth

The CBO’s report said the increase in the population from immigration “will put downward pressure on average real wages in the near term.” Real wages are what people earn after accounting for inflation.

Part of the reason is immigrants tend to work in sectors that pay lower wages to begin with, which puts downward pressure on wages overall, the CBO notes.

After 2027, the agency predicts the trend will “partially reverse” as migrant workers acquire more advanced skills. But, on average, real wages will be lower by 2034 than they otherwise would have been if not for current immigration trends, the report projected.","(0, 'GDP')"

30,Five Things to Know about the Informal Economy - International Monetary Fund,Five Things to Know about the Informal Economy  International Monetary Fund,"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltZi5vcmcvZW4vTmV3cy9BcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIxLzA3LzI4L25hLTA3MjgyMS1maXZlLXRoaW5ncy10by1rbm93LWFib3V0LXRoZS1pbmZvcm1hbC1lY29ub2150gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,International Monetary Fund,"The informal economy is a global and pervasive phenomenon. Some 60 percent of the world’s population participates in the informal sector. Although mostly prevalent in emerging and developing economies, it is also an important part of advanced economies.

The informal economy consists of activities that have market value but are not formally registered. The informal economy embraces professions as diverse as minibus drivers in Africa, the market stands in Latin America, and the hawkers found at traffic lights all over the world. In advanced economies, examples can range from gig and construction workers, through domestic workers, to registered firms that engage in informal activities. The International Labor Organization estimates that about 2 billion workers, or over 60 percent of the world’s adult labor force, operate in the informal sector--at least part time. The informal economy is a global phenomenon, but there is great variation within and across countries. On average, it represents 35 percent of GDP in low- and middle- income countries versus 15 percent in advanced economies. Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa have the highest levels of informality, and Europe and East Asia are the regions with the lowest levels of informality.

The informal economy is difficult to measure. This is because activities within it cannot be directly observed, and for the most part, participants in the informal economy do not want to be accounted for. But it is important to try and measure the size of the informal economy because of its significance, and also because it employs some of the world’s most vulnerable people. Informality can be measured in two different ways. The direct approach is based on surveys, voluntary replies, and other compliance methods to directly measure the number of informal workers and firms. Indirect methods focus on certain characteristics, or proxies, that can be observed and are related to informal economic activity. Examples of proxies include electricity consumption, night-light satellite data, and cash in circulation. Using these methods, the share of the informal economy in total output can be measured.

The COVID-19 pandemic hit informal workers particularly hard, especially women. This uneven impact of the pandemic is because the majority of informal workers are employed in contact-intensive sectors (such as domestic workers, market vendors, and taxi drivers) and in insecure jobs that do not offer paid leave or the ability to work from home. Close to 95 million more people—many of them informal workers--are estimated to have fallen below the threshold of extreme poverty in 2020 compared with pre-pandemic projections. Gender inequality is also increasing as millions of women who are informal workers, have been forced to stop working since the start of the pandemic. For example, women make up 80 percent of domestic workers globally, and 72 percent of them have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. In sub-Saharan Africa, 41 percent of women-owned businesses closed, compared with 34 percent of those owned by men.

The informal economy is central to the economic development process. Understanding the drivers and consequences of informality is central to sustainable and inclusive development, as informality is critically related to how fast countries grow, and to poverty and inequality, including gender inequality. Whereas some individuals and firms operate informally by choice, 85 percent of all informal workers are in precarious employment, not through choice but due to a lack of opportunities in the formal sector. This has important economic consequences. First, countries with large informal sectors tend to grow below their potential. Informal firms tend to remain small, with low productivity and limited access to finance. Also, they do not contribute to the tax base, depriving governments of resources to provide basic services to their populations. Second, informal workers are more likely to be poor and to earn lower wages compared to their peers in the formal sector. They lack social protection, access to credit and are generally less educated. Third, informality is related to gender inequality. Globally, 58 per cent of employed women work in the informal sector, and are more likely to be in the most precarious and low-paid categories of informal employment. In sub-Saharan Africa, women’s average share of informal employment in the region’s nonagricultural sector is 83 percent,","(0, 'GDP')"

As the health and human toll grows, the economic damage is already evident and represents the largest economic shock the world has experienced in decades.

The June 2020 Global Economic Prospects describes both the immediate and near-term outlook for the impact of the pandemic and the long-term damage it has dealt to prospects for growth. The baseline forecast envisions a 5.2 percent contraction in global GDP in 2020, using market exchange rate weights—the deepest global recession in decades, despite the extraordinary efforts of governments to counter the downturn with fiscal and monetary policy support. Over the longer horizon, the deep recessions triggered by the pandemic are expected to leave lasting scars through lower investment, an erosion of human capital through lost work and schooling, and fragmentation of global trade and supply linkages.

The crisis highlights the need for urgent action to cushion the pandemic’s health and economic consequences, protect vulnerable populations, and set the stage for a lasting recovery. For emerging market and developing countries, many of which face daunting vulnerabilities, it is critical to strengthen public health systems, address the challenges posed by informality, and implement reforms that will support strong and sustainable growth once the health crisis abates.

Historic contraction of per capita income

The pandemic is expected to plunge most countries into recession in 2020, with per capita income contracting in the largest fraction of countries globally since 1870. Advanced economies are projected to shrink 7 percent. That weakness will spill over to the outlook for emerging market and developing economies, who are forecast to contract by 2.5 percent as they cope with their own domestic outbreaks of the virus. This would represent the weakest showing by this group of economies in at least sixty years.","(0, 'GDP')"
33,Strengthen Central Bank Independence to Protect the World Economy - International Monetary Fund,Strengthen Central Bank Independence to Protect the World Economy  International Monetary Fund,"Thu, 21 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltZi5vcmcvZW4vQmxvZ3MvQXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyNC8wMy8yMS9zdHJlbmd0aGVuLWNlbnRyYWwtYmFuay1pbmRlcGVuZGVuY2UtdG8tcHJvdGVjdC10aGUtd29ybGQtZWNvbm9tedIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,International Monetary Fund,"Central bankers today face many challenges to their independence. Calls are growing for interest-rate cuts, even if premature, and are likely to intensify as half the world’s population votes this year. Risks of political interference in banks' decision making and personnel appointments are rising. Governments and central bankers must resist these pressures.

But why does this matter? Just consider what independent central banks have achieved in recent years. Central bankers steered effectively through the pandemic, unleashing aggressive monetary easing that helped prevent a global financial meltdown and speed recovery.

As the focus shifted to restoring price stability, central bankers appropriately tightened monetary policy—albeit on different timelines. Their response helped to keep inflation expectations anchored in most countries even as price increases reached multi-decade highs. Emerging markets were leaders in tightening early and forcefully, enhancing their credibility.

These central bank actions have brought inflation down to much more manageable levels and reduced the risks of a hard landing. While the battle isn’t yet over, their success thus far has largely been because of the independence and credibility that many central banks have built up in recent decades.

The recent success in bringing down inflation contrasts sharply to the economic instability that prevailed during the high inflation period of the 1970s. Back then, central banks didn’t have clear mandates to prioritize price stability, or clear laws protecting their autonomy. As a result, they were often pressured by politicians to lower interest rates when inflation was high.

Everyone was hurt by this high inflation, boom and bust era—especially people living on fixed incomes who saw their real incomes and savings eroded. Success in reducing inflation only came in the mid-1980s when central banks were given political support to aggressively fight inflation.

Measuring impact

Extensive research, including our own, demonstrates the critical importance of central bank independence.

One IMF study, looking at dozens of central banks from 2007 to 2021, shows that those with strong independence scores were more successful in keeping people’s inflation expectations in check, which helps keep inflation low. Independence is critical, and has become more predominant among countries at every income level.

Another IMF study tracking 17 Latin American central banks over the past 100 years examines factors including: decision-making independence, clarity of mandate, and whether they could be forced to lend to the government. It also found that greater independence was associated with much better inflation outcomes.

The bottom line is clear: central bank independence matters for price stability—and price stability matters for consistent long-term growth.

But to wield enormous power in democratic societies, trust is key. Central banks must earn that trust every day—through strong governance, transparency, and accountability, and delivering on core responsibilities.

Strong governance helps ensure that monetary policy is predictable and based on achieving mandated long-term goals, rather than short-term political gains. It starts with a clear legislative mandate that sets price stability as the main objective.

Even if employment is put on the same pedestal—as with the US Federal Reserve’s dual mandate—legislators have recognized that price stability aids macroeconomic stability, which ultimately supports employment.

Strong governance and independence mean central bankers should have control of their budgets and personnel, and not be subject to easy dismissal based on their policy views or actions taken within the legal mandate.

In exchange, they must be accountable, and they should be transparent.

They should regularly explain how their actions seek to advance their legislatively mandated goals, both in detailed reports and through testimony before lawmakers. Because central bank decisions profoundly affect everyone, central banks and governments should continue working to raise economic literacy so the people can be part of the policy conversation.

And trust ultimately depends on their success in delivering price stability, and ensuring the financial system remains stable.

Respecting independence

Other branches of government have clear responsibilities in helping central bankers achieve their mandated objectives and navigate hazards ahead. This includes not only laws proclaiming independence, but also following the letter and spirit of such laws.

It also means taking into account how other policy actions impact the job of central bankers.

Enacting prudent fiscal policies that keep debt sustainable helps to reduce the risk of “fiscal dominance”—pressure on the central bank to provide low-cost financing to the government, which ultimately stokes inflation. Fiscal prudence also provides more budget space to support the economy when needed, bolstering economic stability.

Another government responsibility that is often shared with central banks: maintaining a strong and well-regulated financial system.

Financial stability benefits the whole economy and reduces the risk that the central bank becomes reluctant to raise interest rates for fear of causing a financial meltdown. Actions to strengthen financial institutions since the global financial crisis, including in emerging markets, allowed central banks to raise rates sharply without undermining the financial system. This major achievement must be preserved.

When central banks and governments each play their roles, we have seen better control of inflation, better outcomes in growth and employment, and lower financial stability risks.

The IMF is here to help policymakers face these challenges. We strongly support central bank independence, providing tailored technical assistance to members working to improve governance and legal frameworks. We make independence an explicit pillar in some Fund-supported financing programs, agreeing with members on actions to measure and achieve it.

To strengthen this work, we introduced a new way to measure independence based on which aspects of it matter most, according to our recent survey of central banks.

And to increase accountability, we have developed a transparency code that helps central banks assess and improve their practices.

By working together—central bankers and government leaders, legislatures, and the people—we can preserve and strengthen central banks to win the fight against inflation today and foster economic stability and growth for years to come.

This will benefit everyone—the retiree living on a fixed income; the small entrepreneur trying to build her business; and every society that could face unrest when inflation gets out of control.

With such high stakes, we must preserve and strengthen central bank independence.","(3, 'inflation')"

The global economy begins the final descent toward a soft landing, with inflation declining steadily and growth holding up. But the pace of expansion remains slow, and turbulence may lie ahead.

Global activity proved resilient in the second half of last year, as demand and supply factors supported major economies. On the demand side, stronger private and government spending sustained activity, despite tight monetary conditions. On the supply side, increased labor force participation, mended supply chains and cheaper energy and commodity prices helped, despite renewed geopolitical uncertainties.

This resilience will carry over. Global growth under our baseline forecast will steady at 3.1 percent this year, a 0.2 percentage point upgrade from our October projections, before edging up to 3.2 percent next year.

Important divergences remain. We expect slower growth in the United States, where tight monetary policy is still working through the economy, and in China, where weaker consumption and investment continue to weigh on activity. In the euro area, meanwhile, activity is expected to rebound slightly after a challenging 2023, when high energy prices and tight monetary policy restricted demand. Many other economies continue to show great resilience, with growth accelerating in Brazil, India, and Southeast Asia’s major economies.

Inflation continues to ease. Excluding Argentina, global headline inflation will decline to 4.9 percent this year, down 0.4 percentage point from our October projection (also excluding Argentina). Core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, is also trending lower. For advanced economies, headline and core inflation will average around 2.6 percent this year, close to central banks’ inflation targets.

With the improved outlook, risks have moderated and are balanced. On the upside:

Disinflation could happen faster than anticipated, especially if labor market tightness eases further and short-term inflation expectations continue to decline, allowing central banks to ease sooner.

Fiscal consolidation measures that governments have announced for 2024-25 may be delayed as many countries face rising calls for increased public spending in what is the biggest global election year in history. This could boost economic activity, but also spur inflation and increase the prospect of disruption later.

Looking further ahead, rapid improvement in Artificial Intelligence could boost investment and spur rapid productivity growth, albeit one with significant challenges for workers.

On the downside:

New commodity and supply disruptions could occur, following renewed geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East. Shipping costs between Asia and Europe have increased markedly, as Red Sea attacks reroute cargoes around Africa. While disruptions remain limited so far, the situation remains volatile.

Core inflation could prove more persistent. The price of goods remains historically elevated relative to that of services. The adjustment could take the form of more persistent services—and overall—inflation. Wage developments, particularly in the euro area, where negotiated wages are still on the rise, could add to price pressures.

Markets appear excessively optimistic about the prospects for early rate cuts. Should investors re-assess their view, long-term interest rates would increase, putting renewed pressure on governments to implement more rapid fiscal consolidation that could weigh on economic growth.

Policy challenges

With inflation receding and growth remaining steady, it is now time to take stock and look ahead. Our analysis shows that a substantial share of recent disinflation occurred via a decline in commodity and energy prices, rather than through a contraction of economic activity.

Since monetary tightening typically works by depressing economic activity, a relevant question is what role, if any, has monetary policy played? The answer is that it worked through two additional channels. First, the rapid pace of tightening helped convince people and companies that high inflation would not be allowed to take hold. This prevented inflation expectations from persistently rising, helped dampen wage growth, and reduced the risk of a wage-price spiral. Second, the unusually synchronized nature of the tightening lowered world energy demand, directly reducing headline inflation.

But uncertainties remain and central banks now face two-sided risks. They must avoid premature easing that would undo many hard-earned credibility gains and lead to a rebound in inflation. But signs of strain are growing in interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as construction, and loan activity has declined markedly. It will be equally important to pivot toward monetary normalization in time, as several emerging markets where inflation is well on the way down have started doing so already. Not doing so would jeopardize growth and risk inflation falling below target.

My sense is that the United States, where inflation appears more demand-driven, needs to focus on risks in the first category, while the euro area, where the surge in energy prices has played a disproportionate role, needs to manage more the second risk. In both cases, staying on the path toward a soft landing may not be easy.

The biggest challenge ahead of us is to tackle elevated fiscal risks. Most countries came out of the pandemic and energy crisis with higher public debt levels and borrowing costs. Bringing down public debt and deficits will give space to deal with future shocks.

Remaining fiscal measures introduced to offset high energy prices should be phased out right away, as the energy crisis is behind us. But more is needed. The danger is two-fold. The most pressing risk is that countries do too little. Fiscal fragilities will build up until the risk of a fiscal crisis forces sudden and disruptive adjustments, at great cost. The other risk, already relevant for some countries, is to do too much, too soon, in the hope of convincing markets of ones’ fiscal rectitude. This could endanger growth prospects. It would also make it much harder to address imminent fiscal challenges such as the climate transition.

What to do then? The answer is to implement a steady fiscal consolidation, with a non-trivial first installment. Promises of future adjustment alone will not do. This first installment should be combined with an improved and well-enforced fiscal framework, so future consolidation efforts are both sizable and credible. As monetary policy starts to ease and growth resumes, it should become easier to do more. The opportunity should not be wasted.

Emerging markets have been very resilient, with stronger-than-expected growth and stable external balances, partly due to improved monetary and fiscal frameworks. Yet divergence in policy between countries may spur capital outflows and currency volatility. This calls for stronger buffers, in line with our Integrated Policy Framework.

Beyond fiscal consolidation, the focus should return to medium-term growth. We project global growth of 3.2 percent next year, still well below the historical average. A faster pace is needed to address the world’s many structural challenges: the climate transition, sustainable development, and raising living standards.

Reforms that ease the most binding constraints to economic activity, such as governance, business regulation and external sector reform, can help unleash latent productivity gains, our research shows. Stronger growth could also come from limiting geoeconomic fragmentation by, for instance, removing the trade barriers that are impeding trade flows between different geopolitical blocs, including in low-carbon technology products that are crucially needed by emerging and developing countries.

Instead, we should strive to keep our economies more interconnected. Only by doing so can we work together on shared priorities. Multilateral cooperation remains the best approach to address global challenges. Progress toward that, such as the recent 50 percent increase of the Fund’s permanent resources, is welcome.","(0, 'GDP')"

Ukraine’s central bank governor speaks to Country Focus about the challenges of maintaining economic and financial stability

Russia’s invasion has inflicted terrible human and economic suffering on Ukraine and the country faces a winter of air strikes and rocket attacks against critical infrastructure. This week the IMF’s management approved Ukraine’s request for Program Monitoring with Board Involvement—the first arrangement of its kind—to maintain economic stability and catalyze donor financing.

Andriy Pyshnyy, Governor of the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), spoke to Country Focus in Washington about the economic impact of Russia’s invasion, the challenges of maintaining banking and financial stability at a time of war, his expectations for the IMF monitoring program, moves to revive local debt markets and relax crisis controls, and how impaired hearing has affected him.

It has been almost 10 months since Russia invaded Ukraine. What has been the impact on Ukraine’s economy and how has society remained resilient?

For the past 10 months, Ukraine has withstood the largest full-scale military aggression in Europe since World War II. Ukrainians have demonstrated fantastic resilience. The impact of the war is hard even to comprehend. According to our estimates, Ukraine will lose at least one-third of its GDP in 2022. During the first few weeks, the war was practically everywhere, either through active ground operations or air strikes. It was a very hard period. However, the Ukrainian people and businesses soon started to recover from the first shock of the full-scale war. Some displaced people came back. The Ukrainian economy adjusted to the war. New sectors of the economy were created that focused on supporting Ukraine’s armed forces.

The banking system was strong and operated with no functional limitations during the whole war, regardless of very big ground and air operations. We stopped the outflow of capital, implemented a fixed exchange rate, and took several other necessary anti-crisis measures. And almost all banks—not only systematically important banks—continued operations. This is a big advantage for Ukraine. Thanks to this, there is financing and payments support for the economy, which remains fully operational. We have income from taxes, we make social-security payments, we have international assistance, and we can fundraise billions of hryvnias to support the armed forces.

Ukrainians have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to withstand the enemy but also to adapt to a new environment.

You have been in your post as governor for 10 weeks. What were the challenges of taking over in the midst of war and how have you kept the banking and financial sectors functioning?

Since October, Ukraine has been under intensified energy terror. There were nine waves of rocket or missile attacks that destroyed our critical infrastructure—key facilities that generate and distribute electricity, heating, and water. This is conscious energy terror: to make Ukrainians suffer in cold and darkness. These waves of attack occurred during my period at the NBU. Our efforts are focused on making sure that the banking network continues to operate.

Right now, the most critical project is power banking. This includes the creation of one network of branches of systematically important banks in Ukraine. We are talking about over 1,000 branches in 200 cities and villages. These branches are expected to function as one network. We are developing operational solutions to support this network, even under blackout conditions, with backup electricity, connectivity, and cash. Nothing comparable has ever been implemented anywhere in the world.

At the same time, Ukraine has created special stations where Ukrainians can come when there is no electricity, to charge their phones, get warm and receive hot meals. We will provide banking systems, including ATMs, in these stations organized in government buildings and special shelters. We are working with a big network of stores and gas stations to make sure that the citizens of Ukraine have access to cash when they need it.

The next priority will be an assessment of banks in Ukraine through diagnostics and stress tests. The banking systems came into this war in a very good stance as a result of reforms implemented with technical assistance from the IMF and other international institutions. As the Ukrainian economy and banking system recovers, I believe it is important for us to review the restrictions that were implemented during the crisis period. Right now, the Ukrainian banking system is functioning with some administrative restrictions, for example on capital flows. This was something we had to do to ensure macroeconomic stability. As the economy recovers, we will review all these processes and go back to market mechanisms.

Ukraine and the IMF recently concluded a “Program Monitoring with Board Involvement” or PMB. How do you expect this to benefit Ukraine?

The monitoring program is an important step that allows Ukraine to demonstrate its aspiration and readiness for reforms, regardless of the war. This will be also an opportunity to coordinate fiscal, monetary, and other policies, and facilitate interactions between the NBU as the institution with the mandate to ensure price and financial stability, and the Ministry of Finance, which has the mandate to seek necessary financing of the war.

Ukraine understands how important it is to use all the potential of the domestic debt market and achieve the important strategic task of financing for the FY2023 budget. We have to finance colossal budget needs of least $38 billion with external funds. We coordinated with the Ministry of Finance and agreed that the financing of next year’s deficit will not be done by the central bank, as this would create additional risks and challenges for macroeconomic stability. Even though we need a record amount of money, the Government of Ukraine, the Ministry of Finance and the NBU plan to finance the budget through cooperation with the donor coalition and the domestic debt market as well as with the assistance from the IMF.

We believe that the monitoring program will be one of the key elements that will allow Ukraine to attract financing from the coalition of international partners. They will look for a green light from the IMF. At the same time, we hope it will be the first step to an upper-credit tranche program that Ukraine is counting on next Spring.

We are grateful to the IMF team for their intense and professional work during these past two very challenging months. There was continuous communication, 24/7. The two parties held conferences night and day. We finalized our agreement during a missile attack. This added significance to each word that was spoken and each decision that was made.

Some years ago you started to lose your hearing and you have since become an advocate for the rights of people in Ukraine with impaired hearing. Have you been able to turn your loss of hearing into an advantage?

The loss of any ability cannot be considered an advantage, but at the same time it can open some new parts of one’s personality. In my case, I think it has allowed me to strengthen my focus and concentration. I do not hear external or ambient noise—nothing distracts me literally or figuratively.

Central banks have a notion of monetary silence. The bank and its entire staff are quiet with external parties the week before the meeting of the monetary policy decision-making committee to listen to each other attentively, to concentrate on the most important issues, and not to make mistakes in key decisions. So, in my case, this absence of noise allows me to get into that regime of monetary silence when it is necessary and focus on the most important issue.

Like many countries, Thailand’s economy was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic last year. The country’s GDP fell by over 6 percent in 2020 and many workers, especially those related to the tourism sector, lost their jobs.

or Article IV consultation IMF’s latest annual assessment or Article IV consultation, Thailand’s economy is forecast to grow at 2.6 percent in 2021, and a surge in COVID‑19 infections in the country and the region since the beginning of the year highlights the uncertainty about the path of the pandemic and the importance of continued efforts to contain the spread of the virus for a strong and durable recovery. , Thailand’s economy is forecast to grow at 2.6 percent in 2021, and a surge in COVID‑19 infections in the country and the region since the beginning of the year highlights the uncertainty about the path of the pandemic and the importance of continued efforts to contain the spread of the virus for a strong and durable recovery. Here are five things to know about Thailand’s recent economic challenges and prospects for the recovery: The pandemic precipitated a sudden stop in tourism flows and a significant contraction in economic activity. Thailand’s GDP fell by 6.1 percent in 2020, the largest contraction since the Asian financial crisis. The tourism sector, which accounts for about a fifth of GDP and 20 percent of employment, has been especially affected by the cessation of tourist travel. Low-skilled workers and informal and migrant workers have been hit hard, particularly women and the youth, who have suffered disproportionately from diminished employment opportunities in contact-intensive sectors bearing a significant burden of the layoffs observed in 2020. The financial sector has thus far weathered the pandemic well, but stress has been building up in the small and medium enterprises sector.



Thailand’s GDP fell by 6.1 percent in 2020, the largest contraction since the Asian financial crisis.

Low-skilled workers and informal and migrant workers have been hit hard, particularly women and the youth, who have suffered disproportionately from diminished employment opportunities in contact-intensive sectors bearing a significant burden of the layoffs observed in 2020. The financial sector has thus far weathered the pandemic well, but stress has been building up in the small and medium enterprises sector. The government responded boldly to mitigate the crisis. Timely and stringent containment measures introduced by the authorities successfully flattened the infection curve during most of 2020. Effective containment, along with a timely and multipronged policy package—comprising fiscal stimulus amounting to about 10 percent of GDP; cuts in the policy rate by 75 basis points to its all time low of 0.5 percent, and financial sector measures to buttress the smooth functioning of financial markets and support debtors affected by COVID 19—helped limit the impact. The fiscal support has included health-related spending and assistance to affected households, including those outside the social security system financed by some reprioritization in the fiscal year 2020 budget and an additional borrowing of 1 trillion baht. These measures have saved lives and livelihoods and in part supported an initial recovery by restoring confidence and permitting a pathway to a safe and gradual reopening of activity. However, the fiscal deficit widened to 4.8 percent of GDP in 2020 and public debt-to-GDP ratio increased to 49.6 percent of GDP in 2020 from 41 percent in 2019.

Dark clouds persist and require flexibility in government policies to build back better and stronger. Economic recovery in 2021 is expected to be sluggish, with growth projected at 2.6 percent in the recently completed 2021 Article IV consultation, and divergent across sectors. Prospects for a near-term recovery are challenged by an aggressive third wave of the pandemic. This environment calls for flexibility and careful coordination among the fiscal, monetary and financial sector policies to adapt to fast changing circumstances. Most important to a resilient recovery at this juncture is the vaccine policy. Accelerating and ensuring adequate distribution of vaccines is critical to attain herd immunity, put an end to the pandemic and lay the groundwork for a strong recovery.

Most important to a resilient recovery at this juncture is the vaccine policy. Accelerating and ensuring adequate distribution of vaccines is critical to attain herd immunity, put an end to the pandemic and lay the groundwork for a strong recovery. Mutually reinforcing policies are needed to support the recovery with fiscal policy at the center of the policy response. A premature withdrawal of the support measures would not be prudent before a recovery is well underway. To help accelerate the recovery, a more ambitious fiscal expansion is warranted with spending focused on scaling up of public investment and protecting the vulnerable, including through better targeted social transfers. As the crisis subsides and the recovery strengthens, Thailand will need to initiate a medium-term revenue mobilization strategy to rebuild fiscal buffers and ensure fiscal sustainability. Rebuilding fiscal buffers after the pandemic will require additional effort in both revenue generation and expenditure prioritization. Targeted and more effective financial sector support to hard hit firms and households, complemented with additional monetary accommodation, would also support the recovery.

Thailand’s dependence on contact-intensive sectors and long-standing structural issues, such as high informality—evident before the pandemic—warrant a strong push to adapt the economy to the post-pandemic world. Further scaling up of investment, particularly for digital infrastructure, combined with improving training and education outcomes and promoting innovation will catalyze the economy’s digital transformation and mitigate the possible long‑term economic damage from the pandemic. The authorities see the crisis as an opportunity to transform the tourism sector from mass and low‑cost to high‑end and low-density tourism, while encouraging domestic tourism, to reduce the sector’s dependence on tourism‑related infrastructure and natural resources. To facilitate a safe reopening for the tourism sector, Thailand added tourism employees as essential workers in the vaccination queue and plans to reopen to international tourists from July 1, under the ""Phuket Sandbox"" initiative, allowing free movement of fully vaccinated tourists on the island. The COVID‑19 crisis also offers an opportunity to better align development policies with climate objectives to strengthen the recovery and economic resilience, and place Thailand on a firm path to meeting climate mitigation goals. An efficient carbon pricing would encourage a gradual shift to cleaner energy alternatives, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, and help in transitioning to a decarbonized economy.

These episodes have also lifted uncertainty to exceptionally high levels, which in turn hurts economic growth as our research shows.

To better track the evolution of these conditions, we updated our World Uncertainty Index to show more frequent readings that are monthly, instead of quarterly, and incorporate data for 71 economies dating back to 2008.

As the Chart of the Week shows, the index fell in December, the most recent reading, but has continued to hit elevated levels in recent times on the back of successive shocks, including most recently Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the associated cost-of-living crisis.

Our approach uses a text analysis of reports by the Economist Intelligence Unit that allows us to classify the sources of uncertainty by analyzing which words have been published in close proximity to mentions of uncertainty. We believe it’s the first effort to construct a text-based monthly measure of uncertainty covering many developing countries and being comparable across countries.

The interactive chart’s second slide breaks down the composition of uncertainty mentions linked to trade, the pandemic, spillovers from major economies, and Russia’s war in Ukraine.

This shows how the drivers have evolved. Uncertainty jumped following the United Kingdom’s unexpected vote to leave the European Union—and soared even further after the surprise outcome of the 2016 presidential election in the United States. This was followed by US trade tensions with China, which caused major uncertainty for the world.

Another big spike followed in early 2020 with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, followed less than two years later by another shock from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and renewed trade uncertainty associated with the risk of geoeconomic fragmentation.","(3, 'inflation')"

Blueprint Outlines “New New York” Blue-Ribbon Panel to Re-envision Central Business Districts, Lays Foundation for City’s Economic Future, With Investments in Small Businesses and Emerging Industries

NEW YORK – New York City Mayor Eric Adams today released “Rebuild, Renew, Reinvent: A Blueprint for New York City’s Economic Recovery,” which outlines the mayor’s vision for the city’s economic recovery and the future of the city’s economy — all built on equity and inclusivity. The COVID-19 global pandemic devastated the city’s economy, but New York City is now on the cusp of an economic resurgence, and the mayor’s plan seizes on a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reinvigorate the city’s economy in the short and long terms. The blueprint specifically aims to accelerate the return to pre-pandemic employment levels, while simultaneously laying the foundation for the city’s economic future — addressing historic injustices and reimagining outdated ways of doing business.

“New York City’s recovery cannot and will not be about going back to the way things were — we are going to rebuild, renew, and reinvent our city and our economy for today, tomorrow, and generations to come,” said Mayor Adams. “This is more than a to-do list: It is a complete reset with more than 70 concrete actions we will take to tear down the barriers to progress and build up a strong, resilient city with opportunity for everyone. I want all New Yorkers to know that your city is looking out for you and planning for your future, so New York can be a city we are all proud to call home.”

""Our state’s economy has been battered over these last two years, but there is no doubt New York's best days lie ahead,” said New York State Governor Kathy Hochul. “We will seize this moment to do what New Yorkers always have done: To stay strong and work together to find new, innovative paths to growth that build upon our strengths. My administration has begun this work by advancing new investments that include a renewed commitment to workforce development, the largest state-sponsored tourism package in the country, and a historic $500 million commitment to expanding the offshore wind industry in New York State. This work sets a strong foundation, but we can and will do much more. Mayor Adams and I are committed to working together and with the private sector to plan for a future that uplifts us all. The New New York Panel is a demonstration of our unwavering resolve. Let’s get to work.”

“Our mission is to provide opportunity to every New Yorker,” said Deputy Mayor for Economic and Workforce Development Maria Torres-Springer. “We have weathered considerable struggle and loss over the last two years. But there has never been a more urgent time for New York to serve as a model for equitable recovery, and the investments and initiatives in this blueprint will accelerate our city’s return, help us return to pre-pandemic employment levels more quickly, and build our city back more inclusively than ever.”

The plan to accelerate the city’s recovery and build a more resilient economy rests on five key pillars:

Restarting our city’s economic engines and reactivating the public realm; Supporting small businesses, entrepreneurship, and a more equitable economy; Driving inclusive sector growth and building a future-focused economy; Connecting New Yorkers to quality jobs and in-demand skills; and Planning and building for inclusive growth now and in the future.

While this moment in the city’s post-COVID economic recovery holds great potential, significant challenges continue to face parts of the city. More than 26,000 businesses have closed, while many offices remain shuttered; unemployment among Black New Yorkers remains more than three times the national average at 15 percent; and tourism remains far below pre-pandemic levels, depriving the city of much-needed economic activity.

Tackling these challenges will require a comprehensive, collaborative effort bringing together the business community, labor unions, neighborhood advocates, faith leaders, educators, and New Yorkers across the five boroughs. Mayor Adams’ blueprint represents the first stage of that effort.

Among the strategies outlined in the blueprint are more than 70 concrete actions that will help realize the mayor’s goal of rebuilding, renewing, and reimagining the city’s economy. The administration will:

The economic recovery blueprint arrives as the city enters a new phase in its COVID-19 response, beginning withMayor Adams’ decision last week to suspend Key to NYC and remove mask mandates for K-12 public school students. The blueprint also follows the release of Mayor Adams’Subway Safety Plan last month and his Blueprint to End Gun Violence in January.

“As New York City restarts its economy, the mayor’s Blueprint for Economic Recovery offers a strong vision to help meet the challenges that lie ahead,” said First Deputy Mayor Lorraine Grillo. “As we recover, the blueprint will accelerate the city’s economic engine now and into the future.”

“The Adams economic blueprint is a clear, common-sense, and creative path to revitalize and grow our city’s greatest asset — our public realm — bring infrastructure equity to all New Yorkers, and build a resilient and forward-facing economy, workforce, and city,” said Deputy Mayor for Operations Meera Joshi. “Armed with this roadmap, there is no better time to be a New Yorker.”

“This plan sets forth a hopeful path to support the resiliency and ingenuity in every person,” said Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Anne Williams-Isom. “From our health care sector to green jobs, this plan is about an economic recovery that supports every family, every child, and every New Yorker. There is so much to do, from high unemployment to pay equity across the city, and I look forward to working with all of our partners to make our city ever stronger and more equitable.”

“The Blueprint for New York City’s Economic Recovery is a massive step forward in the right direction for our city,” said Deputy Mayor for Strategic Initiatives Sheena Wright. “Not only are we casting a vision for a more prosperous city, but we’re outlining the action steps to restart our economy in an equitable, strategic, and future-focused way. By rolling up our sleeves and working together, we will rebuild, renew, and reinvent the economic recovery of our city.”

“Our housing needs and our city’s economy are closely tied together,” said Chief Housing Officer Jessica Katz. “Today’s announcement is an important step in building a stronger, more equitable New York, which will help us tackle our critical housing shortage. I’m excited to work with the team as we implement these vital programs and policies.”

“New York City is at the dawn of a new chapter in our history,” said Chief Efficiency Officer Melanie La Rocca. “I’m thankful to Mayor Adams and Deputy Mayor Torres-Springer for their clear vision to revitalize, reimage, and remake our city in a more efficient and effective way.”

“Under Mayor Adams’ administration, New York City is leveraging technology daily to bridge the longstanding digital divide and create opportunities to expand and support the city’s workforce,” said Chief Technology Officer Matthew Fraser. “This economic blueprint is a key component to our city’s recovery and represents a fresh vision that will usher our city into a new generation of prosperity and innovation. I thank Mayor Adams for his leadership and tireless commitment to ‘Get Stuff Done’ for New Yorkers.”

“I applaud Mayor Adams and Deputy Mayor Torres-Springer for taking these bold steps to drive our economic recovery forward with a plan centered on equity and economic mobility as well as public-private partnership,” said Andrew Kimball, president and CEO, New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC). “This blueprint will make New York stronger and more resilient than ever, and we at NYCEDC are proud to work with our partners in the private sector, in government, and in communities across the city to execute on its vision.”

“We know that we owe a great deal to the people who powered this city through the pandemic — the frontline workers, the small business owners, and the community nonprofits,” said Department of Small Business Services Commissioner Kevin D. Kim. “The exciting initiatives announced today will provide the critical support they need to succeed and thrive. Today, we are putting equity at the forefront of economic development, because we want to make sure that all New Yorkers can share in our prosperity.”

“As we emerge from the pandemic, we need to take every possible step to jumpstart our local economy,” said Department of City Planning Director and City Planning Commission Chair Dan Garodnick. “With this blueprint, we have a strategy that will allow us to deliver equitable growth across all five boroughs. This will include new housing, more accessible jobs, and greener, more resilient neighborhoods. We stand shoulder to shoulder with Mayor Adams in support of this plan to deliver a better, brighter, and fairer future for all New Yorkers.”

“New York City’s economic recovery will not only be strong; it will be equitable,” said Department of Consumer and Worker Protection Commissioner Vilda Vera Mayuga. “Our mission is to protect consumers and workers while supporting businesses, and this economic recovery blueprint succeeds in doing all three. Thanks to Mayor Adams, we are connecting New Yorkers to sustaining jobs by uplifting our paid care and delivery workforce, expanding ‘NYC Free Tax Prep’ and one-on-one financial counseling, and more. Together, we are building a city where workers, consumers, and businesses alike can thrive.”

“Arts, entertainment, and nightlife are the heart and soul of New York City. They are the pulse that sustains the most passionate, innovative creators of our time, drawing people from around the world,” said Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment Commissioner Anne del Castillo. “Strengthening these cultural and creative sectors is at the forefront of Mayor Adams’ economic recovery plan, because New York City’s future depends on them.”

“Mayor Adams’ plan will greatly accelerate our city's recovery by creating job opportunities for New Yorkers through inclusive and equitable growth,” said Chris Neale, acting director, Mayor’s Office of Workforce Development. “The plan will also place New Yorkers first by investing in employer-informed training and bridge programs, expanding financial empowerment services and other essential supports, and improving the quality of jobs in low-wage sectors — which will consequently help New Yorkers connect to good jobs with family-sustaining wages.""

“We applaud Mayor Adams and his administration for their steadfast commitment to tourism,” said Fred Dixon, president and CEO, NYC & Company. “As an industry that supports hundreds of thousands of jobs and impacts businesses big and small, tourism is vital to the city’s economic recovery efforts. We look forward to doing all we can to support New York City’s comeback and ensure we remain the world’s most welcoming and aspirational destination.”

“Governors Island served as an invaluable resource for New Yorkers during the COVID-19 pandemic, much like many of our city’s great public places,” said Clare Newman, president and CEO, Trust for Governors Island. “As the city accelerates its restart, Governors Island will play an even greater role in its recovery, by advancing equitable climate solutions and matching New Yorkers with green job opportunities through the Center for Climate Solutions, and by bringing accessible and dynamic arts and cultural experiences to New Yorkers through the launch of Governors Island Arts. I applaud the city’s ambitious vision to advance our recovery and look forward to working with Mayor Adams, Deputy Mayor Torres-Springer, partner institutions, and community stakeholders, in continuing our work to make Governors Island a vibrant resource for all New Yorkers.”

“Mayor Adams has made New York City’s economic recovery a linchpin of his policy agenda,” said Maggie Austin, senior advisor to the mayor; and director, Mayor’s Office of M/WBEs. “This vision recognizes a fundamental truth: M/WBEs are critical to the city’s economic recovery and long-term well-being. This renewed investment in the continued growth of the city’s M/WBE program is timely and necessary. I commend Mayor Adams for sharing our commitment to creating a more equitable New York City that embraces its diversity and supports its many M/WBEs and the communities they benefit.”

“Good design of the public realm is critical to New York City’s recovery and resilience, enhancing our health and wellbeing by providing welcoming spaces for social gathering, recreation, and cultural programming,” said Keri Butler, executive director, Public Design Commission. “We look forward to collaborating with Mayor Adams, Deputy Mayor Torres-Springer, and our city agency colleagues on streamlining the capital process to bring innovative and efficient design to public spaces for all New Yorkers.”

“New York City landmarks and historic neighborhoods help make the city a global destination — attracting residents, tourists, and businesses — and they play a vital role in the dynamism of the city,” said Sarah Carroll, chair, Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC). “We applaud Mayor Adams for this economic recovery blueprint. To help advance the plan’s important goals, LPC will leverage technology to streamline its permitting processes to make it easier for residents, businesses, and cultural institutions to thrive in their historic buildings. We look forward to working with the mayor and Deputy Mayor Torres-Springer to help the city come back stronger than ever.”

“There is no recovery for New York City without culture,” said Sheelah A. Feinberg, deputy commissioner, Department of Cultural Affairs. “Our city’s cultural organizations are a magnet for visitors from around the world, and our artists and cultural workers bring creative energy and social vibrancy to neighborhoods in every corner of the five boroughs. We applaud Mayor Adams’ blueprint for an economic recovery that centers the essential role of culture, and we can’t wait to work with our partners throughout the sector to ‘Get Stuff Done.’”

“For over 125 years, New York City’s public libraries have supported and strengthened the city’s workforce and overall economic health,” said Linda E. Johnson, president, Brooklyn Public Library; Tony W. Marx, president, New York Public Library; and Dennis M. Walcott, president, Queens Public Library. “As the city plans its next chapter and works towards continued recovery from the pandemic, we are proud to be a critical partner, offering free services and resources for small businesses, job-seekers, and entrepreneurs; strengthening the tech pipeline; and creating equitable access to culture, inspiring spaces, and other important community amenities. We look forward to working with Mayor Adams, Deputy Mayor Torres-Springer, and the administration to continue to best meet the needs of our communities.”

“We commend Mayor Adams and his administration for their determination and commitment to rebuilding New York City through projects and initiatives that invest in and uplift working people,” said Gary LaBarbera, president, Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York. “Mayor Adams’ ‘Blueprint for New York City’s Economic Recovery’ offers a clear vision for turning the corner on this economic and public health crisis and provides a foundation for the creation of good, middle-class careers with benefits. Our members stand ready to get to work to do whatever necessary to support New York’s economic, cultural, and social comeback.”

“Small business has taken a serious hit during the pandemic, and this blueprint is designed to support entrepreneurial resurgence across the five boroughs,” Kathy Wylde, president and CEO, Partnership for New York City. “I’m also pleased that Mayor Adams intends to reinvent the city’s approach to workforce development in order to close the skills gap and prepare New Yorkers for the jobs in the digital economy. Employers are pleased to work with him to accomplish this goal, which will increase equity and upward mobility in our city.”

Having fewer workers outside the formal economy can support sustainable development

The informal economy, comprising activities that have market value and would add to tax revenue and GDP if they were recorded, is a globally widespread phenomenon. According to the International Labour Organization, about 2 billion workers, or 60 percent of the world’s employed population ages 15 and older, spend at least part of their time in the informal sector. The size of the informal sector slowly decreases as economies develop, but with wide variations across regions and countries. Today, the informal sector still accounts for about a third of low- and middle-income countries’ economic activity—15 percent in advanced economies (see chart).

Informality covers a wide range of situations within and across countries, and it arises for a number of reasons.

On the one hand, individuals and firms may choose to remain outside the formal economy to avoid taxes and social contributions or compliance with standards and licensing requirements. This relates to the common but misconceived view that informality is caused mainly by firms and individuals “cheating” to avoid paying taxes. On the other hand, individuals may rely on informal activities as a safety net: they may lack the education and skills for formal employment or be too poor to access public and financial services. A forthcoming book compiling recent research by IMF staff and academic researchers aims to shed new light on this topic by looking in more detail at measuring informality, analyzing its drivers and economic consequences, and discussing possible policy responses.

The high incidence and persistence of informal labor, particularly in emerging market and developing economies, is increasingly recognized as an obstacle to sustainable development. Informal firms do not contribute to the tax base and tend to remain small, with low productivity and limited access to finance. As a result, economic growth in regions or countries with large informal sectors remains below potential. Informal workers are more likely to be poor than workers in the formal sector, both because they lack formal contracts and social protection and because they tend to be less educated.

The prevalence of informal work is also associated with high inequality: workers with similar skills tend to earn less in the informal sector than their formal sector peers, and the wage gap between formal and informal workers is higher at lower skill levels. This explains why the large decline in informality in Latin America observed over the past 20 years was associated with significant reductions in inequality.

Informal work is similarly linked with gender inequality. In two out of three low- and lower-middle-income countries, women are more likely than men not only to be in informal employment, but also to be in the most precarious and low-paying categories of informal employment.

Addressing informality is thus essential and urgent to support inclusive economic development and reduce poverty worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has only reinforced this sense of urgency: its crushing impact on informal activities worldwide has highlighted the need for governments to provide a lifeline for large segments of the population not covered (or not well covered) by existing social protection programs.

Designing effective policies to address informality is, however, complicated by its multiple causes and forms, both across and within countries. Informality is a response to a set of country-specific characteristics and institutions, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Extensive research and policy experiments in both developing and advanced economies nonetheless point to a common set of guiding principles for policy design. Four types of policies have proved effective:

Improving access to and quality of education is probably the single most powerful way to lower informality. Education reforms aimed both at enhancing equality of access and ensuring that students remain in school until the end of the secondary cycle (and ample technical and vocational training opportunities) are particularly important.

Tax system design should avoid inadvertently increasing incentives for individuals and firms to remain in the informal sector. It is generally recognized that simpler value-added and corporate tax systems (with no or minimal exemptions and loopholes) with lower rates, as well as low payroll taxes, help reduce informality. Supportive social protection systems, including progressive income taxes and protection for the poorest, help address distributional aspects.

Policies to enhance financial inclusion by promoting expanded access to formal (or bank-based) financial services can help lower informality. Lack of access to finance is a key constraint for informal firms and entrepreneurs, stifling productivity and the growth of their businesses. Countries where access to finance is greater tend to grow faster and have lower income inequality.

A range of structural policies can help increase incentives and lower the cost of formalization. Labor market regulations can be simplified to ensure greater flexibility and facilitate informal workers’ entry into formal employment. Competition policy can boost entry of small firms in some sectors by eliminating monopolies. Elimination of excessive regulations and bureaucratic requirements also helps. Digital platforms, including government-to-person mobile transfers, can contribute to inclusive growth by bringing financial accounts to the unbanked, empowering women financially, and helping small and medium-sized enterprises grow within the formal sector.

Informality critically affects how fast economies can grow, develop, and provide decent economic opportunities for their populations. Sustainable development requires a reduction in informality over time, but this process will inevitably be gradual because the informal sector is currently the only viable income source for billions of people. Informality is best tackled by steady reforms—such as investment in education—and policies that address its underlying causes. Attacks on the sector motivated by the view that it is generally operating illegally and evading taxes are not the answer.

Kicking off 2024, the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics reported last week that the U.S. economy added over 350,000 jobs in January – far exceeding expectations. The unemployment rate was 3.7 percent for the third month in a row coming in below 4% for two straight years – the longest such streak since the 1960s. In total, 14.8 million jobs have been created under President Biden, with 3.1 million created last year alone.

In addition to last week’s jobs numbers, the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) recently reported an increase of 3.3 percent in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2023 .

“Last week’s jobs report made it explicitly clear that the United States has the strongest economy in the world,” said Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. “This significant increase in jobs is a direct reflection of President Biden’s ongoing commitment to build an economy from the middle out and bottom up.”

Wages rose faster than expected in January as well. Average hourly pay climbed a sharp 0.6% from December, the fastest monthly gain in nearly two years, and 4.5% from January 2023. Average hourly earnings increased 0.6%, double the monthly estimate. On a year-over-year basis, wages jumped 4.5%, well above the 4.1% forecast. In addition, consumer spending on both goods and services beat expectations in November and December.

America’s economy is the strongest in the world with 14.8 million jobs created under President Biden. As part of his economic agenda, President Biden is committed to creating more American jobs and making smart economic investments in our country to safeguard U.S. competitiveness. For more information, see last week’s statement by President Biden on the January Jobs Report.

The government had previously estimated that the economy expanded at a 3.2% rate last quarter.

The Commerce Department’s revised measure of the nation’s gross domestic product — the total output of goods and services — confirmed that the economy decelerated from its sizzling 4.9% rate of expansion in the July-September quarter.

But last quarter’s growth was still a solid performance, coming in the face of higher interest rates and powered by growing consumer spending, exports and business investment in buildings and software. It marked the sixth straight quarter in which the economy has grown at an annual rate above 2%.

For all of 2023, the U.S. economy — the world’s biggest — grew 2.5%, up from 1.9% in 2022. In the current January-March quarter, the economy is believed to be growing at a slower but still decent 2.1% annual rate, according to a forecasting model issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.

Thursday’s GDP report also suggested that inflation pressures were continuing to ease. The Federal Reserve’s favored measure of prices — called the personal consumption expenditures price index — rose at a 1.8% annual rate in the fourth quarter. That was down from 2.6% in the third quarter, and it was the smallest rise since 2020, when COVID-19 triggered a recession and sent prices falling.

Stripping out volatile food and energy prices, so-called core inflation amounted to 2% from October through December, unchanged from the third quarter.

The economy’s resilience over the past two years has repeatedly defied predictions that the ever-higher borrowing rates the Fed engineered to fight inflation would lead to waves of layoffs and probably a recession. Beginning in March 2022, the Fed jacked up its benchmark rate 11 times, to a 23-year high, making borrowing much more expensive for businesses and households.

Yet the economy has kept growing, and employers have kept hiring — at a robust average of 251,000 added jobs a month last year and 265,000 a month from December through February.

At the same time, inflation has steadily cooled: After peaking at 9.1% in June 2022, it has dropped to 3.2%, though it remains above the Fed’s 2% target. The combination of sturdy growth and easing inflation has raised hopes that the Fed can manage to achieve a “soft landing” by fully conquering inflation without triggering a recession.

Thursday’s report was the Commerce Department’s third and final estimate of fourth-quarter GDP growth. It will release its first estimate of January-March growth on April 25.","(0, 'GDP')"

Yet it could also replace jobs and deepen inequality.

The rapid advance of artificial intelligence has captivated the world, causing both excitement and alarm, and raising important questions about its potential impact on the global economy. The net effect is difficult to foresee, as AI will ripple through economies in complex ways. What we can say with some confidence is that we will need to come up with a set of policies to safely leverage the vast potential of AI for the benefit of humanity.

Reshaping the Nature of Work

In a new analysis, IMF staff examine the potential impact of AI on the global labor market. Many studies have predicted the likelihood that jobs will be replaced by AI. Yet we know that in many cases AI is likely to complement human work. The IMF analysis captures both these forces.

The findings are striking: almost 40 percent of global employment is exposed to AI. Historically, automation and information technology have tended to affect routine tasks, but one of the things that sets AI apart is its ability to impact high-skilled jobs. As a result, advanced economies face greater risks from AI—but also more opportunities to leverage its benefits—compared with emerging market and developing economies.

In advanced economies, about 60 percent of jobs may be impacted by AI. Roughly half the exposed jobs may benefit from AI integration, enhancing productivity. For the other half, AI applications may execute key tasks currently performed by humans, which could lower labor demand, leading to lower wages and reduced hiring. In the most extreme cases, some of these jobs may disappear.

In emerging markets and low-income countries, by contrast, AI exposure is expected to be 40 percent and 26 percent, respectively. These findings suggest emerging market and developing economies face fewer immediate disruptions from AI. At the same time, many of these countries don’t have the infrastructure or skilled workforces to harness the benefits of AI, raising the risk that over time the technology could worsen inequality among nations.

AI could also affect income and wealth inequality within countries. We may see polarization within income brackets, with workers who can harness AI seeing an increase in their productivity and wages—and those who cannot falling behind. Research shows that AI can help less experienced workers enhance their productivity more quickly. Younger workers may find it easier to exploit opportunities, while older workers could struggle to adapt.

The effect on labor income will largely depend on the extent to which AI will complement high-income workers. If AI significantly complements higher-income workers, it may lead to a disproportionate increase in their labor income. Moreover, gains in productivity from firms that adopt AI will likely boost capital returns, which may also favor high earners. Both of these phenomena could exacerbate inequality.

In most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality, a troubling trend that policymakers must proactively address to prevent the technology from further stoking social tensions. It is crucial for countries to establish comprehensive social safety nets and offer retraining programs for vulnerable workers. In doing so, we can make the AI transition more inclusive, protecting livelihoods and curbing inequality.

An Inclusive AI-Driven World

AI is being integrated into businesses around the world at remarkable speed, underscoring the need for policymakers to act.

To help countries craft the right policies, the IMF has developed an AI Preparedness Index that measures readiness in areas such as digital infrastructure, human-capital and labor-market policies, innovation and economic integration, and regulation and ethics.

The human-capital and labor-market policies component, for example, evaluates elements such as years of schooling and job-market mobility, as well as the proportion of the population covered by social safety nets. The regulation and ethics component assesses the adaptability to digital business models of a country’s legal framework and the presence of strong governance for effective enforcement.

Using the index, IMF staff assessed the readiness of 125 countries. The findings reveal that wealthier economies, including advanced and some emerging market economies, tend to be better equipped for AI adoption than low-income countries, though there is considerable variation across countries. Singapore, the United States and Denmark posted the highest scores on the index, based on their strong results in all four categories tracked.

Guided by the insights from the AI Preparedness Index, advanced economies should prioritize AI innovation and integration while developing robust regulatory frameworks. This approach will cultivate a safe and responsible AI environment, helping maintain public trust. For emerging market and developing economies, the priority should be laying a strong foundation through investments in digital infrastructure and a digitally competent workforce.

The AI era is upon us, and it is still within our power to ensure it brings prosperity for all.

Many of the downside risks flagged in our April World Economic Outlook have begun to materialize.

Higher-than-expected inflation, especially in the United States and major European economies, is triggering a tightening of global financial conditions. China’s slowdown has been worse than anticipated amid COVID-19 outbreaks and lockdowns, and there have been further negative spillovers from the war in Ukraine. As a result, global output contracted in the second quarter of this year.

Under our baseline forecast, growth slows from last year’s 6.1 percent to 3.2 percent this year and 2.9 percent next year, downgrades of 0.4 and 0.7 percentage points from April. This reflects stalling growth in the world’s three largest economies—the United States, China and the euro area—with important consequences for the global outlook.

In the United States, reduced household purchasing power and tighter monetary policy will drive growth down to 2.3 percent this year and 1 percent next year. In China, further lockdowns, and the deepening real estate crisis pushed growth down to 3.3 percent this year—the slowest in more than four decades, excluding the pandemic. And in the euro area, growth is revised down to 2.6 percent this year and 1.2 percent in 2023, reflecting spillovers from the war in Ukraine and tighter monetary policy.

Despite slowing activity, global inflation has been revised up, in part due to rising food and energy prices. Inflation this year is anticipated to reach 6.6 percent in advanced economies and 9.5 percent in emerging market and developing economies—upward revisions of 0.9 and 0.8 percentage points respectively—and is projected to remain elevated longer. Inflation has also broadened in many economies, reflecting the impact of cost pressures from disrupted supply chains and historically tight labor markets.

The risks to the outlook are overwhelmingly tilted to the downside:

The war in Ukraine could lead to a sudden stop of European gas flows from Russia

Inflation could remain stubbornly high if labor markets remain overly tight or inflation expectations de-anchor, or disinflation proves more costly than expected

Tighter global financial conditions could induce a surge in debt distress in emerging market and developing economies

Renewed COVID-19 outbreaks and lockdowns might further suppress China’s growth

Rising food and energy prices could cause widespread food insecurity and social unrest

Geopolitical fragmentation might impede global trade and cooperation.

In a plausible alternative scenario where some of these risks materialize, including a full shutdown of Russian gas flows to Europe, inflation will rise and global growth decelerate further to about 2.6 percent this year and 2 percent next year—a pace that growth has fallen below just five times since 1970. Under this scenario, both the United States and the euro area experience near-zero growth next year, with negative knock-on effects for the rest of the world.

Policy priorities

Inflation at current levels represents a clear risk for current and future macroeconomic stability and bringing it back to central bank targets should be the top priority for policymakers. In response to incoming data, central banks of major advanced economies are withdrawing monetary support faster than we expected in April, while many in emerging market and developing economies had already started raising interest rates last year.

The resulting synchronized monetary tightening across countries is historically unprecedented, and its effects are expected to bite, with global growth slowing next year and inflation decelerating. Tighter monetary policy will inevitably have real economic costs, but delaying it will only exacerbate the hardship. Central banks that have started tightening should stay the course until inflation is tamed.

Targeted fiscal support can help cushion the impact on the most vulnerable. But with government budgets stretched by the pandemic and the need for an overall disinflationary macroeconomic policy stance, offsetting targeted support with higher taxes or lower government spending will ensure that fiscal policy does not make the job of monetary policy even harder.

As advanced economies raise interest rates to fight inflation, financial conditions are tightening, especially for their emerging-market counterparts. Countries must appropriately use macroprudential tools to safeguard financial stability. Where flexible exchange rates are insufficient to absorb external shocks, policymakers will need to be ready to implement foreign exchange interventions or capital flow management measures in a crisis scenario.

Such challenges come at a time when many countries lack fiscal space, with the share of low-income countries in or at high risk of debt distress at 60 percent, up from about 20 percent a decade ago. Higher borrowing costs, diminished credit flows, a stronger dollar and weaker growth will push even more into distress.

Debt-resolution mechanisms remain slow and unpredictable, hampered by difficulties in obtaining coordinated agreements from diverse creditors over their competing claims. Recent progress in implementing the Group of Twenty’s Common Framework is encouraging, but further improvements are still urgently needed.

Domestic policies to address the impacts of high energy and food prices should focus on those most affected without distorting prices. Governments should refrain from hoarding food and energy and instead look to unwind barriers to trade such as food export bans, which drive world prices higher. As the pandemic continues, governments must step up vaccination campaigns, resolve vaccine distribution bottlenecks and ensure equitable access to treatment.

Finally, mitigating climate change continues to require prompt multilateral action to limit emissions and raise investment to hasten the green transition. The war in Ukraine and soaring energy prices have put pressure on governments to turn to fossil fuels such as coal as a stopgap measure. Policymakers and regulators should ensure such measures are temporary and only cover energy shortfalls, not increase emissions overall. Credible and comprehensive climate policies to increase green energy supply should be accelerated urgently. The energy crisis also illustrates how a policy of clean, green energy independence can be compatible with national security objectives.

The outlook has darkened significantly since April. The world may soon be teetering on the edge of a global recession, only two years after the last one. Multilateral cooperation will be key in many areas, from climate transition and pandemic preparedness to food security and debt distress. Amid great challenge and strife, strengthening cooperation remains the best way to improve economic prospects and mitigate the risk of geoeconomic fragmentation.","(0, 'GDP')"

The Economic Case for Nature is part of a series of papers by the World Bank that lays out the economic rationale for investing in nature and recognizes how economies rely on nature for services that are largely underpriced. This report presents a first-of-its-kind integrated ecosystem-economy modelling exercise to assess economic policy responses to the global biodiversity crisis. Modeling the interaction between nature’s services and the global economy to 2030, the report points to a range and combination of policy scenarios available to reduce the impact of nature’s loss on economies. This modeling framework represents an important stepping-stone towards ‘nature-smart’ decision-making, as it seeks to support policymakers who face complex tradeoffs involving the management of natural capital, and hence achieving growth that is resilient and inclusive.

This report presents a novel modeling framework that integrates select ecosystem services into a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. This allows the study of the impact of changes in select ecosystem services on the global economy and vice versa between 2021 and 2030. The report assesses the link between the decline of select ecosystem services—pollination of crops by wild pollinators, climate regulation from carbon storage and sequestration, provision of food from marine fisheries and provision of timber—and the performance of key sectors that rely on these services, such as agriculture, forestry, and fisheries sectors, and related industries.

46,Middle East Conflict Risks Reshaping the Region's Economies - International Monetary Fund,Middle East Conflict Risks Reshaping the Region's Economies  International Monetary Fund,"Fri, 01 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltZi5vcmcvZW4vQmxvZ3MvQXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyMy8xMi8wMS9taWRkbGUtZWFzdC1jb25mbGljdC1yaXNrcy1yZXNoYXBpbmctdGhlLXJlZ2lvbnMtZWNvbm9taWVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,International Monetary Fund,"The conflict in Gaza and Israel is causing immense human suffering. In addition to the direct impact, the conflict will also have consequences for the broader Middle East and North Africa region, with impacts on both people and economies. This comes at a time when economic activity in the region was already expected to slow, falling from 5.6 percent in 2022 to 2 percent in 2023.

The extent of the impact on the region remains highly uncertain and will depend on the conflict’s duration, intensity, and spread. A large-scale conflict would constitute a major economic challenge for the region. Its containment hinges on the success of international efforts to prevent further escalation to the broader region. What is certain is that forecasts for the most directly exposed economies will be downgraded and that policies to buffer economies against shocks and preserve stability will be critical.

No doubt, Israel and the West Bank and Gaza are hardest hit. But the economic impact extends far beyond the area of fighting. The neighboring countries of Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon are already enduring economic reverberations. Amid concerns about the threat of escalation, visitors have been canceling travel to the region, hitting hard at the very lifeline of these economies. Tourism, which accounted for 35 percent to almost 50 percent of goods and services exports in these economies in 2019, is a critical source of foreign exchange and employment. Tourism-dependent economies like Lebanon, where hotel occupancy rates fell by 45 percentage points in October compared to a year ago, will see knock-on effects for growth.

The impact on energy and financial markets has been limited and temporary. After an initial surge, oil prices retreated and are now below pre-conflict levels, reflecting changes in global demand conditions (as there was no disruption to oil production). Natural gas prices have also come down after a large spike but are still about 25 percent above pre-conflict levels.

Government bond yields have climbed for some economies, but the broader impact has so far been minimal. Net portfolio flows to the region—a sign of investment sentiment—were on a downward trend that accelerated with the crisis but have since reverted to pre-conflict levels.

Despite these factors, elevated uncertainty about the trajectory of the conflict is eroding consumer and firm confidence, which could drive a drop in spending and investment. Absent a lasting ceasefire, and even if the conflict remains contained, uncertainty could impact the broader Middle East and North Africa region. Thus, where the impact has been limited so far, growth could deteriorate if hesitancy begins weighing on investment decisions.

And crises can also expose underlying vulnerabilities, exacerbating downside risks to the outlook. Rising risk premia could push up borrowing costs, which could quickly impact highly indebted economies. Moreover, fragile and conflict-affected states in the region, such as Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, could experience a decline in critical aid flows if the focus of donors shifts away and the envelope of international aid does not expand to meet rising global needs.

Risk of escalation persists

Against this background, an escalation of the conflict could be a tipping point for the region. The ramifications would be far-reaching, quickly spreading beyond immediate neighbors to economies such as Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Yemen. The more prolonged the conflict, the more impacted the tourism, trade, investment, and other financial channels would become. Refugee flows could increase significantly, adding to social and fiscal pressures in the countries that receive them and potentially causing more protracted weakness.

In a region that produces 35 percent of the world’s oil exports and 14 percent of gas exports, the impact of a potential production disruption looms large. However, unlike in past episodes, even if prices were to spike in response to events, oil producers, particularly those in the region, can tap into ample spare capacity to quickly boost production, helping to mitigate the impact.

Prepare now

Undoubtedly, this crisis will reshape the region’s future. Where the economic impact is acute, or risks are elevated, prudent crisis management and precautionary policies will be critical in the near term. This crisis could inaugurate an era of high uncertainty for many countries if not properly addressed.

For others bracing themselves for the potential shock waves to come, it is key to not lose sight of the important reform and resilience agenda, especially considering existing structural challenges and a more shock-prone global environment. Countries must prepare by fortifying policy buffers where needed and ensuring fiscal and external sustainability. As highlighted in our latest Regional Economic Outlook, appropriately designed and sequenced structural reforms can help support both near-term growth and longer-term growth prospects. Stronger and more resilient economies are also more likely to withstand sudden shocks.

The IMF is closely engaged with the region to help countries mitigate the impact of adverse spillovers. Countries with IMF-supported program engagements (Egypt, Jordan, Mauritania, Morocco) can use these programs to anchor good policies. In Egypt, staff is engaged with the authorities to move forward with the program reviews. The recent staff-level agreement on a Fund-supported program for Jordan—in train since mid-2023—sets the path for continued shelter against the storm. Morocco’s Flexible Credit Line arrangement, which reflects its very strong fundamentals and policy settings, also serves as a buffer against adverse shocks.

More broadly, addressing these challenges provides an opportunity to reset. The IMF is revising the economic outlook for the Middle East and North Africa in close collaboration with its members and stands ready to step up needed support through policy advice, technical assistance, and financing to countries in the region.

Agile multilateral support is vital to tackle common challenges posed by debt vulnerabilities, climate change, and limited concessional financing—especially for countries hit by shocks not of their making.

Outlook: resilience amid challenges

In April, the IMF projected global growth at 2.8 percent in 2023, down from 3.4 percent in 2022. The bulk of it–over 70 percent–is expected to come from the Asia-Pacific region.

Yet, recent high frequency indicators paint a mixed picture: weakness in manufacturing contrasts with resilience in services across the G20 countries and strong labor markets in advanced economies. At the same time, financial fragilities uncovered by tight monetary policy require careful management—particularly as restoring price stability remains a priority.

Global headline inflation seems to have peaked, and core inflation has eased somewhat, particularly in India. But in most G20 countries—especially advanced economies—inflation remains well above central banks’ targets.

Tackling inflation and boosting growth

In the fight against inflation there are some early signs of monetary policy transmitting to activity, with bank lending standards tightening in the euro area and the United States. That said, policymakers should avoid “premature celebrations”: lessons from previous inflationary episodes show that easing policy too early can undo progress on inflation.

That’s why it is vital to stay the course on monetary policy until inflation is durably brought down to target, while closely monitoring financial sector risks. Here, clear central bank communication and financial sector oversight are needed to reduce the risk of disruptive shifts in financial conditions.

Fiscal policy must also play its part. Tightening the purse strings after a period of pandemic-related exceptional support can support disinflation, rebuild buffers, and enhance debt sustainability, while temporary and targeted measures may be needed to help vulnerable people cope with the immediate cost-of-living crisis.

At the same time, consolidation efforts should protect growth-enhancing investments where space allows. Why? Because while prospects are mixed in the near term, the medium-term outlook for the global economy remains bleak.

The IMF forecast for global growth over the medium-term is around 3 percent—well below the historical average of 3.8 percent during 2000-19. Moreover, economic fragmentation will both undermine growth and make it harder to tackle pressing global challenges, from rising sovereign debt crises to the existential threat of climate change.

The importance of joint action

The good news is that we have seen how the international community can deliver when differences are set aside.

In June, we saw the breakthrough on Zambia's debt restructuring. That was a significant milestone for the G20 Common Framework which was born out of efforts from the country authorities as well as both Paris Club members and other countries such as China, India, and Saudi Arabia. The agreement unlocks further financing as part of the $1.3 billion IMF arrangement agreed in August 2022.

In addition to progress on debt restructuring for Chad, this outcome also builds on trust and better understanding among creditors and debtors ushered in through the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable.

But the work is not yet done. More effort is needed to accelerate the debt restructuring process through clear timelines, debt service suspension during negotiations, and improved creditor coordination on debt treatment for countries outside the Common Framework.

The G20 last month also announced the achievement of the $100 billion in pledges of special drawing rights (SDRs) to be channeled from richer to poorer countries. Set by the G20 in the wake of the IMF’s record $650 billion allocation of SDRs in 2021, meeting this target is a strong signal of broad international solidarity. We should also take inspiration from members who lifted the ambition of their pledges for SDR channeling: France and Japan to 40 percent of their allocations, and China to 34 percent.

Such exceptional generosity has allowed the IMF to do even more for our members. Around $29 billion in SDRs pledged to the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) since 2020 is helping us deliver higher and larger financial support to low-income countries at zero interest.

Moreover, some $42 billion in SDRs have already been provided to the IMF’s Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) that was launched last year. Nine members have had their RST funding approved and dozens more have submitted requests.

Programs under the RST will support climate reforms, such as integrating climate considerations into fiscal planning in Costa Rica and strengthening climate-related risk management for financial institutions in Seychelles. And in Rwanda and Barbados, resources from the RST are complementing support from multilateral development banks which together are expected to catalyze additional financing from the private sector, including private investment in climate projects.

Supporting vulnerable countries

Important as these milestones are, however, they alone are not enough.

Many vulnerable emerging market and low-income economies are at the sharp end of multiple shocks and fundamental transitions.

Take climate change, where they have contributed very little to the problem, but are most vulnerable to the consequences. Or the cost-of-living crisis and high interest rates, which take a disproportionate toll, pushing more countries toward debt distress and threatening development prospects. Add to this increasing economic fragmentation that could deprive them from the benefits of an integrated global economy that delivered high growth and raised living standards for billions of people.

Taken together, these challenges mean countries will need more support in the months and years ahead—to ensure economic stability and get back on the path to income convergence with advanced economies. Strong multilateral institutions have a vital role to play in providing this support, especially IDA, the World Bank’s fund for low-income countries, and the IMF.

IMF reforms and resources

Many countries have navigated difficult transitions before, and at each turn the IMF has been part of the global response, adapting to help our members and their people confront new challenges. Now – faced by a fresh set of transitions – we will continue to adapt and respond with agility: through both timely policy changes and stronger resources.

The overriding priority is a prompt and successful completion of the 16th quota review: increasing the overall size of the IMF’s quota resources—which are critical for a robust global finance safety net— with mindfulness of how the global economy has evolved.

This must be complemented by decisions to replenish the Fund’s concessional resources for vulnerable countries: a fully funded PRGT and a replenished Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust that provides debt service relief when countries are hit by large shocks.

In parallel, we are exploring reforms to our lending toolkit, including adjustments to precautionary instruments to better suit the needs of our membership. We are also looking at ways to better account for how climate change affects debt sustainability and to enhance our support for countries hit by climate related shocks.

Together, these steps will ensure the IMF remains an inclusive institution capable of serving the needs of its entire membership, especially vulnerable emerging and developing economies.

G20’s key role

In a more shock-prone world and at a time of fundamental transitions—from climate change and debt distress to trade tensions and economic fragmentation—the world has high expectations of international policymakers, and rightly so.

We must act now and act together to get all countries back on a sustainable path to growth and prosperity.

This calls for strong leadership from the G20 to ensure the international financial architecture is fit for purpose with a well-resourced and representative IMF at its center. The global response must be commensurate in size to the world’s challenges.","(4, 'national debt')"

As G20 finance ministers and central bank governors meet virtually this week, the world continues to climb back from the worst recession in peacetime since the Great Depression.

The IMF recently projected global GDP growth at 5.5 per cent this year and 4.2 per cent in 2022. But it is going to be a long and uncertain ascent. Most of the world is facing a slow rollout of vaccines even as new virus mutations are spreading—and the prospects for recovery are diverging dangerously across countries and regions.

Indeed, the global economy is at a fork in the road. The question is: will policymakers take action to prevent this Great Divergence?

There is a major risk that most developing countries will languish for years to come.

As our note to the G20 meeting points out, there is a major risk that as advanced economies and a few emerging markets recover faster, most developing countries will languish for years to come. This would not only worsen the human tragedy of the pandemic, but also the economic suffering of the most vulnerable.

We estimate that, by the end of 2022, cumulative per capita income will be 13 percent below pre-crisis projections in advanced economies—compared with 18 percent for low-income countries and 22 percent for emerging and developing countries excluding China. This projected hit to per capita income will increase by millions the number of extremely poor people in the developing world.

In other words, the convergence between countries can no longer be taken for granted. Before the crisis, we forecast that income gaps between advanced economies and 110 emerging and developing countries would narrow over 2020–22. But we now estimate that only 52 economies will be catching up during that period, while 58 are set to fall behind.

This is partly because of the uneven access to vaccines. Even in the best-case scenario, most developing economies are expected to reach widespread vaccine coverage only by end-2022 or beyond. Some are especially exposed to hard-hit sectors such as tourism and oil exports, and most of them are held back by the limited room in their budgets.

Last year, advanced economies on average deployed about 24 percent of GDP in fiscal measures, compared with only 6 percent in emerging markets and less than 2 percent in low-income countries. Cross-country comparisons also show how more sizable crisis support was often associated with a smaller loss in employment.

And it is not just divergence across countries. We also see an accelerated divergence within countries: the young, the low-skilled, women, and informal workers have been disproportionately affected by job losses. And millions of children are still facing disruptions to education. Allowing them to become a lost generation would be an unforgiveable mistake.

It would also deepen the long-term economic scars of the crisis, which would make it even more difficult to reduce inequality and boost growth and jobs. Think of the challenges ahead: for G20 economies alone (excluding India and Saudi Arabia due to data limitations), total employment losses are projected at more than 25 million this year and close to 20 million in 2022, relative to pre-crisis projections.

So again, we stand at a fork in the road—and if we are to reverse this dangerous divergence between and within countries, we must take strong policy actions now. I see three priorities:

First, step up efforts to end the health crisis.

We know that the pandemic is not over anywhere until it is over everywhere . While new infections worldwide have recently declined, we are concerned that multiple rounds of vaccinations may be needed to preserve immunity against new variants.

That is why we need much stronger international collaboration to accelerate the vaccine rollout in poorer countries. Additional financing to secure doses and pay for logistics is critical. So, too, is timely reallocation of excess vaccines from surplus to deficit countries, and a significant scaling up of vaccine production capacity for 2022 and beyond. Insuring vaccine producers against the downside risks of overproduction may be an option worth considering.

We also need to ensure greater access to therapies and testing, including virus sequencing, while steering clear of restrictions on exports of medical supplies. The economic arguments for coordinated action are overwhelming. Faster progress in ending the health crisis could raise global income cumulatively by $9 trillion over 2020–25. That would benefit all countries, including around $4 trillion for advanced economies—which beats by far any measure of vaccine-related costs.

Second, step up the fight against the economic crisis.

Led by G20 countries, the world has taken unprecedented and synchronized measures, including nearly $14 trillion in fiscal actions. Governments need to build on these efforts by continuing to provide fiscal support—appropriately calibrated and targeted to the stage of the pandemic, the state of their economies, and their policy space.

The key is to help maintain livelihoods, while seeking to ensure that otherwise viable companies do not go under. This requires not just fiscal measures, but also maintaining favorable financial conditions through accommodative monetary and financial policies, which support the flow of credit to households and firms.

The considerable monetary easing by major central banks has also enabled several developing economies to regain access to global capital markets and borrow at record-low rates to support spending, despite their historic recessions. Given the gravity of the crisis, there is no alternative to continued monetary policy support. But there are legitimate concerns around unintended consequences, including excessive risk-taking and market exuberance.

One risk going forward—especially in the face of diverging recoveries—is the potential for market volatility in response to changing financial conditions. Major central banks will need to carefully communicate their monetary policy plans to prevent excess volatility in financial markets, both at home and in the rest of the world.

Third, step up support to vulnerable countries.

Given their limited resources and policy space, many emerging market and low-income nations could soon be faced with an excruciating choice between maintaining macroeconomic stability, tackling the health crisis, and meeting peoples’ basic needs.

Their increased vulnerability not only affects their own prospects for recovery from the crisis, but also the speed and scale of the global recovery; and it can be a destabilizing force in a number of already fragile areas. Vulnerable countries will need substantial support as part of a comprehensive effort:

The first step begins at home, with governments raising more domestic revenue, making public spending more efficient, and improving the business environment. At the same time, international efforts are critical to further scale up concessional financing and leverage private finance, including through stronger risk-sharing instruments.

Another option under consideration is a new SDR allocation to help address the global long-term need for reserves. This could add a substantial, direct liquidity boost to countries, without adding to debt burdens. It could also expand the capacity of bilateral donors to provide new resources for concessional support, including for health spending. An SDR allocation served the world well in tackling the global financial crisis in 2009—it could serve us well again now.

Following a comprehensive approach also means dealing with debt. The G20’s debt service suspension initiative (DSSI) quickly freed up vital resources. And the new Common Framework can go even further: facilitating timely and orderly debt treatments for DSSI-eligible countries, with broad creditor participation including the private sector. These treatments should involve debt service reprofiling to help countries facing large financing needs, and deeper relief where debt burdens have become unsustainable. With the first requests in, the Common Framework should be swiftly operationalized by all creditors—official and private.

For its part, the IMF has stepped up in an unprecedented manner by providing over $105 billion in new financing to 85 countries and debt service relief for our poorest members. We aim to do even more to support our 190 member countries in 2021 and beyond.

That includes supporting efforts to modernize international corporate taxation. We need a system that is truly fit for the digital economy and that is more attuned to the needs of developing countries. Here multilateral efforts will be essential to help ensure that highly profitable firms pay tax in markets where they do business and thereby strengthen public finances.

These policy measures can help address the Great Divergence. Given their resources, advanced economies will continue to invest in human capital, digital infrastructure, and the transition to the new climate economy. It is vital that poorer countries have the support they need to make similar investments, especially in the job-rich climate adaptation measures that will be essential as our planet gets warmer.

The alternative—to leave poorer countries behind—would only entrench abject inequality. Even worse, it would represent a major threat to global economic and social stability. And it would rank as a historic missed opportunity.

We can take inspiration from the spectacular international cooperation that has given us effective vaccines in record time. That spirit is now more important than ever to overcome this crisis and secure a strong and inclusive recovery.","(0, 'GDP')"

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the US government also ordered a pause in payments due on federal student loans.

This policy was effective in supporting the economy, even more so than the Biden administration’s subsequent student-loan-forgiveness plan, according to University of Chicago’s Michael Dinerstein, Chicago Booth’s Constantine Yannelis, and Booth PhD student Ching-Tse Chen. They find that households subject to the pause increased their short-term consumption and bolstered the economy—but did so by taking on an additional $1,800 in debt.

Using data from the TransUnion Consumer Credit panel at Chicago Booth’s Kilts Center for Marketing, the researchers analyzed an anonymized 10 percent sample of all TransUnion credit records from 2018 to 2022. They exploited an arcane wrinkle in the government’s student-loan programs: the payment moratorium applied only to debt due directly to the government and not to loans made by private financial institutions with federal backing.

From the TransUnion data, the researchers extracted a sample of almost 300,000 borrowers who didn’t have to make payments under the program and compared it with a sample of 355,000 borrowers who were excluded from the moratorium. The loan pause lasted from March 2020 through June 2023 and affected $1.45 trillion of student debt held by 25 million borrowers. About $250 billion of such loans owed by 12 million others weren’t eligible.","(4, 'national debt')"

Sustaining the recovery will require both monetary and fiscal support as well as accelerated structural reforms

China’s economy is set to rebound this year as mobility and activity pick up after the lifting of pandemic restrictions, providing a boost to the global economy.

The economy will expand 5.2 percent this year, according to our latest projections, versus 3 percent last year. That’s good news for China and the world as the Chinese economy is now expected to contribute a third of global growth this year.

Even so, China still faces significant economic challenges. The contraction in real estate remains a major headwind, and there is still some uncertainty around the evolution of the virus. Longer-term, headwinds to growth include a shrinking population and slowing productivity growth.

Accordingly, as we note in our annual report for China, the economy needs comprehensive macroeconomic policies and structural reforms to secure the recovery and promote balanced, green, and inclusive growth.

We recommend keeping fiscal policy neutral this year, with additional monetary policy accommodation helping secure the recovery amid muted inflation pressures and growth below its potential. Orderly restructuring of troubled property developers will also help reduce risks.

With a shrinking labor force and diminishing returns to capital investment, growth in coming years will depend on boosting declining productivity growth. Without reforms, we currently estimate growth to fall below 4 percent over the next five years.

An ambitious but feasible set of reforms can improve these prospects—importantly, in a way that is inclusive by raising the role of household consumption in demand. Reforms such as gradually lifting the retirement age to increase labor supply, strengthening unemployment and health insurance benefits, and reforming state-owned enterprises to close their productivity gap with private firms would significantly help to boost growth in coming years. Undertaking such reforms would enable China’s income level to rise by around 2.5 percent in five years.

Much is at stake. When China’s growth rate rises by 1 percentage point, growth in other countries increases by around 0.3 percentage points, according to recent IMF staff analysis. That underscores how domestic reforms could boost China’s economy and that of others too.

NASA released the results of its second agencywide economic impact report on Thursday, demonstrating how its Moon to Mars activities, investments in climate change research and technology, as well as other work generated more than $71.2 billion in total economic output during fiscal year 2021.

Combined, NASA’s impact supported more than 339,600 jobs nationwide, and generated nearly $7.7 billion in federal, state, and local taxes throughout the United States.

“Investment in NASA’s missions is an investment in American workers, American innovation, and American competitiveness for the 21st century. NASA is positioning our partners in commercial space and the national economy to win the future of spaceflight in 21st century as we prepare to return astronauts to the Moon, and then go on to Mars,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “While our work will always push the limits throughout the cosmos, it also strengthens the planet beneath our feet. NASA partners with small businesses, industry, academia, and other government agencies to address engineering challenges, and to transfer out our technologies, capabilities, and data all for public benefit here on Earth. NASA may be a small federal agency, but we punch above our weight, fueling growth in American industry with good-paying, quality jobs in all 50 states and maintaining our leadership in space and science.”

The study found NASA’s Moon to Mars exploration approach generated more than $20.1 billion in total economic output and supported more than 93,700 jobs nationwide. For investments in climate research and technology, the agency’s activities generated more than $7.4 billion in total economic output and supported more than 37,000 jobs nationwide.

Additional key findings of the study include:

Every state in the country benefits economically through NASA activities. Forty-six states have an economic impact of more than $10 million. Of those 46 states, nine have an economic impact of $1 billion or more.

NASA’s agencywide fiscal year 2021 economic output increased by 10.7% from fiscal year 2019, the year the agency conducted its first report.

The agency’s Moon to Mars campaign, which includes the Artemis program, generated nearly $2.2 billion in tax revenue, and saw an economic output increase of 42.6% from fiscal year 2019. These activities provided about 28% of NASA’s economic impact.

The agency’s investments in climate change research and technology generated nearly $810 million in tax revenue and provided 11% of NASA’s economic impact.

NASA has more than 2,655 active domestic and international agreements for various scientific research and technology development activities in fiscal year 2021. The International Space Station is a significant representative of international partnerships – representing 15 nations and five space agencies and has been operating for more than 20 years.

NASA has 700 different active partnerships with non-federal U.S. partners and partnerships in 44 of 50 states. For example, flight technology like NASA’s all-electric X-57 Maxwell.

NASA spinoffs, which are public products and processes that are developed with NASA technology, funding, or expertise, provide a benefit to American lives beyond dollars and jobs. The agency has recorded more than 2,000 spinoff technologies since 1976. For example, NASA’s indoor agricultural techniques in vertical farm structures are being adopted by private companies to build indoor farms.

Scientific research and development, which fuels advancements in science and technology that can help improve daily life on Earth and for humanity, enjoys the largest single-sector impact, accounting for 20% of NASA’s overall economic output.

The study was conducted by the Nathalie P. Voorhees Center for Neighborhood and Community Improvement at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

The global economic recovery is continuing, even as the pandemic resurges. The fault lines opened up by COVID-19 are looking more persistent—near-term divergences are expected to leave lasting imprints on medium-term performance. Vaccine access and early policy support are the principal drivers of the gaps.

The global economy is projected to grow 5.9 percent in 2021 and 4.9 percent in 2022, 0.1 percentage point lower for 2021 than in the July forecast. The downward revision for 2021 reflects a downgrade for advanced economies—in part due to supply disruptions—and for low-income developing countries, largely due to worsening pandemic dynamics. This is partially offset by stronger near-term prospects among some commodity-exporting emerging market and developing economies.

The bifurcation of economic institutions by conflicting parties and uncoordinated policy decisions have further compounded the socio-economic crisis stemming from active conflict, now in its seventh year. Donor fatigue, soaring global commodity prices, and adverse climate conditions will continue to pose serious threat to the already dire socio-economic conditions.

Recent Developments

Available information suggests that the Yemeni economy continued to weaken in 2021, affected by macroeconomic instability, escalating hostilities, and heavy rains and flooding, which damaged shelters and infrastructure, destroyed livelihoods, and facilitated the spread of diseases. The volume of crude oil production remained significantly below the pre-conflict levels. Non-oil economic activity continues to suffer from hostilities, interruption of basic services (electricity, telecommunications), and acute shortages of inputs, which were compounded by double taxation and distortions created by uncoordinated policy decisions by the two authorities. The war in Ukraine triggered further increases in commodity prices, heightening threats to Yemeni’s already dire food access and socio-economic conditions.

Outlook

Economic and social prospects in 2022 and beyond are highly uncertain and hinge critically on a resolution of the conflict and the overall security conditions. In this context, the flare-up of conflict, coupled with surging international oil prices, would be detrimental to the private sector’s operational environment. On the upside, robust growth in GCC countries driven by rising global energy prices may boost remittance flows to Yemen. Revenue generation in Yemen as a whole will continue to be deeply challenged by an extremely low tax base.

57,Another month of robust US job growth points to continued economic strength - The Associated Press,Another month of robust US job growth points to continued economic strength  The Associated Press,"Fri, 05 Apr 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2pvYnMtaGlyaW5nLXVuZW1wbG95bWVudC1lY29ub215LWluZmxhdGlvbi1mZWRlcmFsLXJlc2VydmUtMWU0NTZiOGRmMGUxMWIyMThlZDUwZjFlYWQ2ZjY3OTfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Associated Press,"WASHINGTON (AP) — America’s employers delivered another outpouring of jobs in March, adding a sizzling 303,000 workers to their payrolls and bolstering hopes that the economy can vanquish inflation without succumbing to a recession in the face of high interest rates.

Last month’s job growth was up from a revised 270,000 in February and was far above the 200,000 jobs that economists had forecast. By any measure, it amounted to a major burst of hiring, and it reflected the economy’s ability to withstand the pressure of high borrowing costs resulting from the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes. With the nation’s consumers continuing to spend, many employers have kept hiring to meet steady customer demand.

Friday’s report from the Labor Department also showed that the unemployment rate dipped from 3.9% to 3.8%. The jobless rate has now remained below 4% for 26 straight months, the longest such streak since the 1960s. The government also revised up its estimate of job growth in January and February by a combined 22,000.

Normally, a blockbuster bounty of new jobs would raise concerns that a vibrant labor market would force companies to sharply raise pay to attract and keep workers, thereby fanning inflation pressures. But the March jobs report showed that wage growth was mild last month, which might allay any such fears. Average hourly wages were up 4.1% from a year earlier, the smallest year-over-year increase since mid-2021. From February to March, though, hourly pay did rise 0.3% after increasing 0.2% the month before.

The economy is sure to weigh on Americans’ minds as the November presidential vote nears and they assess President Joe Biden’s re-election bid. Many people still feel squeezed by the inflation surge that erupted in the spring of 2021. Eleven rate hikes by the Fed have helped send inflation tumbling from its peak. But average prices are still about 18% higher than they were in February 2021 — a fact for which Biden might pay a political price.

In a statement Friday, though, Biden argued that the economy’s strong performance means that his policies are paying off.

“My plan is growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, investing in all Americans and giving the middle class a fair shot,” he said. “Inflation has come down significantly. We’ve come a long way, but I won’t stop fighting for hard-working families.”

The 303,000 jobs that the economy added in March were the largest gain since last May. And they boosted average monthly job growth so far this year to a vigorous 276,000, an improvement even on 2023’s robust average of 251,000.

The unemployment rate fell last month even though a sizable 469,000 people entered the labor force looking for work. That influx increased the proportion of Americans who either have a job or are looking for one from 62.5% in February to 62.7%. A bigger labor force tends to ease pressure on companies to significantly raise wages, thereby slowing inflation pressures.

Though most industries added jobs last month, hiring was mainly concentrated in three categories: Healthcare and private education, leisure and hospitality and government accounted for nearly 69% of the hiring. In addition, construction companies added a solid 39,000 jobs.

Four years after the pandemic curbed travel and forced shutdowns of restaurants, bars and entertainment venues, those industries have finally regained their pre-pandemic employment level, with a category that includes such businesses adding 49,000 jobs in March.

The Fed’s policymakers are tracking the state of the economy, the job market and inflation to determine when to begin cutting interest rates from their multi-decade highs. Rate cuts by the Fed would likely lead, over time, to lower borrowing rates across the economy.

The central bank’s policymakers started raising rates two years ago to try to tame inflation, which by mid-2022 was running at a four-decade high. Those rate hikes — 11 of them from March 2022 through July 2023 — helped drastically slow inflation. Consumer prices were up 3.2% in February from a year earlier, far below a peak of 9.1% in June 2022.

The much higher borrowing costs for individuals and companies that resulted from the Fed’s rate hikes were widely expected to trigger a recession, with waves of layoffs and a painful rise in unemployment. Yet to the surprise of just about everyone, the economy has kept growing steadily and employers have kept hiring at a healthy pace.

Some economists believe that a rise in productivity — the amount of output that workers produce per hour — made it easier for companies to hire, raise pay and post bigger profits without having to raise prices. In addition, an influx of immigrants into the job market is believed to have addressed labor shortages and slowed upward pressure on wage growth. This helped cool inflation even as the economy kept growing.

“This report is like the macroeconomist’s Holy Grail,’’ said Julia Pollak, chief economist at the online job marketplace ZipRecruiter. “It’s pointing toward noninflationary growth.”

Noting the strong job growth, influx of new workers, declining unemployment and slowing wage growth, Pollak said, “It suggests that the Fed can walk and chew gum at the same time, bringing down inflation without crippling the labor market.”

In the meantime, the Fed has signaled that it expects to cut rates three times this year. But it is awaiting more inflation data to gain further confidence that annual price increases are heading toward its 2% target. Some economists have begun to question whether the Fed will need to cut rates anytime soon in light of the consistently durable U.S. economy.

The still-strong demand for labor has meant that some employers are still struggling to fill vacancies. One of them is John Zmuda, president of Moseys Production Machinists in Anaheim, California, who said it’s still “extremely hard’’ to find workers.

Though he receives plenty of resumes, Zmuda said “it seems like most people are just wage-hunting” rather than seeking a long-term career.

Moseys, a family-owned company that supplies the defense, aerospace, healthcare industries, wants to add three or four workers to a staff of 27. Zmuda said he has raised wages 10% over the past year or so. But California’s high cost of living, especially for housing, puts off some potential recruits.

Like many manufacturers, Moseys depends heavily on robots. But for an employer, automation goes only so far.

“People bring to the table their minds and eyes,” Zmuda said. “Robots do not. People will think before they do something.’’

Likewise, in Duncan, Oklahoma, Southern Machine Works, which also supplies the aerospace and defense industries, needs four or five machinists.

“It’s really been a struggle to find anyone,’’ said Frank Burch, CEO of the third-generation family firm.

Attracting recruits to a rural town of 23,000 is difficult, especially when the oil-field-services giant Halliburton is nearby and seeking workers, too.

“We’re just hiring individuals that seem to have the mental capacity to learn the business, and then we’re teaching them through our in-house training program,” Burch said.

Employers, he suggested, will probably have to get used to tighter labor markets:

“When you look at the demographics of the country – the baby boom’s gone, the current generation just isn’t having children. I just don’t really see it changing in my lifetime.’’

Doug Burgum, researchers from North Dakota State University and industry officials.

“The oil and natural gas industry continues to be a game-changer for North Dakota,” Burgum said. “Taxes and royalties paid by the industry support our state’s significant investments in infrastructure, schools, communities, tax relief and the Legacy Fund, among other areas. The industry’s resiliency in the face of challenges such as the pandemic, extreme weather, volatile prices and misguided federal policies, demonstrates that it will continue to play a critically important role in North Dakota’s economy for generations to come.”

North Dakota State University researchers Dean Bangsund and Nancy Hodur studied the economic contribution of oil and gas exploration, extraction, transportation, processing and capital investments to the state in 2021, the most recent data available. Similar studies have been conducted every two years since 2005.

Their findings show North Dakota’s oil and gas industry directly employed 14,200 people in 2021, while economic activity from the indirect and induced effects of the industry supported an additional 35,185 jobs, for a total of 49,385 jobs attributed to the industry. Employment compensation, which includes wages, salaries and employee benefits, was estimated at $3.9 billion.

Total gross business volume, which includes direct sales in the oil and gas industry and business generated from indirect and induced economic activity throughout North Dakota, was estimated at $42.58 billion – an increase of $2.38 billion over 2019 and over 30% of the state’s overall gross business volume.

Bangsund said that while the pandemic made the last few years challenging, the oil and gas industry has learned how to maintain production through efficiencies and most of the industry’s key economic metrics are at or near pre-COVID levels.

“The North Dakota oil and natural gas industry’s economic contribution to our state has been very stable even through challenges, and it remains incredibly resilient,” said Bangsund, a research scientist in agribusiness and applied economics at NDSU.

According to another recent study conducted for the Western Dakota Energy Association (WDEA) and North Dakota Petroleum Foundation, tax revenues paid by the oil and natural gas industry in North Dakota from fiscal years 2008 to 2022, supported $5.9 billion for local communities and infrastructure, over $1.8 billion for K-12 education, $1.4 billion for water and flood control projects, over $1 billion for property tax relief, and $32 million for outdoor heritage projects across the state. Additionally, $8 billion in oil and gas taxes went into the Legacy Fund, which benefits future generations.

“The impact of the oil and natural gas industry can be seen throughout the state. From education funding to property tax relief to infrastructure funding, every county and community has and continues to benefit from this industry,” WDEA Executive Director Geoff Simon said.

Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, noted that North Dakota’s oil and natural gas industry pays more than half of all state taxes collected and provides nearly 50,000 good paying jobs in the state.

“Thanks to innovation, the tremendous resource of the Bakken, and billions of dollars invested in infrastructure by our industry, the state can count on us to continue to be a major force in the North Dakota economy for years to come,” Ness said.","(0, 'GDP')"

Overview

With the American Rescue Plan’s two-year anniversary now behind us, this blog post revisits the economic impact of pandemic response policies of the Biden Administration. The economic recovery from the pandemic in the United States has been historic relative to prior episodes with employment recovering to pre-crisis levels much faster than after recent recessions. And while a counterfactual recovery is impossible to observe, data suggests that the actions taken by the Biden Administration meaningfully contributed to the pace of recovery and strength of the labor market. One way to put this rebound in context is relative to recoveries in other advanced economies. Acknowledging that other advanced economies faced different economic shocks—notably, our European partners were more adversely affected by Russia’s war against Ukraine—the evidence shows that the U.S. economic recovery has been quite strong.

This blog assesses the U.S. recovery along three key characteristics:

The size of the U.S economy is now over 5 percent above its 2019 level

Core inflation in the United States is now lower than in many major advanced economies

The U.S. labor market recovery has been exceptionally strong

This is not to suggest that the current recovery is without its challenges. Near-term inflation remains a concern, and long-term structural challenges remain. Still, many aspects of the U.S. recovery indicate a stronger recovery in the U.S. relative to other economies.

U.S. Economic Recovery Fastest Among Comparable Advanced Economies

For many advanced economies, real GDP it is at, or above, where it was in the fourth quarter of 2019, prior to the start of the pandemic. However, there is considerable variability across countries. Not all G7 economies have fully recovered to their pre-pandemic size; by contrast, U.S. real GDP is now 5.4 percent above the level at the end of 2019.

Relative to pre-pandemic trends, economic output continues to fall short. However, the United States has performed better than other G7 economies (and the Euro area) with real GDP just 1.4 percent below trend.

The fast recovery in the United States reflects a more complete recovery in domestic consumption. In fact, U.S. household consumption expenditures returned to their pre-pandemic trend by the second quarter of 2021. However, household consumption remains below pre-pandemic trend in most other advanced economies, as the recovery in final demand remains incomplete.

Despite Higher Growth, U.S. Core Inflation is Now Lower Than in Many Other Major Advanced Economies

Faster output growth in the United States was initially accompanied by higher inflation, but inflation rates have been rising rapidly around the world. In Europe, inflation rates rose quickly in 2022 due to a combination of high natural gas prices and the restart of the European economy after tight Covid restrictions during the Delta and Omicron waves. Conversely, over the course of 2022, the United States saw substantial improvement in inflation, while European inflation rates continued to rise. Of course, energy prices in Europe have been hit particularly hard by Russia’s unlawful invasion of Ukraine. Excluding energy and food, core inflation rates (on a harmonized basis) are running under 4 percent in the United States, whereas they are nearly 6 percent in the United Kingdom and over 7 percent in the Euro area.[1]

The U.S. Labor Market Recovery Has Been Exceptionally Strong

Employment statistics appear to show striking differences across G7 economies during the Covid-era. For instance, the United States and Canada had their unemployment rates skyrocket in April and May 2020—up 11.1 and 8.5 percentage points from December 2019, respectively—while many European unemployment rates stayed relatively flat. In fact, in France and Italy unemployment rates fell markedly in the initial months of the pandemic.

Despite initial impressions, this did not reflect significant divergence in labor activity. Rather, these trends reflect differences across national labor institutions. Each government used their existing institutions to support workers and businesses through the initial Covid shutdown. In the United States and Canada, unemployment insurance was most suited to rapid, large-scale support. Many European economies also leveraged their social safety nets, often in a way that led to continued employment in official statistics—analogous to the United States’ little-used Workshare program. The broader and stronger fiscal response resulted in generally higher U.S. government deficits during the pandemic. However, deficits contracted quickly as pandemic support largely ended by the third quarter of 2021. At the end of 2022 the United States had a similar budget deficit as a share of GDP as peer countries.

The official statistics of most other G7 economies do not show a sharp rise in the unemployment rate in the spring of 2020, nor a corresponding robust recovery. Again, this is partially a result of differing labor market institutions and pandemic-era policies, rather than a reflection of underlying differences in labor activity. In January the unemployment rate in the United States reached a more than 50-year low. Germany has seen similar lows, while Canada and the United Kingdom are also near their lows.

The similar recovery in the labor market, despite disparate recoveries in output, has implications for labor productivity. Labor productivity growth in the United States has outpaced that in Europe and Japan. Here, labor market policies may be playing a role. The U.S. system is based primarily on unemployment insurance, which may have allowed for greater labor reallocation relative to systems that preserved employer attachment. In general, U.S. employment has reallocated from lower wage industries to high-wage and higher productivity industries. U.S. employment has also shifted to industries with higher average hours worked, implying a stronger recovery in hours relative to employment. This reallocation of labor may drive further gains in labor productivity going forward.","(0, 'GDP')"
62,The Potential Economic Impacts of Various Debt Ceiling Scenarios | CEA - The White House,The Potential Economic Impacts of Various Debt Ceiling Scenarios | CEA  The White House,"Wed, 03 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndoaXRlaG91c2UuZ292L2NlYS93cml0dGVuLW1hdGVyaWFscy8yMDIzLzA1LzAzL2RlYnQtY2VpbGluZy1zY2VuYXJpb3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The White House,"Summary

New analyses by both the Congressional Budget Office and the U.S. Department of the Treasury suggest the United States is rapidly approaching the date at which the government can no longer pay its bills, also known as the “X-date.” History is clear that even getting close to a breach of the U.S. debt ceiling could cause significant disruptions to financial markets that would damage the economic conditions faced by households and businesses. Real time data, shown below, indicate that markets are already pricing in political brinkmanship related to Federal government default through higher risk premia.

An actual breach of the U.S. debt ceiling would likely cause severe damage to the U.S. economy. Analysis by CEA and outside researchers illustrates that if the U.S. government were to default on its obligations—whether to creditors, contractors, or citizens—the economy would quickly shift into reverse, with the depth of the losses a function of how long the breach lasted. A protracted default would likely lead to severe damage to the economy, with job growth swinging from its current pace of robust gains to losses numbering in the millions.

Table 1: Estimated Economic Effects of Debt Ceiling Standoff: Q3 2023

In other words, defaulting on our government’s debt could reverse the historic economic gains that have been achieved since the president took office: an unemployment rate near a 50-year low, the creation of 12.6 million jobs, and robust consumer spending that has consistently powered a solid, reliable growth engine, supported by paychecks from the strong job market and healthy household balance sheets.

Because the government would be unable to enact counter-cyclical measures in a breach-induced recession, there would be limited policy options to help buffer the impact on households and businesses. The ability of households and businesses, especially small businesses, to borrow through the private sector to offset this economic pain would also be compromised. The risks engendered by the default would cause interest rates to skyrocket, including those on the financial instruments that households and businesses use—Treasury bonds, mortgages, and credit card interest rates.

Potential impacts of approaching the debt ceiling

There is no historical precedent for the U.S. government passing the X-date and breaching its debt ceiling without Congress raising or suspending the statutory limit on federal debt. Nevertheless, there is broad consensus amongst economists that such an event would generate an entirely-avoidable economic catastrophe.

For example, Brookings Institution analysts Wendy Edelberg and Louise Sheiner recently argued that “Worsening expectations regarding a possible default would make significant disruptions in financial markets increasingly probable” and that “such financial market disruptions would very likely be coupled with declines in the price of equities, a loss of consumer and business confidence, and a contraction in access to private credit markets.”

In fact, we have already seen evidence of significant market stress correlated with debt ceiling tensions. Yields on Treasury bills with maturity dates around the X-date have increased considerably—directly increasing the cost of borrowing for the government and thus the cost to taxpayers. Figure 1 below demonstrates this; since the middle of April, yields on short-duration Treasury bills around the expected X-date have increased by nearly 1 percentage point, or roughly 20 percent.

Figure 1: Treasury bill yield curve

The cost of insuring U.S. debt has also risen substantially and is now at an all-time high, reflecting increased worries about a U.S. default. In fact, credit default swap (CDS) spreads—the insurance premiums that must be paid to insure U.S. debt—started to increase dramatically in April, as demonstrated by Figure 2 below.

Figure 2: One-year U.S. government bond insurance premiums

The closer the U.S. gets to the debt ceiling, the more we expect these market-stress indicators to worsen, leading to increased volatility in equity and corporate bond markets and inhibiting firms’ ability to finance themselves and engage in the productive investment that is essential for extending the current expansion.

Risks of a brief default

Should we breach the debt ceiling, the costs to the economy would be likely to be quickly felt. Mark Zandi, Chief Economist of Moody’s Analytics, predicted that even with a brief default, a “crisis, characterized by spiking interest rates and plunging equity prices, would be ignited. Short-term funding markets, which are essential to the flow of credit that helps finance the economy’s day-to-day activities, likely would shut down as well.” Right after a default, Fitch Ratings reports that “the US’s rating would be moved to “‘RD’ (Restricted Default) [and] affected Treasury securities would carry a ‘D’ rating until the default was cured.”

According to Moody’s, even a short debt limit breach could lead to a decline in real GDP, nearly 2 million lost jobs, and an increase in the unemployment rate to nearly 5 percent from its current level of 3.5 percent. Moody’s also notes that even a short debt limit breach could lead to lastingly higher interest costs: “If Treasury securities are no longer perceived as risk-free by global investors, future generations of Americans would pay a steep economic price.” A Brookings analysis noted that losing the unparalleled safety and liquidity of the Treasury market due to default could translate into over $750 billion in higher federal borrowing costs over the next decade. Peterson Institute economists have argued that lower demand for Treasuries would weaken the dollar’s role in the global economy: “This weakening of official dollar purchases would likely increase volatility in the dollar’s value against other currencies and decrease liquidity, prompting investors to reduce their holdings of dollars in any form.”

Risks of a protracted default

The costs would be even greater under a protracted default. A CEA simulation of the effect of a protracted default (Figure 3) shows an immediate, sharp recession on the order of the Great Recession.[1] In 2023 Q3, the first full quarter of the simulated debt ceiling breach, the stock market plummets 45 percent, leading to a hit to retirement accounts; meanwhile, consumer and business confidence take substantial hits, leading to a pullback in consumption and investment. Unemployment increases 5 percentage points as consumers cut consumption, and businesses lay off workers. Unlike the Great Recession and the COVID recession, the government is unable to help consumers and businesses. As the breach continues, the economy heals slowly, and unemployment is still 3 percentage points higher at the end of 2023.

Figure 3: Employment gains and losses under clean debt ceiling increase vs. protracted default, 2023 Q3-2024 Q1

A recent analysis by Moody’s, using a different model of the macroeconomy, arrived at a similar conclusion. They predict that under a clean debt ceiling increase, job growth continues over the next few quarters, adding 900,000 jobs. But under a protracted default scenario, job losses amount to almost 8 million, an extremely stark difference of similar magnitudes to our own modeling.

Without the ability to spend on counter-cyclical measures such as extended unemployment insurance, Federal and state governments would be hamstrung in responding to this turmoil and unable to buffer households from the impacts. Neither would households be able to borrow through the private sector as the interest rates on the financial instruments that households and businesses use—Treasury bonds, mortgages, and credit card interest rates—would skyrocket due to risks of an uncertain future.

While policy makers have thus far, in the long history of our Nation, avoided inflicting such damage on the American and even global economies, virtually every analysis we have seen finds that default leads to deep, immediate recessionary conditions. Economists may not agree on much, but when it comes to the magnitude of risks invoked by closely approaching or breaching the debt ceiling, we share this deeply troubling consensus.

[1] The CEA simulation was done using FRB/US assuming negative shocks to consumer and business confidence that mimic those experienced during the Great Recession, increased interest rate premiums, and 20-30 percent cutbacks in government spending. Given the current elevated level of inflation, the Taylor rule-governed federal funds rate reacts slowly to the economic calamity.","(4, 'national debt')"

Sustaining growth in private non-oil investment requires maintaining the reform momentum and sound macroeconomic policies

Saudi Arabia’s economy is undergoing a transformation, as it implements reforms to reduce oil dependence, diversify income sources, and enhance competitiveness. This year marks an important juncture as the midpoint of Saudi Arabia’s ambitious Vision 2030 journey. As shown in the latest IMF annual review of the country's economy, progress has been most notably reflected in non-oil growth, which has accelerated since 2021, averaging 4.8 percent in 2022. Despite lower overall growth reflecting additional oil production cuts, non-oil growth will remain close to 5 percent in 2023, spurred by strong domestic demand.

Diversification has been driven by improvements in the regulatory and business environment. As a result of a new set of laws to promote entrepreneurship, protect investors’ rights, and reduce the costs of doing business, new investment deals and licenses grew by 95 percent and 267 percent in 2022, respectively. In addition, the Saudi Investment Fund (PIF) has been deploying capital, including to help stimulate private sector investment.","(0, 'GDP')"

Cooperation is critical, but greater protectionism could lead to fragmentation, and even split nations into rival blocs just as fresh shocks expose the global economy's fragility.

While estimates of the cost of fragmentation vary, greater international trade restrictions could reduce global economic output by as much as 7 percent over the long term, or about $7.4 trillion in today’s dollars. That’s equivalent to the combined size of the French and German economies, and three times sub-Saharan Africa’s annual output.

More deliberate global cooperation clearly is needed. International institutions can play a vital role, bringing countries together to help solve global challenges, as IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva writes a new essay for Foreign Affairs.

There are signs cooperation is faltering. As the Chart of the Week shows, new trade barriers introduced annually have nearly tripled since 2019 to almost 3,000 last year.

Other forms of fragmentation—like technological decoupling, disrupted capital flows, and migration restrictions—will also raise costs. In addition, global flows of goods and capital have leveled off since the global financial crisis. IMF research shows geopolitical alignments increasingly influence both foreign direct investment and portfolio flows.

The IMF continues to underscore that the international community, supported by global institutions such as ours, should pursue targeted progress where common ground exists and maintain collaboration in areas where inaction would be devastating.

“Policymakers need to focus on the issues that matter most not only to the wealth of nations but also to the economic well-being of ordinary people,” Georgieva wrote in Foreign Affairs. “They must nurture the bonds of trust among countries wherever possible so they can quickly step up cooperation when the next major shock comes.”","(0, 'GDP')"

Washington, DC—According to the latest data issued today by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the National Endowment for the Arts, the arts remain a vital component of the U.S. economy. As the United States navigates a time of economic uncertainty due to the spread of COVID-19, it is important to recognize and champion the economic contributions of the arts to all 50 states, the U.S. territories, and the nation as a whole.

The sixth edition of the Arts and Cultural Production Satellite Account (ACPSA) finds that arts and culture contributed $877.8 billion, or 4.5 percent, to the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2017. That same year, there were over 5 million wage‐and‐salary workers employed in the arts and cultural sector, earning a total of $405 billion. Complete national findings are available including an interactive infographic and data tables.

The ACPSA tracks the annual economic impact of arts and cultural production from 35 industries, both commercial and nonprofit. The 35 industries that are tracked range from architectural services to sound recording and are considered a distinct sector of the nation’s economy. With the outbreak of COVID-19, many arts organizations and venues—theaters, concert halls, museums, studios, festivals, and galleries—have shut their doors until further notice from public health officials.

“Earned income accounts for a substantial share of the bottom line of most nonprofit arts organizations,” Sunil Iyengar, director of Research & Analysis at the Arts Endowment, said. “During economic downturns, the sector is acutely vulnerable—in terms of earned income, but also in fundraising. Given the lean operating budgets of such organizations, these losses can have an outsized impact, leading to fewer jobs in arts industries, and in the businesses that supply them.”

Key National Findings

As arts venues close, it will be important to monitor the impact on ticket sales.

In 2017, consumers spent $26.5 billion on admissions to performing arts events, including $17 billion on theater/musical theater/opera performances and $3.7 billion on music groups and artists (e.g., jazz, rock, and country music performances).

Arts industries that contribute the most value to the nation’s GDP are also highly reactive to swings in business cycles including:

Performing arts companies

Independent artists, writers, and performers

Arts‐related retail trade (for example museum stores and art galleries)

Even as the sector continues to respond to market forces, it is worth noting that arts and culture contribute significantly to the U.S. economy.

The arts and cultural sector add more to the economy than do construction and transportation/warehousing combined.

The value added by arts and culture to the U.S. economy is five times greater than the value from the agricultural sector.

Arts and culture added more to the U.S. economy than construction and transportation/warehousing by $87 billion and $265 billion respectively.

Arts and culture generate a widening trade surplus. From 2006 to 2017, this surplus grew 9‐fold, to more than $25 billion.

In 2017 alone, the U.S. exported nearly $30 billion more in arts and cultural goods and services than it imported.

The sector has shown capacity for rapid growth.

Between 2015 and 2017, the arts and cultural sector grew at more than twice the rate of the total U.S. economy—at nearly 4.45 percent, in terms of annual average growth rate.

Among high-growth arts industries are performing arts presenters, arts-related construction, and publishing. Arts-related web publishing and streaming grew by 29 percent.

Key State Findings

On a state level, the arts and cultural sector added $72.8 billion to the economies of rural states—i.e., states in which 30 percent or more of the population live in rural areas, equaling 18 states.

Six states significantly surpassed the average national growth rate of 5.6 percent for the period 2015-2017: Washington, California, Nevada, Utah, Georgia, and Massachusetts.

Arts and cultural value added for Average annual growth rate of

2017 (in millions) value added: 2015-2017

United States $877,809 5.6%

Nevada $8,738 9.4%

Utah $7,214 8.6%

Georgia $24,407 7.6%

Massachusetts $25,805 7.2%

Arts-related retail trade contributed considerably to the growth in Washington’s arts economy,

Arts-based web publishing and streaming added to California’s arts production.

Georgia witnessed growth in its motion picture and video industries.

Utah gained in value added by the state’s performing arts companies.

Economic value from the construction of new arts and cultural structures spiked in Massachusetts

Complete state findings are available also. In addition, through an award from the Arts Endowment, the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies (NASAA) has produced an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore key information for individual states.

About the National Endowment for the Arts

Established by Congress in 1965, the National Endowment for the Arts is the independent federal agency whose funding and support gives Americans the opportunity to participate in the arts, exercise their imaginations, and develop their creative capacities. Through partnerships with state arts agencies, local leaders, other federal agencies, and the philanthropic sector, the Arts Endowment supports arts learning, affirms and celebrates America’s rich and diverse cultural heritage, and extends its work to promote equal access to the arts in every community across America.

Finally, we provide links to key data sources with summaries.

Size and Composition of the U.S. Agricultural Workforce

The U.S. agricultural workforce has long consisted of a mixture of two groups of workers: (1) self-employed farm operators and their family members, and (2) hired workers. Both types of employment were in long-term decline from 1950 to 1990, as mechanization contributed to rising agricultural productivity, reducing the need for labor. Since 1990, employment levels have stabilized.

The reduction in self-employed and family labor through 1990 was more rapid than the decline in hired labor. According to data from the Farm Labor Survey (FLS) of USDA's National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS), the number of self-employed and family farmworkers declined from 7.60 million in 1950 to 2.01 million in 1990, a 74-percent reduction. Over this same period, average annual employment of hired farmworkers—including on-farm support personnel and those who work for farm labor contractors—declined from 2.33 million to 1.15 million, a 51-percent reduction. As a result, the proportion of hired workers has increased over time.

The rest of this page describes the employment, earnings, demographic characteristics, and other information for the hired farm labor force only. (Information on the well-being of the self-employed farmers and their families may be found on the ERS topic page on Farm Household Well-being.)

Hired farmworkers make up less than 1 percent of all U.S. wage and salary workers, but they play an essential role in U.S. agriculture. According to data from the 2017 Census of Agriculture, wages and salaries plus contract labor costs represented just 12 percent of production expenses for all farms, but 43 percent for greenhouse and nursery operations and 39 percent for fruit and tree nut operations.

Hired farmworkers are found in a variety of occupations, including field crop workers, nursery workers, livestock workers, graders and sorters, agricultural inspectors, supervisors, and hired farm managers. The majority are wage and salary workers, hired directly by farmers, but some are employees of agricultural service companies, including farm labor contractors, custom harvest providers, and management service providers. Many industrywide employment estimates also include support personnel on farms, such as human resource managers, sales agents, and truck drivers.

Many hired farmworkers are foreign-born people from Mexico and countries in Central America, with many lacking authorization to work legally in the United States. In recent years, farmworkers have become more settled, fewer migrating long distances from home to work, and fewer pursuing seasonal follow-the-crop migration. The number of young, recent immigrants working in agriculture has also fallen, and as a result the farm workforce is aging. Over the past 30 years, wages for hired farmworkers have gradually risen, both in real terms and in relation to wages for the average nonsupervisory worker in a nonfarm occupation.

Hired farmworkers are employed in both metro (urban) and nonmetro (rural) counties. The statistics presented here refer to farmworkers nationwide, unless otherwise indicated.

Recent Trends in the Employment of Hired Farmworkers

According to data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), wage and salary employment in agriculture (measured as the annual average number of full- and part-time jobs)—including support industries such as farm labor contracting—stabilized in the 2000s and has been on a gradual upward trend since 2010, rising from 1.11 million in 2012 to 1.18 million in 2022, a gain of 6 percent.

From 2012–2022, employment increases were highest in crop support services (which added 27,500 jobs, a 12-percent increase) and the livestock sector (which added 31,400 jobs, a 10-percent increase). It should be noted that the QCEW is based on unemployment insurance records, not on surveys of farms or households. As a result, it does not cover smaller farm employers in those States that exempt such employers from participation in the unemployment insurance system. However, survey data sources, such as the American Community Survey and the Current Population Survey, also find rising farm employment since the turn of the century.

Demographic Characteristics of Hired Farmworkers

Demographic information on farmworkers can be found in the American Community Survey (ACS) from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census. These data also allow us to distinguish among manual laborers, managers/supervisors, and other occupations in the industry. Farm laborers have lower levels of educational attainment, are slightly younger than U.S. private wage and salary workers, are more likely to be Hispanic of Mexican origin, and are less likely to be citizens than both workers in other occupations in agriculture and the U.S. wage and salary workforce as a whole.

Demographic characteristics of U.S. hired farmworkers and all wage and salary workers, 2021 Item Farm laborers, graders and sorters Farm managers, inspectors, and supervisors All other occupations in agriculture Agriculture: All occupations All U.S. private wage and salary workers Percent female 28 17 33 28 44 Average age in years 39.7 43.7 42.0 40.9 40.6 Percent under age 25 21 10 15 18 18 Percent over age 44 39 48 44 41 41 Percent married 47 62 54 51 48 Race/Ethnicity/Ancestry Percent White, not Hispanic 31 65 63 45 59 Percent Black, not Hispanic 3 2 3 3 11 Percent other, not Hispanic 4 6 6 5 11 Percent Hispanic: Mexican origin 54 22 23 40 12 Percent Hispanic: Other 9 4 5 7 8 Percent born in U.S. (includes Puerto Rico) 48 80 77 61 81 Percent U.S. citizens 56 88 85 69 91 Education Percent lacking high school diploma 45 16 16 32 8 Percent with high school diploma (includes equivalency) 34 33 31 33 29 Percent with at least some college 22 51 53 35 63 Note: Counts all private sector wage and salary workers employed in the crop, livestock, and agricultural support industries.

Source: USDA, Economic Research Service analysis of data from U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, American Community Survey, 2021.

Differences in demographics are also evident between crop and livestock workers (not shown in table). A larger share of laborers in crops and related support industries are female (30 percent versus 22 percent in livestock). Crop laborers are also less likely to be non-Hispanic White (25 percent versus 48 percent for livestock), and less likely to have been born in the United States (43 percent for crop workers in manual labor occupations versus 62 percent for manual livestock workers). Finally, crop laborers have lower levels of educational attainment: 50 percent lack a high school degree, compared with 32 percent in livestock.

Notably, the U.S. Department of Labor’s National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS), discussed below, finds larger shares of foreign-born, Hispanic, and less-educated employees among crop and support workers than does the ACS (livestock workers are not surveyed in NAWS). For example, according to NAWS estimates from data spanning fiscal years 2018–20, just 30 percent of crop farm workers in manual labor occupations were U.S. born, compared with 43 percent in the 2021 ACS.

The Hired Farm Workforce Is Aging

As fewer young immigrants are entering agriculture, the average age of foreign-born farmworkers has risen, pulling up the average for the farm workforce as a whole. The average age of immigrant farmworkers rose by 7 years between 2006 and 2021. In contrast, the average age for U.S.-born farmworkers has remained roughly constant over this period.

Women Are an Increasing Share of the Hired Farm Workforce

The share of farmworkers who are women declined in 2006–09, from 20.3 percent to 18.6 percent, but has since climbed to 28.1 percent (in 2021). The fact that the female share fell during the Great Recession and has risen during the recovery is consistent with men moving into agriculture as employment in the nonfarm economy declines, and out of agriculture as nonfarm job prospects improve. The rising female share is also consistent with the fact that, as labor costs rise, some growers are adopting mechanical aids (such as hydraulic platforms that replace ladders in tree-fruit harvesting, and mobile conveyor belts that reduce the distance heavy loads must be carried) which facilitate more women and older workers in performing tasks that traditionally have been performed by younger men.

Geographic Distribution of Hired Farmworkers (By Place of Residence)

According to the 2021 American Community Survey, 70 percent of hired farmworkers reside in counties that are defined as metro (urban). This largely reflects the fact that most of the main farming areas in California, Arizona, and other Western States lie in large counties that also include major cities and thus are defined as metropolitan.

Wages of Hired Farmworkers

According to data from the FLS, real (inflation-adjusted) wages for nonsupervisory crop and livestock workers (excluding contract labor) rose at an average annual rate of 1.1 percent per year between 1990 and 2022. In the past 5 years, however, real farm wages grew at 1.8 percent per year, consistent with growers' reports that workers were harder than usual to find.

In 1990, the average real farm wage for nonsupervisory crop and livestock workers was just over half the average real wage in the nonfarm economy for private-sector nonsupervisory occupations ($11.25 versus $22.27, in 2022 dollars). By 2022, the farm wage ($16.62) was equal to 60 percent of the nonfarm wage ($27.56). In other words, the gap between farm and nonfarm wages is slowly shrinking, but still substantial.

Wages for nonsupervisory occupations varied little across occupations, ranging from $15.95 (for graders and sorters, and for farmworkers in the livestock sector) to $17.59 (for equipment operators). For five out the six nonsupervisory occupations, however, wages were more than 6 percent higher in 2022 than in 2021 (not adjusted for inflation).

Average hourly wages for hired agricultural managers stood at $27.57 in 2022, up 7.9 percent from the year before. Supervisors averaged $24.08 per hour, up 7.5 percent.

Labor Cost Share of Total Gross Revenues

Although farm wages are rising in nominal and real terms, the impact of these rising costs on farmers' incomes has been offset by rising productivity and/or output prices. As a result, labor costs as a share of gross cash income do not show an upward trend for the industry as a whole over the past 20 years. For all farms, labor costs (including contract labor, and cash fringe benefit costs) averaged 10.4 percent of gross cash income during 2018–20, compared with 11.0 percent during 1998–2000.

However, these trends in labor cost shares differ by commodity. Labor cost shares have fallen slightly over the past 20 years for the more labor-intensive fruit and vegetable sectors, although they appear to have been trending upwards again in the past few years. On dairies and in nursery operations, both of which also rely heavily on immigrant labor, labor costs as a share of income are at or near their 20-year highs.

H-2A Temporary Agricultural Program

The H-2A Temporary Agricultural Program—often called the H-2A visa program—provides a legal means to bring foreign-born workers to the United States to perform seasonal farm labor on a temporary basis, for a period of up to 10 months. Crop farmers can use this program to meet their seasonal labor needs, but most livestock producers, such as ranches, dairies, and hog and poultry operations, are not legally allowed to use the program to meet year-round labor needs. An exception to this restriction is made for producers of livestock on the range, such as sheep and goat operations, who can use H-2A workers year-round.

Employers in the H-2A program must demonstrate, and the U.S. Department of Labor must certify, that efforts to recruit U.S. workers were not successful. Employers must also pay a State-specific minimum wage, which may not be lower than the average wage for crop and livestock workers surveyed in the FLS in that region in the prior year, known as the Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR). (See the next section for details on the AEWR.) In addition, employers must provide housing for their H-2A workers and pay for their domestic and international transportation.

One of the clearest indicators of the scarcity of farm labor is the fact that the number of H-2A positions requested and approved has increased more than sevenfold in the past 17 years, from just over 48,000 positions certified in fiscal 2005 to around 371,000 in fiscal year 2022. The average duration of an H-2A certification in fiscal 2022 was 5.65 months, implying that the 371,000 positions certified represented around 175,000 full-year equivalents. A certified job does not necessarily result in the issuance of a visa; in fact, in recent years only about 80 percent of jobs certified as H-2A have resulted in visas. Around 300,000 visas were issued in fiscal 2022 by the Department of State.

Adverse Effect Wage Rate

H-2A employers must provide transportation and housing and pay the higher of the applicable State or federal minimum wage, the prevailing wage in that region and occupation, as determined by the U.S. Department of Labor, or the regional average farm wage observed in the NASS FLS. The latter is known as the Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR), reflecting the legal requirement that H-2A employment should not negatively affect domestic farmworkers by lowering the average wage. For fiscal 2023, this minimum hourly wage ranged from $13.67 (in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina) to $18.65 (in California) and $20.33 (in the District of Columbia).

Legal Status and Migration Practices of Hired Crop Farmworkers

Legal immigration status is difficult to measure: not many surveys ask the question, and unauthorized respondents may be reluctant to answer truthfully if asked. The U.S. Department of Labor’s National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS) provides data on farmworkers’ legal immigration status. NAWS data, believed to be of high quality, is gathered by trained and trusted enumerators who conduct face-to-face interviews with workers at their job sites and with their employers’ permission. NAWS also queries workers on their inter- and intranational migration patterns. One limitation of the NAWS, however, is that it excludes the growing number of H-2A workers, as well as all hired livestock workers.

Roughly Half of Hired Crop Farmworkers Lack Legal Immigration Status

The share of hired crop farmworkers who were not legally authorized to work in the United States grew from roughly 14 percent in 1989–91 to almost 55 percent in 1999–2001; in recent years it has declined to about 40 percent. In 2018–20, 30 percent of crop farmworkers were U.S. born, 6 percent were immigrants who had obtained U.S. citizenship, 23 percent were other authorized immigrants (primarily permanent residents or green-card holders), and the remaining 41 percent held no work authorization. The share of workers who are U.S. born is highest in the Midwest, while the share who are unauthorized is highest in California.

More Farmworkers Are Settled, Fewer Are Migrants

Around 85 percent of hired crop farmworkers are not migrant workers but are considered settled, meaning that they work at a single location within 75 miles of their home. This share is up from 41 percent in 1996–98, reflecting a profound change in the nature of the crop farm workforce.

Among the small share of remaining migrant workers, the largest group is ""shuttlers,"" who work at a single farm location more than 75 miles from home and may cross an international border to get to their worksite. Shuttlers made up about 10 percent of hired crop farmworkers in 2018–20, down from about 24 percent in 1996–98.

More common in the past, the ""follow the crop"" migrant farmworker, who moves from State to State working on different crops as the seasons advance, is now a relative rarity. These workers made up just 3 percent of those surveyed by the NAWS in 2018–20, down from a high of 14 percent in 1992–94.

The final category of hired crop farmworkers is newcomers to farming, whose migration patterns have not yet been established. The fact that they now represent just 1 percent of the crop farm workforce, down from as much as 22 percent in 1998–2000, in part reflecting the slowdown in net migration from Mexico to the United States since 2007.

Links to Key Data Sources

From the U.S. Department of Agriculture:

Farm Labor Survey

The Farm Labor Survey (FLS) conducted by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) is based on semi-annual phone interviews with a random sample of farm employers (crops and livestock) who are asked to provide quarterly data on their wage bill, employment counts, and average weekly hours for all hired workers, by occupation. Contract labor is excluded, and no demographic information on the workforce is collected. Each year, the FLS's estimate of the annual average wage for nonsupervisory field and livestock workers in each of 18 regions is used as the basis for the Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR), which sets a minimum wage for H-2A workers in the following year. The survey is described here, and its quarterly reports are archived here. Data and statistics can also be obtained via NASS Quick Stats.

Census of Agriculture

Every 5 years (years ending in 2 and 7), NASS conducts a full census of every farm in the country. Published statistics include national-, State-, and county-level tables on many topics, including land use and ownership, operator characteristics, production practices, income, and expenditures. Information on total employment (a simple head count, not adjusted for full-year or full-time equivalency) and labor expenditures (including contract labor) is also available. Again, almost no demographic information on the hired farm work force is collected. The Census is described here. Published tables from the 2017 Census are here. Data can also be obtained via NASS Quick Stats.

Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS)

ARMS, jointly sponsored by ERS and NASS, is an annual survey of roughly 30,000 farms that serves as the primary source of information on the financial condition, production practices, and resource use of America's farm businesses and the economic well-being of America's farm households. The field-level phase collects information on production practices and costs (fertilizer, pesticide, labor, tillage, seed, etc.) for target commodities. The farm-level phase collects financial information for farm businesses and a variety of financial and demographic information (age, education, occupation, off-farm income, etc.) for farm operators and their households. The survey collects information from 48 States and is designed to represent the continental United States and to support State-level estimates for 15 key agricultural States. An online web tool permits the creation of various customized reports on farm structure and finance, and crop production practices.

From other agencies:

National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS)

NAWS, conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor, is an employment-based, random-sample survey of U.S. crop workers (neither livestock workers nor seasonal workers on H-2A visas are covered) that collects demographic, employment, and health data in face-to-face interviews. The NAWS is the source of estimates of legal immigration status of the Nation's crop farmworkers and is the basis for much of the research on farmworker health and well-being. is an employment-based, random-sample survey of U.S. crop workers (livestock workers are not covered, nor are seasonal workers on H-2A visas) that collects demographic, employment, and health data in face-to-face interviews. The NAWS is the source of estimates of legal immigration status of the Nation's crop farmworkers, and is the basis for much of the research on farmworker health and well-being. Results are tabulated here, and the underlying microdata files are also available for public use.

Current Population Survey (CPS)

The Census Bureau's CPS interviews about 60,000 households each month, asking detailed questions about demographic characteristics and labor market outcomes. It is the source of the official estimates of the unemployment rate, which are released on the first Friday of every month. Note that this release also contains information on employment levels, derived from a different survey, called the Current Employment Statistics survey, which interviews employers. CPS also serves as the basis for much of the published research on the U.S. labor market. CPS's Annual Social and Economic Supplement, conducted each March, is the source of official statistics on poverty and income distribution. Farmworkers may be identified using industry and occupation codes in the CPS Public Use Microdata (PUMS) files. Results are available at the State level, and for larger metro areas. Results are not generally tabulated for metro versus nonmetro areas, but such tabulations are possible using the microdata files, although for a small number of households, metro status is not reported.

American Community Survey (ACS)

The ACS is a rolling monthly survey that interviews more than 2 million households annually, collecting basic demographic, labor market, and income data. Results are released annually for the nation, for States (with separate tallies for their metropolitan and nonmetropolitan components), and for large metro areas. Information on smaller geographic areas is released only for 5-year averages. Although the income questionnaire is less detailed than CPS, its larger sample size makes the ACS a more reliable measure of income and basic labor market outcomes for smaller geographic regions. Results are accessible using the Census data access site. Farmworkers may be identified using industry and occupation codes in the ACS Public Use Microdata (PUMS) files.

Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)

BEA synthesizes data from multiple sources to provide annual industry employment and earnings estimates at the national, State and county levels. Information on the number of farm proprietors, hired farmworkers, and both self-employed and hired workers in agricultural support services, and their earnings, is reported. Note that BEA's data on self-employment (employment of proprietors) are not comparable to other sources of data on self-employment, because they are not limited to those for whom self-employment is the primary activity.","(1, 'employment/wages')"

These changes will likely add to the economic challenges that many communities already face. Having a climate-resilient economy—one that can withstand or recover quickly from climate impacts in the short and long terms—is essential to a community's long-term well-being.

Starting to plan now with climate and economic resilience in mind will help the community and its businesses protect themselves against short-term shocks such as storms, reduce the need (and cost) to recover from a shock, incorporate economic resilience into other planning efforts, get a jumpstart on pursuing new opportunities that might arise as the climate changes, and might even attract new investment and new businesses.

Many community, business, and government leaders recognize the problem and are calling for action to prepare for and adapt to the potential impacts of a changing climate. However, even with tools to estimate a community's vulnerability to specific climate-related threats, it can be difficult to translate these threats into an economic bottom line and identify ways to become more resilient and take advantage of new opportunities.

To address this gap, EPA worked with the Rhode Island Division of Planning to develop this Planning Framework for a Climate-Resilient Economy (2016) to help communities assess their economic vulnerability to climate change and improve their economic resilience. A pilot community, North Kingstown, Rhode Island, tested and refined the framework.

Steps in the Planning Framework for a Climate-Resilient Economy (click on the image to enlarge)

The framework consists of five basic steps, shown in the figure to the right. It can be adapted by communities anywhere in the country for their context and can be modified to cover small or large geographic areas and their economies.

The framework can help communities ask the right questions to recognize their economic vulnerabilities and identify ways to be more climate resilient, with a focus on helping the business community prepare for and adapt to projected changes and think creatively about ways to prosper in a changing climate.

It is designed to be flexible so communities with varying levels of analytical expertise, time, and funds can use it. Some communities can use it to get a ""big picture"" assessment of their vulnerabilities. Others could use more sophisticated tools such as GIS and other computer-based models and a team of experts to map out specific economic impacts or threats and business opportunities.

70,Public's Top Priority for 2022: Strengthening the Nation's Economy - Pew Research Center,Public's Top Priority for 2022: Strengthening the Nation's Economy  Pew Research Center,"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBld3Jlc2VhcmNoLm9yZy9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDIyLzAyLzE2L3B1YmxpY3MtdG9wLXByaW9yaXR5LWZvci0yMDIyLXN0cmVuZ3RoZW5pbmctdGhlLW5hdGlvbnMtZWNvbm9teS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Pew Research Center,"Dealing with coronavirus has declined as a policy priority, especially among Republicans

How we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand which issues the public views as most important for the president and Congress to prioritize in the coming year. For this analysis, we surveyed 5,128 U.S. adults in January 2022. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology. Here are the questions used for the report, along with responses, and its methodology.

As the coronavirus pandemic enters its third year, more Americans view strengthening the U.S. economy as a top policy priority than say the same about dealing with COVID-19.

This marks a shift from last year, when the economy and the coronavirus both topped the public’s policy agenda.

At a time when Americans rate several issues as lower priorities than they did a year ago, the decline in the share citing the pandemic has been particularly steep: 60% now view dealing with the coronavirus as a top policy priority, down from 78% last year.

Currently, 71% of U.S. adults rate strengthening the economy as a top policy priority, followed by reducing health care costs (61%), addressing the coronavirus (60%), improving education (58%) and securing Social Security (57%) – according to a Pew Research Center survey of 5,128 adults conducted Jan. 10-17, 2022, on the nationally representative American Trends Panel. Smaller shares view seven of the 18 items included in the survey as top policy priorities than did so last year (four items increased).

The public’s policy agenda reflects continued concerns over the economy. With inflation at a four-decade high, large majorities of Americans say prices for food and consumer goods (89%), gas prices (82%) and the cost of housing (79%) are worse than they were a year ago. Only 28% rate economic conditions as excellent or good.

Still, fewer Americans cite strengthening the economy as a top priority than did so in 2021 (71% now vs. 80% then), and there has been a sizable decline in concern about jobs. Only about half of Americans view improving the job situation as a top priority (52%), compared with 67% last year. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, there had been a long-term decline in the shares citing the economy and jobs as top policy priorities.

As in the past, Republicans and Democrats differ on the importance of most policy priorities, but the partisan gaps have widened significantly for 11 of the 18 items included in the survey – including double-digit increases in partisan differences on dealing with immigration, improving the political system, improving the job situation and addressing issues within the criminal justice system.

Among those items that rank near the bottom on the 18-item priorities list today are addressing issues around race (37% top priority), strengthening the military (also 37%), dealing with global trade (35%) and dealing with drug addiction (31%). Notably, majorities rate all of these policy goals either as a “top priority” for the president and Congress or as “an important but lower priority”; for each, relatively small shares say they are “not too important” or “should not be done.” (For a closer look at the top policy priorities of partisan and demographic groups, see the detailed tables accompanying this report).

Changing public priorities: Economy, coronavirus, jobs

While the economy continues to lead the public’s list of priorities, there has been a decline in the share of Americans, especially Democrats, who view it as a top policy priority. The share of Democrats and independents who lean toward the Democratic Party who say strengthening the economy should be a top priority has fallen from 75% a year ago to 63% today.

By contrast, there has been almost no change in views among Republicans and GOP leaners (85% top priority then, 82% today).

Democrats also are less likely to rate improving the job situation as a top priority than they did last January, before President Joe Biden took office. Last year, 71% of Democrats said jobs should be a top priority; today, only about half of Democrats say this (49%). The decline has been more modest among Republicans (from 63% to 55%).

Dealing with the coronavirus outbreak is viewed as a less important priority than last year. A year ago, 78% of the public said it was a top priority; today, that share has fallen to 60%. The decline is steeper among Republicans than Democrats – 60% said the pandemic was a top priority a year ago compared with 35% today – but fewer Democrats also still view it as a major priority (93% last year, 80% now).

Republicans are more likely to rate dealing with immigration and reducing the budget deficit as top priorities than did so last year, while there has been little change in views on the importance of these issues among Democrats.

A year ago, identical shares of Republicans and Democrats (39% each) said dealing with the issue of immigration should be a top priority. Today, two-thirds of Republicans (67%) view immigration as a top priority, compared with just 35% of Democrats.

The share of Republicans who prioritize reducing the budget deficit also increased from 54% to 63%, while holding stable among Democrats (29% then vs. 31% now).

Other issues have declined as policy priorities among members of both parties since last year. The share of Americans who say addressing issues around race should be a top priority for the president and Congress has fallen from 49% to 37%. Currently, 53% of Democrats say addressing issues around race should be a top priority, compared with 72% who said the same last year. Among Republicans, who were far less likely than Democrats to rate this as a priority, there has been a 10 percentage point decline in the share rating it as a top priority (24% to 14%).

Dealing with the problems of poor people has declined as a policy priority as well. Both Republicans (25% now vs. 35% in 2021) and Democrats (58% now vs. 68% then) are now less likely to see dealing with the problems low-income families face as a top priority – though Democrats continue to prioritize this policy area far more than Republicans.

There also has been a decline in the share of the public saying that improving the political system should be a top policy priority, largely driven by Republicans. Last year, there was essentially no difference between the shares in each party who viewed improving the political system as a top priority (64% of Democrats and 60% of Republicans). Now, just 40% in the GOP say this should be a top priority, compared with 61% of Democrats.

Widest partisan gaps on addressing climate change and the coronavirus

While there are wide partisan differences on most priorities, 82% of Republicans and a smaller majority of Democrats (63%) say strengthening the economy should be a top priority for the president and Congress. Among 18 items, the economy is by far the leading priority among Republicans and is among the leading priorities for Democrats.

Comparable shares in both parties also say taking steps to make the Social Security system financially sound (58% of Republicans, 56% of Democrats) and dealing with drug addiction (32% of Democrats, 27% of Republicans) should be top priorities.

On most other issues, however, there are substantial partisan differences – especially on dealing with global climate change and the coronavirus outbreak. Large majorities of Democrats say both should be top priorities (80% coronavirus, 65% climate change) compared with just 35% and 11% of Republicans, respectively.

Beyond the economy, Republicans say the president and Congress should prioritize dealing with immigration (67%), defending against terrorism (65%), reducing the budget deficit (63%) and reducing crime (60%).

Republicans are, on average, about 25 points more likely than Democrats to say each of these issues should be at the top of the national policy agenda.

In addition to strengthening the economy, Democrats’ leading priorities are dealing with the coronavirus (80%), reducing health care costs (69%), improving education (66%) and dealing with global climate change (65%). These issues are far less salient for Republicans: Democrats are on average about 33 points more likely than Republicans to rate each as a top priority.

Policy priorities of Black, Hispanic and White Americans

Across racial and ethnic lines, strengthening the economy ranks near the top of the policy agenda. About seven-in-ten White (72%), Black (69%) and Hispanic (70%) adults say this should be a top priority this year.

But there are significant differences in the importance of a number of other issues, especially addressing issues around race, dealing with the problems of poor people and addressing the criminal justice system.

Black adults (66%) are more likely than either White (27%) or Hispanic adults (47%) to say that addressing issues around race should be a top priority.

In addition, about two-thirds of Black adults say dealing with the problems associated with poverty (68%) and criminal justice reform (67%) should get top priority this year, compared with around four-in-ten White adults who say this for both issues. Hispanic Americans express views closer to Black adults on dealing with poverty (55% of Hispanic adults say it should be top priority), but their views are closer to those of White adults on criminal justice reform (48%).

Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, Black adults are more likely than White or Hispanic adults to rate a number of issues as top policy priorities.

For example, 70% of Black Democrats rate reducing crime as a top priority, compared with 56% of Hispanic Democrats and just 34% of White Democrats. Black Democrats (71%) also are almost twice as like as White Democrats (38%) to say that addressing the criminal justice system should be a top priority; 53% of Hispanic Democrats see this as a major priority.

Dealing with climate change is the only issue which White Democrats (68%) are more likely than Black Democrats (58%) to view as a top priority.

Age and policy priorities

There are wide age differences in views of policy priorities, with older adults more likely than younger people to rate several policy priorities as more important.

There are some exceptions to this pattern, however. For example, adults under 30 (54%) are more likely to say global climate change should be a top priority than older age groups.

The widest gaps between older and younger adults are on strengthening the military and defending against terrorism. About half of adults ages 50 and older (52%) say that strengthening the military should be a top priority. Just 10% of adults under age 30 say the same. Similarly, about three-quarters of adults ages 65 and older say that defending against terrorism should be a top priority, compared with about a third of those under 30. Within both parties, older Americans are more likely to prioritize defense issues (see detailed tables).

Older adults are also more likely than younger adults to prioritize dealing with immigration, securing Social Security and strengthening the economy.

While the share of the public who says that dealing with the coronavirus outbreak should be a top priority has fallen in the last year, this decline is larger among younger Americans.

A year ago, three-quarters of adults under 50 said dealing with the coronavirus should be a top priority; today, about half (54%) say the same. There has been a similar decline among adults ages 50 to 64 who view COVID-19 as a top priority (80% in 2021, 61% today).

Older Americans are only somewhat less likely to say that dealing with the pandemic should be a top priority (80% a year ago, 72% today).

While there is a large partisan gap in views of the coronavirus as a top priority, there are also age differences within each party. Older adults in each party are generally more likely to prioritize the coronavirus than younger ones.

Today, Republicans across all ages are at least 20 points less likely than they were a year ago to say that dealing with the coronavirus outbreak should be a top priority. However, Republicans ages 65 and older are somewhat more likely to rate dealing with the coronavirus as a top goal than Republicans under 65 (44% vs. 32%).

While overwhelming majorities of Democrats ages 65 and older are as likely to say that dealing with the coronavirus should be a top priority as they were a year ago, younger Democrats are less likely to say this over the same timespan. Democrats under 50 are 17 points less likely to rate dealing with COVID-19 as a top priority (90% then, 73% now) and Democrats ages 50 to 64 are 14 points less likely to say this (99% then, 85% now).

Gender and policy priorities

Women place a higher priority than men on several policy goals, especially around the coronavirus and dealing with the problems of poor people.

Nearly two-thirds of women (65%) say that dealing with the coronavirus outbreak should be a top priority for the president and Congress this year. A smaller share of men (54%) say the same.

About half of women also say that dealing with the issue of poverty should be a top priority, while men are 10 points less likely to say this.

Larger shares of women than men also say reducing health care costs, improving education, addressing issues around race and dealing with drug addiction should be top priorities in the year ahead.

There are three topics – dealing with global trade issues, reducing the budget deficit and dealing with immigration – that men view as higher priorities than do women.

Education and policy priorities

There are substantial differences in views of policy priorities by education. Adults who do not have a four-year college degree are more likely to view several goals as top policy priorities.

Roughly four-in-ten Americans without a college degree (42%) say that strengthening the military should be a top priority, compared with about a quarter (26%) of those with a college degree.

Similarly, nearly two-thirds of those without a college degree (63%) say securing Social Security should be a top priority for the president and Congress. Less than half of those with a college degree (44%) say that issue should be a top priority.

Adults with less formal education are also more likely to prioritize many of these issues as top priorities, such as defending against terrorism, reducing crime, dealing with drug addiction, improving the job situation and reducing the budget deficit.

There are two issues – dealing with the coronavirus outbreak and dealing with climate change – where those with more formal education are more likely to say this issue should be a top priority.","(4, 'national debt')"

Beyond the suffering and humanitarian crisis from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the entire global economy will feel the effects of slower growth and faster inflation.

Impacts will flow through three main channels. One, higher prices for commodities like food and energy will push up inflation further, in turn eroding the value of incomes and weighing on demand. Two, neighboring economies in particular will grapple with disrupted trade, supply chains, and remittances as well as an historic surge in refugee flows. And three, reduced business confidence and higher investor uncertainty will weigh on asset prices, tightening financial conditions and potentially spurring capital outflows from emerging markets.

Russia and Ukraine are major commodities producers, and disruptions have caused global prices to soar, especially for oil and natural gas. Food costs have jumped, with wheat, for which Ukraine and Russia make up 30 percent of global exports, reaching a record.

Beyond global spillovers, countries with direct trade, tourism, and financial exposures will feel additional pressures. Economies reliant on oil imports will see wider fiscal and trade deficits and more inflation pressure, though some exporters such as those in the Middle East and Africa may benefit from higher prices.

Steeper price increases for food and fuel may spur a greater risk of unrest in some regions, from Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America to the Caucasus and Central Asia, while food insecurity is likely to further increase in parts of Africa and the Middle East.

Gauging these reverberations is hard, but we already see our growth forecasts as likely to be revised down next month when we will offer a fuller picture in our World Economic Outlook and regional assessments.

Longer term, the war may fundamentally alter the global economic and geopolitical order should energy trade shift, supply chains reconfigure, payment networks fragment, and countries rethink reserve currency holdings. Increased geopolitical tension further raises risks of economic fragmentation, especially for trade and technology.

Europe

The toll is already immense in Ukraine. Unprecedented sanctions on Russia will impair financial intermediation and trade, inevitably causing a deep recession there. The ruble’s depreciation is fueling inflation, further diminishing living standards for the population.

Energy is the main spillover channel for Europe as Russia is a critical source of natural gas imports. Wider supply-chain disruptions may also be consequential. These effects will fuel inflation and slow the recovery from the pandemic. Eastern Europe will see rising financing costs and a refugee surge. It has absorbed most of the 3 million people who recently fled Ukraine, United Nations data show.

European governments also may confront fiscal pressures from additional spending on energy security and defense budgets.

While foreign exposures to plunging Russian assets are modest by global standards, pressures on emerging markets may grow should investors seek safer havens. Similarly, most European banks have modest and manageable direct exposures to Russia.

Caucasus and Central Asia

Beyond Europe, these neighboring nations will feel greater consequences from Russia’s recession and the sanctions. Close trade and payment-system links will curb trade, remittances, investment, and tourism, adversely affecting economic growth, inflation, and external and fiscal accounts.

While commodity exporters should benefit from higher international prices, they face the risk of reduced energy exports if sanctions extend to pipelines through Russia.

Middle East and North Africa

Major ripple effects from higher food and energy prices and tighter global financial conditions are likely. Egypt, for example, imports about 80 percent of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine. And, as a popular tourist destination for both, it will also see visitor spending shrink.

Policies to contain inflation, such as raising government subsidies, could pressure already weak fiscal accounts. In addition, worsening external financing conditions may spur capital outflows and add to growth headwinds for countries with elevated debt levels and large financing needs.

Rising prices may raise social tensions in some countries, such as those with weak social safety nets, few job opportunities, limited fiscal space, and unpopular governments.

Sub-Saharan Africa

Just as the continent was gradually recovering from the pandemic, this crisis threatens that progress. Many countries in the region are particularly vulnerable to the war’s effects, specifically because of higher energy and food prices, reduced tourism, and potential difficulty accessing international capital markets.

The conflict comes when most countries have minimal policy space to counter the effects of the shock. This is likely to intensify socio-economic pressures, public debt vulnerability, and scarring from the pandemic that was already confronting millions of households and businesses.

Record wheat prices are particularly concerning for a region that imports around 85 percent of its supplies, one-third of which comes from Russia or Ukraine.

Western Hemisphere

Food and energy prices are the main channel for spillovers, which will be substantial in some cases. High commodity prices are likely to significantly quicken inflation for Latin America and the Caribbean, which already faces an 8 percent average annual rate across five of the largest economies: Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Peru. Central banks may have to further defend inflation-fighting credibility.

Growth effects of costly commodities vary. Higher oil prices hurt Central American and Caribbean importers, while exporters of oil, copper, iron ore, corn, wheat, and metals can charge more for their products and mitigate the impact on growth.

Financial conditions remain relatively favorable, but intensifying conflict may cause global financial distress that, with tighter domestic monetary policy, will weigh on growth.

The United States has few ties to Ukraine and Russia, diluting direct effects, but inflation was already at a four-decade high before the war boosted commodity prices. That means prices may keep rising as the Federal Reserve starts raising interest rates.

Asia and the Pacific

Spillovers from Russia are likely limited given the lack of close economic ties, but slower growth in Europe and the global economy will take a heavy toll on major exporters.

The biggest effects on current accounts will be in the petroleum importers of ASEAN economies, India, and frontier economies including some Pacific Islands. This could be amplified by declining tourism for nations reliant on Russian visits.

For China, immediate effects should be smaller because fiscal stimulus will support this year’s 5.5 percent growth goal and Russia buys a relatively small amount of its exports. Still, commodity prices and weakening demand in big export markets add to challenges.

Spillovers are similar for Japan and Korea, where new oil subsidies may ease impacts. Higher energy prices will raise India’s inflation, already at the top of the central bank’s target range.

Asia’s food-price pressures should be eased by local production and more reliance on rice than wheat. Costly food and energy imports will boost consumer prices, though subsidies and price caps for fuel, food and fertilizer may ease the immediate impact—but with fiscal costs.

Global Shocks

The consequences of Russia’s war on Ukraine have already shaken not just those nations but also the region and the world, and point to the importance of a global safety net and regional arrangements in place to buffer economies.

“We live in a more shock-prone world,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva recently told reporters at a briefing in Washington. “And we need the strength of the collective to deal with shocks to come.”

While some effects may not fully come into focus for many years, there are already clear signs that the war and resulting jump in costs for essential commodities will make it harder for policymakers in some countries to strike the delicate balance between containing inflation and supporting the economic recovery from the pandemic.","(3, 'inflation')"
74,"Asia Continues to Fuel Global Growth, but Economic Momentum is Slowing - International Monetary Fund","Asia Continues to Fuel Global Growth, but Economic Momentum is Slowing  International Monetary Fund","Fri, 13 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltZi5vcmcvZW4vQmxvZ3MvQXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyMy8xMC8xMy9hc2lhLWNvbnRpbnVlcy10by1mdWVsLWdsb2JhbC1ncm93dGgtYnV0LWVjb25vbWljLW1vbWVudHVtLWlzLXNsb3dpbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,International Monetary Fund,"Strong consumer spending has supported growth in Asia’s three largest economies this year, but there are already signs that the region’s recovery may be running out of steam.

We expect growth in Asia and the Pacific to accelerate from 3.9 percent in 2022 to 4.6 percent this year, unchanged from the projection from last April. This is largely explained by the post-reopening recovery in China and stronger-than-expected growth in the first half of the year in Japan and India. With pandemic restrictions lifted, demand in these economies was bolstered by consumers running down savings accumulated during the pandemic, leading to notable strength in the services sector.

While Asia is still set to contribute about two-thirds of all global growth this year, it is important to note that growth is significantly lower than what was projected before the pandemic and output has been set back by a series of global shocks.

We have lowered our estimate for growth next year to 4.2 percent, from the 4.4 percent projected in April. Our less-optimistic assessment is based on signs of slowing growth and investment in the third quarter, in part reflecting weaker external demand as the global economy slows, such as in Southeast Asia and Japan, and faltering real estate investment in China.

The economic boost that China enjoyed after its re-opening is now losing momentum earlier than previously expected. While we project the rebound will underpin growth quickening to 5 percent this year, the economy would slow to 4.2 percent next year amid the deepening property-sector slump, down from the 4.5 percent we had forecast in April.

The drag from China would historically have been offset by forecasts for faster growth in the United States and Japan, but the resulting boost is likely to be more muted this time. The strength of the US economy has been focused in the service sector, rather than in goods, which doesn’t fuel greater demand for Asia. And US policies such as the Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS and Science Act are re-orienting demand toward domestic sources rather than foreign, providing a smaller boost to imports from Asia.

In the near term, the sharp adjustment in China’s heavily indebted property sector and the resulting slowdown in economic activity will likely spill over to the region, particularly to commodity exporters with close trade links to China. Beyond this, an aging population and slowing productivity growth will further temper growth over the medium-term in China, amid rising risks of geoeconomic fragmentation, and bear upon prospects in the rest of Asia and beyond. In a downside scenario where “de-risking” and “re-shoring” strategies take hold, output could decline by up to 10 percent over five years in the Asian economies most closely linked to China’s economy.

A welcome development is that disinflation is on track in Asia, with inflation now expected to return to central bank target ranges next year in most countries. This process is well ahead of most other regions, where inflation remains high and is expected fall within target only in 2025.

As we described in a 2021 blog post , the post-pandemic inflation surge had divergent effects across Asia—a topic we revisit in-depth in our forthcoming Regional Economic Outlook. Some countries such as Indonesia have already brought overall and core inflation back to target after substantial increases last year. In contrast, inflation in China is below target and—with demand sluggish amid deepening stress emanating from the property sector—is expected to rise only gradually due to policy stimulus.

Inflation has risen in Japan, where the central bank has twice tweaked its yield curve control policy settings to manage risks to the outlook. Given the large participation of Japanese investors in global markets, we find that these policy actions led to spillovers in other bond markets. These could become larger in the event of a more substantial normalization of monetary policy in the region’s second-largest economy.

The global environment remains highly uncertain, and while risks to the outlook are more balanced than they were six months ago, Asia’s policymakers must stay the course to ensure continued growth and stability. On the downside, a more protracted real estate crisis and limited policy response in China would deepen the regional slowdown. And a sudden tightening of global financial conditions could lead to capital outflows and put pressure on Asia’s exchange rates that would threaten the disinflation process.

Countries with inflation still above targets, such as Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines, should continue to signal a commitment to reducing inflation. This will entail maintaining restrictive monetary policy until inflation durably falls to target and expectations are firmly re-anchored.

In many of the region’s emerging market and developing economies, including Indonesia and Thailand, financial conditions have remained relatively accommodative and real policy rates remain close to neutral levels, reducing the need for an early loosening of monetary policy.

Where tight monetary conditions are straining financial stability—including through the real estate sector and heavily indebted companies —supervisors must monitor systemic risks closely. And with public debt still high across most of the region, the ongoing gradual fiscal consolidation should continue to build room for maneuver and to ensure debt sustainability. For those emerging market and developing economies like Sri Lanka that are suffering from funding stress on external markets, faster and more efficient coordination on debt resolution is needed.

As long-term prospects dim, countries must redouble their efforts to advance growth-enhancing reforms. Raising government revenue ratios from low levels would allow for additional spending on important needs such as education and infrastructure, while keeping public debt in check. Finally, strengthening multilateral and regional cooperation and mitigating the effects of geoeconomic fragmentation are increasingly vital for Asia’s economic outlook in coming years. To that end, reforms that lower nontariff trade barriers, boost connectivity, and improve business environments are essential to attract more foreign and domestic investment across the region.","(0, 'GDP')"

China’s reopened economy is rebounding strongly. Supply chain disruptions are unwinding, while dislocations to energy and food markets caused by the war are receding. Simultaneously, the massive and synchronized tightening of monetary policy by most central banks should start to bear fruit, with inflation moving back towards targets.

We forecast in our latest World Economic Outlook that growth will bottom out at 2.8 percent this year before rising modestly to 3 percent next year—0.1 percentage points below our January projections. Global inflation will fall, though more slowly than initially anticipated, from 8.7 percent last year to 7 percent this year and 4.9 percent in 2024.

This year’s economic slowdown is concentrated in advanced economies, especially the euro area and the United Kingdom, where growth is expected to fall to 0.8 percent and -0.3 percent this year before rebounding to 1.4 and 1 percent respectively. By contrast, despite a 0.5 percentage point downward revision, many emerging market and developing economies are picking up, with year-end to year-end growth accelerating to 4.5 percent in 2023 from 2.8 percent in 2022.

Risks

Recent banking instability reminds us, however, that the situation remains fragile. Once again, downside risks dominate and the fog around the world economic outlook has thickened.

First, inflation is much stickier than anticipated, even a few months ago. While global inflation has declined, that reflects mostly the sharp reversal in energy and food prices. But core inflation, which excludes energy and food, has not yet peaked in many countries. We expect year-end to year-end core inflation will slow to 5.1 percent this year, a sizeable upward revision of 0.6 percentage points from our January update, and well above target.

Moreover, activity shows signs of resilience as labor markets remain very strong in most advanced economies. At this point in the tightening cycle, we would expect to see more signs of output and employment softening. Instead, our output and inflation estimates have been revised upwards for the last two quarters, suggesting stronger-than-expected aggregate demand. This may call for monetary policy to tighten further or to stay tighter for longer than currently anticipated.

Should we worry about the risk of an uncontrolled wage-price spiral? At this point, I remain unconvinced. Nominal wage gains continue to lag price increases, implying a decline in real wages. Somewhat paradoxically, this is happening while labor demand is very strong, with firms posting many vacancies, and while labor supply remains weak— many workers have not fully rejoined the labor force after the pandemic. This suggests real wages should increase, and I expect they will. But corporate margins have surged in recent years—this is the flip side of steeply higher prices but only modestly higher wages—and should be able to absorb much of the rising labor costs, on average. Provided inflation expectations remain well-anchored, that process should not spin out of control. It may well, however, take longer than anticipated.

It was never going to be an easy ride

More worrisome are the side effects that the sharp monetary policy tightening of the last year is starting to have on the financial sector, as we have repeatedly warned might happen. Perhaps the surprise is that it took so long.

Following a prolonged period of muted inflation and low interest rates, the financial sector had become too complacent about maturity and liquidity mismatches. Last year’s rapid tightening of monetary policy triggered sizable losses on long-term fixed-income assets and raised funding costs.

The stability of any financial system hinges on its ability to absorb losses without recourse to taxpayers’ money. The brief instability in the United Kingdom’s gilt market last fall and the recent banking turbulence in the United States underscore that significant vulnerabilities exist both among banks and nonbank financial intermediaries. In both cases, financial and monetary authorities took quick and strong action and, so far, have prevented further instability.

Our World Economic Outlook explores a scenario where banks, faced with rising funding costs and the need to act more prudently, cut down lending further. This leads to an additional 0.3 percent reduction in output this year.

Yet, the financial system may well be tested even more. Nervous investors often look for the next weakest link, as they did with Crédit Suisse, a globally systemic but ailing European bank. Financial institutions with excess leverage, credit risk or interest rate exposure, too much dependence on short-term funding, or located in jurisdictions with limited fiscal space could become the next target. So could countries with weaker perceived fundamentals.

A sharp tightening of global financial conditions—a so-called ‘risk-off’ event—could have a dramatic impact on credit conditions and public finances, especially in emerging market and developing economies. It would precipitate large capital outflows, a sudden increase in risk premia, a dollar appreciation in a rush to safety, and major declines in global activity amid lower confidence, household spending and investment.

In such a severe downside scenario, global growth could slow to 1 percent this year, implying near stagnant income per capita. We estimate the probability of such an outcome at about 15 percent.

We are therefore entering a tricky phase during which economic growth remains lackluster by historical standards, financial risks have risen, yet inflation has not yet decisively turned the corner.

Policies

More than ever, policymakers need a steady hand and clear communication.

With financial instability contained, monetary policy should remain focused on bringing inflation down, but stand ready to quickly adjust to financial developments. A silver lining is that the banking turmoil will help slow aggregate activity as banks curtail lending. In and of itself, this should partially mitigate the need for further monetary tightening to achieve the same policy stance. But any expectation that central banks will prematurely surrender the inflation fight would have the opposite effect: lowering yields, supporting activity beyond what is warranted, and ultimately complicating the task of monetary authorities.

Fiscal policy can also play an active role. By cooling off economic activity, tighter fiscal policy would support monetary policy, allowing real interest rates to return faster to a low natural level. Appropriately designed fiscal consolidation will also help rebuild much needed buffers and help strengthen financial stability. While fiscal policy is turning less expansionary in many countries this year, more could be done to regain fiscal space.

Regulators and supervisors should also act now to ensure remaining financial fragilities don’t morph into a full-blown crisis by strengthening oversight and actively managing market strains. For emerging market and developing economies, this also means ensuring proper access to the Global Financial Safety Net, including the IMF’s precautionary arrangements, access to the US Federal Reserve Foreign and International Monetary Authorities repo facility, or to central bank swap lines, where relevant. Exchange rates should be allowed to adjust as much as possible unless doing so raises financial stability risks or threatens price stability, in line with our Integrated Policy Framework.

Our latest projections also indicate an overall slowdown in medium-term growth forecasts. Five-year ahead growth projections declined steadily from 4.6 percent in 2011 to 3 percent in 2023. Some of this decline reflects the growth slowdown of previously rapidly growing economies such as China or Korea. This is predictable: growth slows down as countries converge. But some of the more recent slowdown may also reflect more ominous forces: the scarring impact of the pandemic, a slower pace of structural reforms, as well as the rising and increasingly real threat of geoeconomic fragmentation leading to more trade tensions, less direct investment and a slower pace of innovation and technology adoption across fragmented ‘blocks.’ A fragmented world is unlikely to achieve progress for all, or to successfully tackle global challenges such as climate change or pandemic preparedness. We must avoid that path at all costs.

Progress, however, is slow to come and shocks, such as health and climate disasters, social unrest, and war continue to worsen gender inequality by directly affecting women’s lives and livelihoods or keeping them out of school and work.

Appropriate economic and financial policies can help change these negative outcomes, improving economies by supporting the recovery and building resilience against future shocks. A dividend for women, in other words, is a dividend for all. For instance, while the pandemic set women further back everywhere, it also drove policy innovations. Several extraordinary pandemic assistance programs targeted women and brought more people into social safety nets. The latter makes it easier to provide targeted assistance to cope with the current food and fuel price spikes.

For policymakers, there are well-proven solutions to adopt gender-sensitive macroeconomic actions.

First, step up investment in women’s human capital. The gains from providing women equal access to food, healthcare, and education are especially large in emerging and developing economies. Think of cash transfers that help families afford the basics in countries with less developed social safety nets.

Brazil introduced the Emergency Aid cash transfer program early in the pandemic, which provided double the benefits to women-led households. IMF staff estimates show that the poverty rate among such households would have increased from 11 percent to more than 30 percent without Emergency Aid; instead, it fell to about 8 percent. And Egypt recently expanded cash assistance to low-income single mothers helping them keep their children healthy and in school. In Togo, mobile technology helped expedite emergency financial support during the pandemic, especially benefitting women.

The second confirmed solution is enabling women to work outside the home or start their businesses . Reforms to taxation, public spending, financial infrastructure and regulations, as well as labor markets can help . Providing access to quality and affordable childcare frees up more women to work and also creates jobs directly.

In Norway, the expansion of universal childcare increased the likelihood of mothers’ employment by 32 percentage points. In emerging and developing economies, access to mobile phones and the internet opens the door to economic opportunity. For instance, IMF research shows that traditional and digital finance is helping close the gender gap in access to financial services, including microlending—resulting in lower income inequality and higher growth.

A third area to tackle is biases . Out of 190 countries surveyed, the World Bank found that women were on equal legal standing with men in just 12 countries. Gender-based discrimination in social institutions costs the world economy $6 trillion according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. But in recent years, countries have reduced these costs through social and legal actions such as curbing underage marriage, criminalizing domestic violence, and increasing the number of female elected officials.

Fourth, increasing the representation of women in leadership positions is also critical . IMF analysis shows that a greater presence of women in financial institutions and financial policymaking goes hand in hand with greater financial resilience. And in fintech firms and the corporate sector, more women in leadership is associated with better performance and profitability, respectively.

The IMF’s Gender Strategy

The IMF has supported members in deploying and improving gender policies for a number of years. And recently, our Executive Board approved the first comprehensive IMF Strategy for Mainstreaming Gender to help our members adapt pro-gender equality policies to their unique circumstances.

The strategy recognizes that macroeconomic and financial policies affect women and men differently, often unintentionally. We are helping policymakers identify and remedy these biases by applying a gender lens to our main activities—from our regular country policy surveillance to how we design and implement programs to our capacity development support.

We have supported increased spending on women in our program countries. For example, Egypt expanded pre-school availability and improved the safety of public transport under an IMF-supported program, helping women get to jobs. And São Tomé and Príncipe, with the support of an IMF program, launched an initiative on gender budgeting—the use of fiscal policies and institutions to promote women’s equality across government programs. We also quantified the productivity benefits of getting more girls into high school in Senegal and other countries.

Under the new strategy, the Fund will work in the years ahead with our 190 members and external partners to expand both the breadth of our policy recommendations and bring greater rigor in our analysis to help more countries tailor and deploy policies that support gender equality.

Over time, gender-sensitive macroeconomic and financial policies will result in higher growth, greater economic stability and resilience, and lower income inequality—a dividend not just for women, but for everyone.","(0, 'GDP')"

A New Generation of Labels for a New Generation of Vehicles

In 2012, EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) unveiled the most dramatic overhaul to vehicle fuel economy labels since they were introduced more than 35 years ago.

Car buyers now have more information than ever before-- including fuel economy, fuel costs, and environmental impacts such as smog and greenhouse gas ratings-- for all new vehicles, including advanced technologies such as electric cars and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs).

So you can now make comparisons – car by car – to save on fuel costs and reduce your emissions!



The redesigned label includes: How much you'll save or spend on fuel over the next five years, compared to the average new vehicle

Ratings on a vehicle's smog and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions

Driving range and charging time for electric vehicles

Looking to Sell a Used Car? We Have a Label for That, Too

The benefits of a vehicle fuel economy and environment label now extend to the used car market, too. If you are selling a car or truck, you can print or download a used vehicle label on fueleconomy.gov, making it easy for you to provide fuel economy and CO 2 information for your vehicle. The web-tool allows you to easily search by model year, make, model, engine, and transmission options to find the appropriate vehicle.

http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/UsedCarLabel.jsp

The used vehicle label displays:

the fuel economy and CO 2 grams per mile;

grams per mile; a stock photo of the vehicle; and

a QR code that shoppers can scan with a smartphone to personalize the fuel economy information with their annual mileage, percent of driving in the city, and current fuel prices.

The electronic label graphic can be downloaded and included in online advertisements on the web, while the paper label can be printed and affixed to the vehicle window. As a vehicle’s fuel economy changes very little over a typical 15-year life with proper maintenance, the original EPA fuel economy estimate remains the best indicator of a used vehicle’s average gas mileage.

U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service. (2024, February 7). Farm Sector Income & Finances: Farm Sector Income Forecast.

Farm sector income is forecast to continue to fall in 2024 after reaching record highs in 2022. Net farm income, a broad measure of profits, reached $185.5 billion in calendar year 2022 in nominal dollars. After decreasing by $29.7 billion (16.0 percent) from 2022 to a forecast $155.9 billion in 2023, net farm income in 2024 is forecast to decrease further from the 2023 level by $39.8 billion (25.5 percent) to $116.1 billion. Net cash farm income reached $202.3 billion in 2022. After decreasing by $41.8 billion (20.7 percent) from 2022 to a forecast $160.4 billion in 2023, net cash farm income is forecast to decrease by $38.7 billion (24.1 percent) to $121.7 billion in 2024.

In inflation-adjusted 2024 dollars, net farm income is forecast to decrease by $43.1 billion (27.1 percent) from 2023 to 2024, and net cash farm income is forecast to decrease by $42.2 billion (25.8 percent) compared with the previous year. If realized, both measures in 2024 would fall below their 2003-22 averages (in inflation-adjusted dollars).

See a summary of the forecasts in the table U.S. farm sector financial indicators, 2017–2024F, or see all data tables on farm income and wealth statistics.

Note: In the text below, year-to-year changes in the major aggregate components of farm income are discussed only in nominal dollars unless the direction of the change is reversed when looking at the component in inflation-adjusted dollars.

Summary Findings

Overall, farm cash receipts are forecast to decrease by $21.2 billion (4.2 percent) from 2023 to $485.5 billion in 2024 in nominal dollars. Total crop receipts are forecast to decrease by $16.7 billion (6.3 percent) from 2023 levels to $245.7 billion following lower receipts for corn and soybeans. Total animal/animal product receipts are projected to decrease by $4.6 billion (1.9 percent) to $239.8 billion in 2024. Receipts for eggs, turkeys, cattle/calves and milk are forecast to fall relative to 2023.

Direct Government farm payments are forecast at $10.2 billion in 2024, a $1.9 billion (15.9 percent) decrease from 2023. Direct Government farm payments include Federal farm program payments paid directly to farmers and ranchers but exclude U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) loans and insurance indemnity payments made by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC). This decline is largely because of lower supplemental and ad hoc disaster assistance to farmers and ranchers in 2024 compared with 2023.

Total production expenses, including those associated with operator dwellings, are forecast to increase by $16.7 billion (3.8 percent) from 2023 to $455.1 billion in 2024. Livestock/poultry purchases and labor expenses are expected to see the largest increases in 2024 while spending on fuels/oils is expected to decline relative to 2023.

Farm sector equity is expected to increase by 4.7 percent ($166.2 billion) from 2023 to $3.74 trillion in 2024 in nominal terms. Farm sector assets are forecast to increase 4.7 percent ($193.2 billion) to $4.28 trillion in 2024 following expected increases in the value of farm real estate assets. Farm sector debt is forecast to increase 5.2 percent ($27.0 billion) to $547.6 billion in 2024. Debt-to-asset levels for the sector are forecast to worsen slightly from 12.73 percent in 2023 to 12.78 percent in 2024. Working capital is forecast to fall 16.6 percent in 2024 relative to 2023.

Total Cash Receipts Forecast to Decline for Second Straight Year in 2024

Total inflation-adjusted cash receipts are forecast to fall $32.2 billion (6.2 percent) from 2023 to $485.5 billion in 2024. Crop cash receipts are projected to decline $22.4 billion (8.3 percent) in 2024. Similarly, animal/animal product cash receipts are expected to decline $9.9 billion (4.0 percent).

Crop Receipts Projected to Fall in 2024

Crop cash receipts are forecast at $245.7 billion in 2024, a decrease of $16.7 billion (6.3 percent) from 2023 in nominal terms. Combined receipts for corn and soybeans are forecast to fall $17.2 billion, although fruit and nut receipts are expected to increase.

Corn receipts are expected to fall by $11.3 billion (14.3 percent), as lower forecasted prices should outweigh higher quantities sold in 2024. Lower prices in 2024 should also outweigh growth in quantities sold for soybean receipts, which are forecast to decrease by $6.0 billion (10.3 percent). Cotton receipts are projected to increase by $0.1 billion (1.6 percent) due to higher quantities sold. Wheat receipts are forecast to decrease $0.1 billion (0.5 percent), as lower prices will outweigh higher quantities sold. Receipts for hay are projected to fall by $0.8 billion (8.3 percent).

Vegetable and melon cash receipts are expected to fall $30 million (0.1 percent) in 2024 while receipts for fruits and nuts are expected to increase $0.8 billion (2.8 percent) during the year. Rice receipts are projected to grow by $0.4 billion (13.1 percent), while receipts for barley are forecast to decline $0.2 billion (16.3 percent). Sugarcane receipts are also forecast to decline $0.2 billion (10.1 percent) in 2024, and sorghum receipts are projected to fall $0.2 billion (17.6 percent).

See data on value of crop production (in the value added table) and crop cash receipts.

Animal/Animal Product Receipts Forecast To Decrease in 2024

Total animal/animal product cash receipts are expected to decrease $4.6 billion (1.9 percent in nominal terms) from 2023 to $239.8 billion in 2024. While receipts for most major animal/animal products are projected to fall, receipts for hogs and broilers are expected to remain relatively unchanged.

Milk receipts are expected to decrease $0.9 billion (2.0 percent) in 2024 due to lower prices. Cash receipts from cattle and calves are expected to decrease $1.6 billion (1.6 percent), as falling quantities sold should outpace growth in prices. Growth in quantities sold should slightly outweigh lower prices for hog receipts, resulting in an increase of $0.3 billion (1.0 percent) in nominal terms during the year, which represents a slight decrease in real terms.

Broiler receipts are expected to increase $0.7 billion (1.6 percent) in 2024, due to higher prices and quantities sold. This nominal increase is a decrease in real terms. Falling prices should drive receipts for turkeys $1.4 billion (21.0 percent) lower during the year. Cash receipts for chicken eggs are expected to decrease $1.7 billion (12.0 percent) in 2024, also due to a lower price forecast.

See data on value of animal/product production (in the value added table) and animal/product cash receipts.

Lower Prices Drive Cash Receipts Decline in 2024

To better understand the factors underlying the forecast change in annual receipts from 2023 to 2024, the change was decomposed into two separate effects: a ""price effect"" projecting the change in cash receipts associated with holding the quantity sold constant at 2023 levels and allowing prices to change to forecast 2024 levels; and a ""quantity effect"" holding prices constant from 2023 and quantities changing to forecast 2024 levels. In 2024, falling prices are projected to have negative effects on cash receipts, while rising quantities sold should have positive effects. Overall, cash receipts are forecast to decrease $21.2 billion in 2024, with an estimated negative price effect of $26.9 billion, and a projected positive quantity effect of $5.1 billion. In addition, a net increase of $0.6 billion in cash receipts is from forecasts for commodities for which price and quantity effects cannot be separately determined. Price effects on cash receipts are forecast to be negative for both crops and animals/animal products. Quantity effects are forecast to be negative overall for animals/animal products but are expected to be positive for crop cash receipts.

Direct Government Farm Payments Forecast to Decrease in 2024

Direct Government farm program payments are those made by the Federal Government directly to farmers and ranchers with no intermediaries. Typically, most direct payments to farmers and ranchers are administered by the USDA using the Farm Bill or related authorities. Direct payments can also come from supplemental programs authorized by the U.S. Congress. Government payments do not include Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) indemnity payments (listed as a separate component of farm income) and USDA loans (listed as a liability in the farm sector’s balance sheet). Direct Government farm program payments are forecast to decrease 15.9 percent ($1.9 billion) from 2023 to 2024. This overall decrease reflects lower anticipated payments from the supplemental and ad hoc disaster assistance mainly from the Emergency Relief Program (ERP).

Supplemental and ad hoc disaster assistance payments in 2024 are forecast at $5.9 billion, a decrease of $1.2 billion (17.4 percent) from 2023, mostly because of lower expected payments from the Emergency Relief Program. Since 2020, supplemental and ad hoc disaster assistance has represented the largest category of direct Government payments.

Conservation payments from the financial assistance programs of USDA's Farm Service Agency and Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) are expected to be $4.0 billion in 2024, an increase of $441.2 million (or 12.3 percent) from the 2023 forecast level. The increase in conservation payments is due to a marginal increase in Conservation Reserve Program enrolled acres, an increase in payments from NRCS programs, and some expected payments from the Inflation Reduction Act funds allocated for USDA’s conservation programs.

The Dairy Margin Coverage Program (DMC) is forecast to make $264.5 million in payments in 2024, which is $0.9 billion lower than 2023. DMC payments were at record high of $1.2 billion in 2023 due to lower milk prices.

Farm bill commodity payments under the Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) and Price Loss Coverage (PLC) programs are forecast to decline in aggregate. The ARC program provides income support payments when actual crop revenue declines below a specified level. ARC payments are expected to be $39.1 million in 2024, a decrease of $231.3 million (85.5 percent) from $270.4 million in 2023. Despite the expected decrease in market prices, commodity prices are likely to remain above the levels needed to trigger significant ARC payments. The PLC program provides income support payments when the effective price of a covered commodity falls below its effective reference price. PLC payments in 2024 are expected to be $40.8 million, an increase of $32.9 million from $7.9 million in 2023. PLC payments are expected to increase in 2024 because of lower expected prices for rice (long-grain), seed cotton, and grain sorghum in 2024 compared with 2023.

See data table on Government payments.

Production Expenses Forecast To Increase in 2024

Farm sector production expenses, including expenses associated with operator dwellings, are forecast at $455.1 billion in 2024. The expenses are forecast to have increased by $9.8 billion (2.3 percent) in 2023, compared with their 2022 level. The expenses are forecast to further increase by $16.7 billion (3.8 percent) in 2024. However, when adjusted for inflation, production expenses are forecast to have decreased by 1.3 percent from 2022 to 2023, and to increase by 1.6 percent from 2023 to 2024.

See data tables on production expenses.

Spending on feed, labor, and livestock/poultry purchases are expected to represent three of the largest categories of spending in 2024. Feed expenses, the largest single expense category, are forecast at $79.9 billion in 2023 and $80.6 billion in 2024, staying below the record-high 2022 level. In turn, labor expenses (including noncash employee compensation) are forecast to have risen by $2.2 billion (5.3 percent) in 2023, reaching $44.1 billion. Labor expenses are forecast to rise by additional $3.3 billion (7.4 percent) to $47.4 billion in 2024, compared with 2023. Livestock and poultry expense is projected to have grown by $6.5 billion (18.8 percent) to $41.1 billion in 2023. The increase is forecast to slow down in 2024, with expected growth of $3.3 billion (8.0 percent), to $44.4 billion.

Three other expense categories are forecast to notably change in 2023 and 2024, compared with their 2022 levels:

Interest expenses (including expense for operator dwellings) are forecast to have significantly increased in nominal terms in 2023, growing by $10.1 billion (41.8 percent above the 2022 value) to $34.2 billion. This reflects both higher total debt levels and interest rates in 2023. In 2024, interest expenses are expected to remain comparable with their 2023 levels, increasing in nominal terms but falling when adjusted for inflation.

Fertilizer expenses (including lime and soil conditioner expenses) are projected to have significantly declined in nominal terms in 2023 from 2022, falling $6.5 billion (17.5 percent) to $30.4 billion, driven by reductions in fertilizer prices. In 2024, the fertilizer expenses are expected to grow by 4.3 percent from their 2023 levels yet remain below 2022 levels (in nominal terms).","(0, 'GDP')"

Enlarge this image toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

The U.S. economy continues to defy gravity.

Data this week showed the economy growing at the fastest pace in nearly two years from July to September. Other reports have also showcased the resilience of the economy.

It's a stunning development, considering that at the beginning of the year, many economists predicted that the economy would tip into a recession as a result of the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes.

So what gives?

Here are five takeaways about today's economy, including why forecasters are cautioning that the strong growth may not last.

The economy's strength has been a surprise

The economy got its latest report card this week — and it was very good.

The U.S. economy grew at an annual pace of 4.9% in the third quarter, according to figures released by the Commerce Department on Thursday.

That was the strongest performance since the final months of 2021 — and more than twice the growth rate of the previous quarter.

""It's a good, strong number, and it shows an economy that's doing very well,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Bloomberg TV.

The economic growth is particularly remarkable given that high interest rates would typically result in slower growth — but not this time.

""The economy is just incredibly resilient, navigating through lots of different headwinds and posting a really boomy-like quarter,"" said Chief Economist Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics.

And it all thanks to the consumer

There's a key reason why growth has been so strong: all of us.

Americans have been opening their pocketbooks in a major way, buying more cars and Taylor Swift concert tickets.

Data on Friday showed spending on goods rose by a healthy 0.7% during September, while spending on services — things like eating out or travel — rose slightly faster.

""Consumers are resilient,"" said Matthew Shay, CEO of the National Retail Federation. ""They're still powering the economy.""

Personal spending is being propped up by a very strong job market, with an unemployment rate below 4% for 20 months in a row.

Workers with paychecks to spend have enabled the economy to withstand speed bumps like falling business investment.

""The consumer is kind of the fire wall between a recession or an economy that keeps on growing,"" said Zandi. ""And that fire wall is hanging tough.""

But inflation still remains higher than desired

It's not all rosy for the economy.

Inflation has fallen by more than half since hitting a four-decade high last year, but prices are still climbing faster than most people were used to before the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

According to the Commerce Department's yardstick, which is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, consumer prices were 3.4% higher in September than a year ago.

That means the Fed is not ready yet to declare victory against inflation.

Forecasters think the central bank will hold rates steady when policymakers meet next week, but the Fed is expected to leave the door open to future rate hikes if necessary to get inflation back down to its target of 2%.

Higher prices are clouding the country's mood

Here's another less encouraging report card: Despite solid GDP growth and low unemployment, many people are unhappy with the economy.

A poll by Gallup this month found that 47% of Americans rate the economy as ""poor,"" while only 19% rate it as ""good"" or ""excellent.""

Gallup's index of economic confidence shows some improvement from last summer, when inflation was at its peak. But high prices grate on people, even as they continue to pay them.

While inflation has come down a lot, many prices are still much higher than they were before the pandemic. Gasoline is no longer $5 a gallon like it was last summer. But it's not $2.60 either, as it was in 2019.

""Unlike GDP that's very abstract, everybody feels the effects of inflation,"" said Lydia Saad, director of U.S. social research at Gallup. ""That creates a real wet blanket on consumer attitudes. That's just probably not going away until we get back to that kind of pre-pandemic normal inflation that people got used to.""

Meanwhile, Zandi at Moody's thinks people are also still scared by the economic upheaval of the last three years.

""We never got our groove back from the pandemic,"" he said. ""People are shellshocked and nervous and skittish.""

And the good economic numbers may not last

The economy is almost certain to cool as higher interest rates for things like home mortgages continue to take a toll. The question is how much the economy will slow.

The Treasury's Yellen said she doesn't expect the economy to keep growing at the blistering pace it did in the third quarter. But she doesn't expect it to shift into reverse, either.

""You don't really see any sign of a recession here,"" Yellen told Bloomberg. ""What we have looks like a soft landing with very good outcomes for the U.S. economy, so I think there's a lot to be pleased about.""

Other forecasters still think a mild recession is on the horizon, once consumer spending falters.

Friday's data showed that spending grew more than incomes in September — a trend that can't continue indefinitely.

""Obviously, you can eat into savings for a while. You can borrow from the credit card for a while,"" said economist Tim Quinlan of Wells Fargo. ""But this is not a sustainable framework for long-term spending growth.""","(0, 'GDP')"
81,Historic $650 Billion Liquidity Boost Continues to Benefit the Global Economy - International Monetary Fund,Historic $650 Billion Liquidity Boost Continues to Benefit the Global Economy  International Monetary Fund,"Tue, 29 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltZi5vcmcvZW4vQmxvZ3MvQXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAyMy8wOC8yOS9oaXN0b3JpYy02NTAtYmlsbGlvbi1saXF1aWRpdHktYm9vc3QtY29udGludWVzLXRvLWJlbmVmaXQtdGhlLWdsb2JhbC1lY29ub2150gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,International Monetary Fund,"In a world shaken by multiple shocks affecting many countries—pandemics, wars, food and energy crises, and climate disasters—the international community has a responsibility to stand together and support the global economy and all its citizens.

One example of such international cooperation has been the IMF’s largest-ever allocation of special drawing rights in August 2021, which injected $650 billion of liquidity into countries to help turn the pandemic crisis toward recovery.

SDRs are unconditional reserve assets issued to member countries at times of stress to safeguard global stability. SDRs can be saved as international reserves, providing a cushion against shocks. These assets can also be exchanged for other currencies and spent, including on vaccines or social assistance for families.

Two years after this historic allocation, our new study shows that it met its objectives by giving member countries a boost and helping the global economy avoid worse outcomes.

Most importantly, the benefits are poised to continue. More than $100 billion of SDRs in pledges announced by the G20 are being channeled from stronger members to vulnerable low-and middle-income countries, amplifying the direct benefits of the allocation.

Our report shows that the SDR allocation benefitted all IMF members, especially low-income countries. Although advanced economies received the bulk of the allocation ($376 billion), when measured in relation to the size of their economies, low-income countries received on average almost double the allocation compared to advanced economies. And low-income countries continue to benefit from the rechanneling of SDRs.

International reserves of low-income countries were bolstered by 23 percent on average (up to 40 percent for sub-Saharan African countries). Some of these countries also used the space provided by the allocation (about 2.4 percent of their annual economic output on average) for crisis-related spending.

Our report also shows that SDRs were used to protect people’s livelihoods and well-being.

Countries generally used SDRs to increase their reserve buffers. As a result, they saw lower borrowing costs. This helped amplify the beneficial effects of the allocation by allowing emerging and developing countries to borrow from markets at lower cost to help meet the urgent needs of their populations.

A number of emerging market economies and low-income countries also used SDRs to finance pressing fiscal needs, including those related to the pandemic, according to the IMF’s SDR Tracker, which collects information on how countries used the resources.

For example, The Gambia dedicated some of its funding to a new ultra-cold storage facility for COVID-19 vaccines, while Senegal used SDRs to support domestic vaccine production and invest in hospitals. North Macedonia used its entire allocation to provide subsidies to vulnerable households and those hit by the pandemic, boost spending on health, vaccines, and finance capital projects. And Paraguay funded its pandemic emergency plan.

Our report suggests that governments generally pursued responsible policies, saving SDRs to protect against future shocks, spending them on critical needs, while not delaying needed adjustment and reforms. They also generally reported transparently on their use of SDRs. Only in some cases were reforms postponed, and the reporting of SDR use by fiscal authorities faced challenges.

While countries that spent SDRs now face higher interest costs, they are still lower than alternative market financing. With higher global interest rates, the total long-term expected costs of using SDRs have more than tripled for the median country since August 2021. Still, interest costs due on the SDR allocation remain significantly below alternative market financing, and should be manageable with sound macroeconomic policies, even if interest rates stay higher for longer.

SDR channeling benefits

Countries with strong balance of payments positions—generally advanced and large emerging market countries—have demonstrated responsibility toward the global community by pledging part of their allocation to support more vulnerable members and standing ready to provide currencies in exchange for SDRs through voluntary trading operations.

As part of the broader channeling effort to support countries since the pandemic, the international community has mobilized pledges of $45 billion for the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust and $42 billion for the Resilience and Sustainability Trust, which are helping low- and middle-income countries address balance-of-payments needs and longer-term structural challenges, such as climate change.

This is essential so that the Fund can continue to provide affordable financing to its poor and vulnerable members. Efforts are also being made to further channel SDRs through multilateral development banks for the benefit of low- and middle-income countries.

Collective responsibility

Responsibility does not stop here. With close to $1 trillion in SDRs allocated to date, the international community has a collective responsibility to evaluate carefully any future decisions to issue SDRs and ensure transparency in the use of such global reserve assets. In particular, at the current juncture, members need to take into account the environment of higher interest and inflation rates, which is making the use of SDRs more costly. Countries must also be prudent, accountable, and transparent in their actions and use of SDRs to help their people.

Stronger economies must continue to amplify the effects of the 2021 allocation by translating their pledges into actual contributions and, as feasible, increasing the ambition of voluntary SDR channeling. This is critical to adequately resource the global financial safety net and support vulnerable countries facing multiple shocks and challenging transitions.

In sum, while an SDR allocation is a very useful and important mechanism to build confidence and strengthen global economic and financial resilience, it is not a silver bullet. It has to be seen as part of a broader range of support measures. This includes those measures that the IMF has deployed and will continue to deploy to support our membership in this shock-prone world, such as our policy advice to countries, financial support, including our contingency facilities, and technical assistance.","(4, 'national debt')"

On her latest tour, Taylor Swift is tapping into the spending power of women who have experienced increased wages coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic and are eager to splurge on travel and seeing their idol live. The singer-songwriter, named by Forbes the second-richest self-made woman in the U.S. music industry, will play more than 140 concerts across five continents in 2023 and 2024.

It is already obvious, however, that Swift’s tour is smashing all sorts of records, Modestino says, in terms of ticket prices, crowds of fans and revenues.

On average, almost 54,000 fans attended each concert on the first American leg of the tour, which concluded Aug. 9 in Inglewood, California. The average ticket price fans paid on Ticketmaster was $254, while resale prices soared to thousands and tens thousands of dollars.

Each Eras show grossed around $13M

Each Eras show grossed around $13 million, according to Bloomberg, bringing Swift more than $300 million after playing the first 22 concerts.

“She writes songs that drive people to tears. That’s incredible and people want that,” says David Herlihy, teaching professor in the undergraduate music industry program and the master of science in music industry leadership program at Northeastern. “So, what are you willing to pay for something that makes you want to weep?”

Herlihy believes that Swift is making more than 100% of the face value of a ticket. Besides concerts, the tour makes money from sponsorships and merchandise sales. Many fans who adore Swift, Herlihy says, want a keepsake that would remind them of the Eras experience, so they buy every available piece of paraphernalia.

Swift’s costs include things like paying for elaborate staging, costumes and venues, compensating the crew, and sharing proceeds with songwriters, and could be about 25 cents on the dollar, Herlihy says, if not more.

She is still making “huge money,” he says, and, according to Forbes, is on her way to beating Elton John, who grossed $939 million on his farewell Yellow Brick Road tour, a world record to date. Predictions are that Swift’s worldwide gross ticket sales will surpass $1 billion.

The power of the Swift supernova is such that her own economic gains also positively affect cities and livelihoods of other people (besides ticket resellers). The inflow of visitors means that they will be spending on hotels, restaurants, taxis, Uber/Lyft rides, hotdog vendors and other businesses.

$140 million in consumer spending

One study estimated that two Swift’s performances in July could boost Colorado’s GDP with $140 million in consumer spending. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia stated that Swift’s tour helped stimulate travel and tourism in the region, making May the strongest month for hotel revenue in the city since the onset of the pandemic.

Chicago’s tourism and conventions bureau announced that the city set a record for occupied hotel rooms in June — nearly 97 percent — thanks in part to the three nights that Swift played at a multi-purpose stadium, Soldier Field. Cincinnati’s economy felt a boost, too, when the singer brought Eras to town. And in Las Vegas, it was Swift’s presence, not gambling, that caused the highest post-pandemic tourism spending.

Fans have been spending more than $1,300 on average on tickets, travel and new outfits for the concert night, according to Fortune. A survey company, QuestionPro, estimated that the Eras tour could generate up to $4.6 billion in consumer spending for the U.S. economy in total.

Swift exists against a contrasting backdrop, Herlihy says. Most talented aspiring artists will never make it big. The music industry, he says, consists of multiple distinctive industries and jobs like music directors, sound technicians, booking agents, broadcasters, journalists, graphic designers, songwriters, publishers, radio stations and record labels. Companies in these vertical industries make money off of artists but rank-and-file workers don’t earn that much money. A crew on a tour largely consists of gig workers and private contractors like catering personnel, roadies and stagehands that might not have the next gig lined up after the tour ends.

Swift flabbergasted everyone at the end of July when she decided to share her profits with her Eras crew, spending $55 million on bonuses for everyone from backup dancers to sound technicians to truck drivers. Such generosity serves as another testament to the singer’s disruptive force, Modestino says.

Semi-trailer truck drivers received $100,000

It was widely reported that each of the hardworking 50-80 semi-trailer truck drivers received $100,000 from Swift, and there might have been a number of motivations behind this gracious gesture, the Northeastern experts say.

“I think that Taylor is doing what she believes to be the right thing and also burnishes her image,” Herlihy says.

Swift was able to give out large bonuses, he says, because she is the one who calls shots in her business empire. She is the CEO of multiple companies that comprise “Taylor Swift Galaxy,” he says, and does not have to answer to a management company or shareholders for her decisions.

Her choices could be mirroring the trend that economists are seeing happening among other employers, Modestino says.

“Profits coming out of COVID are up about 25% for corporations right now, wages are up about 14%,” she says. “So we do see employers sharing some of those profits with their workers.”

The U.S. labor market, at the same time, has been incredibly tight, Modestino says, with the unemployment rate coming down to the lowest number (3.5%) since 1969. Employers are wary of losing workers or laying anyone off because turnover is very costly and they want to make sure that they maintain their labor force.

Turnover in trucking is particularly high, Modestino says, averaging around 55 to 60% and sometimes reaching 100%, largely because most truckers are away from their families for long periods of time. The crew that’s touring with Swift has been away from their families for 24 weeks.

Moreover, there is a massive trucker shortage in North America and some companies have been having difficulties negotiating with the Teamster Union, Modestino says. For example, the 99-year-old trucking company Yellow Corp. shut down operations in July because it failed to reach a deal with the Teamsters union that represents about 22,000 of its workers

Taylor Swift brand cannot allow disruption

The Taylor Swift brand cannot allow any disruption of the tour, says Nada Sanders, distinguished professor of supply chain management at Northeastern. Every concert is a major supply chain management feat, she says, and every piece has to arrive on time.

“You have basically what is like a small city with all these different crews and different categories from catering to various stages to lighting to guitars to microphones and LED screens,” Sanders says. “The issue is that it has to be coordinated. It’s not like bringing them to one event at one time, but it’s also having to coordinate the movement.”

To coordinate the arrival of dozens of semi trucks to one place, such a complex operation relies on real-time metrics from radio-frequency identification and GPS, as well as predictive analytics to estimate when each truck is going to arrive.

“This is in no way, by the way, me being cynical, but she’s going to ensure really great service and people as she moves on to other tours in Europe and South America,” Sanders says.

Will anyone else in the industry match Swift’s generosity? Herlihy sees some entertainers doing it mostly to not seem greedy by comparison.

Modestino says that employers often follow dramatic changes in compensation in the industries that are competing for workers. For example, when Walmart increased the minimum pay to $15 an hour prior to the pandemic, Target and other big-box stores did the same to compete.

“I’ve always been given the advice that when you can be generous, be generous,” she says. “And I think we’re seeing her do that. But it’s also going to make sure that she’s incredibly successful and keeps the show going for as long as she needs to do.”

Story Highlights Gallup's Economic Confidence Index improves to -26, highest since 2022

45% rate economy as poor; 63% say it is getting worse, not better

63% say high prices pose a severe or moderate financial hardship

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- While still negative overall, Gallup’s Economic Confidence Index has improved each of the past two months to its highest point in two years, reflecting improved views of both current economic conditions and the economy’s direction. However, a steady majority of Americans continue to say recent price increases have created financial hardship for them.

Economic Confidence Improves to Highest Level in Two Years, but Still Low

Gallup tracks Americans' monthly ratings of national economic conditions and their views on whether the economy is getting better or worse. The combined responses are used to create the Gallup Economic Confidence Index (ECI), which has a theoretical range of +100 (if all respondents say the economy is excellent or good and that it is getting better) to -100 (if all say it is poor and getting worse).

The latest index score, from a Jan. 2-22 poll, is up by six points from last month and 14 points since November to -26, the highest since January 2022. The index has been in mostly negative territory since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. It fell to -58 in June 2022, marking the worst reading since the Great Recession, as inflation reached its highest point in more than 40 years and gas prices set new records. Since then, it has fluctuated, showing modest signs of improvement last summer before worsening again.

###Embeddable###

The recent uptick in confidence comes at a time when national economic indicators are generally seen as solid or improving. Unemployment remains low, gross domestic product is beating expectations, the inflation rate is down from its high point, and the stock market -- which continues to surge -- hit a new high at the end of the latest poll’s field period.

Americans Slightly More Optimistic About Current Economic Conditions, Outlook

Though still in negative territory, Americans’ views of both components of the ECI -- current conditions and the economy’s trajectory -- have improved modestly.

The largest share of Americans, 45%, rate current economic conditions in the country as poor, while just over one-quarter describe conditions as excellent (5%) or good (22%) and another 29% believe they are only fair. In December, 22% of U.S. adults rated the economy as excellent or good.

###Embeddable###

Currently, 63% of Americans say the economy is getting worse, 30% say it is improving, and 4% think it is staying the same. Last month, 68% of Americans thought the economy was worsening.

###Embeddable###

The latest changes in Americans’ views of the economy and its trajectory are mainly owed to Democrats’ increased positivity. Democrats’ rating of the economy as excellent or good rose from 38% in December to 54% this month. Likewise, the percentage of Democrats saying the economy is getting better increased from 54% to 64% over the same period. At the same time, neither Republicans’ nor independents’ views changed significantly. Few Republicans, 8%, currently rate the economy as excellent or good, while the 21% of independents who offer the same rating is closer to the national average.

Inflation Continues to Affect a Majority of Americans

Despite modest improvements in Americans’ views of the national economic situation, there has been little change in the percentage who characterize recent price increases as a personal hardship.

Data from a nationally representative Jan. 2-16 web survey using Gallup's probability-based panel show 63% of U.S. adults say recent price increases have caused financial hardship for their family. This includes 17% who say it is a severe hardship affecting their ability to maintain their standard of living and 46% who report it is a moderate hardship but does not jeopardize their standard of living. Another 37% of Americans say inflation is not a hardship at all.

The current 63% saying rising prices are a personal hardship reflects a continuation of peak concern on this measure since Gallup started monitoring it in November 2021. In that initial reading, 45% reported a severe or moderate hardship. The rate inched up in 2022 even as inflation ebbed, perhaps reflecting the cumulative effect of higher prices rather than the rate itself.

###Embeddable###

Inflation’s Impact ‘Severe’ for Three in 10 Lower-Income Households

As has been the case in previous readings, Americans’ reports of high prices as a hardship have differed significantly based on annual household income. Those in lower-income households (76%) are more likely than those in middle-income households (64%) and higher-income households (54%) to say price increases are causing them hardship. However, income differences are even more pronounced when looking just at those saying the impact is severe. Lower-income Americans (30%) are three times as likely as high-income adults (10%) and almost twice as likely as middle-income adults (16%) to characterize high prices as a severe hardship.

Americans’ reports of the effects of high prices also differ significantly by party, with Republicans and independents describing the situation more negatively than Democrats. In all, 72% of Republicans and 64% of independents say inflation has been a hardship for them, compared with 51% of Democrats.

Bottom Line

As the presidential election year gets underway, Americans -- primarily Democrats -- are feeling more optimistic about the economy even as they are still feeling the sting of higher prices. The uptick in economic confidence coincides with a 41% job approval rating for Joe Biden, who averaged 39.8% in 2023.

Still, views of the economy remain largely negative, particularly among Republicans and independents, which could spell trouble for Biden as he seeks reelection.

Despite a robust job market and an inflation rate that has dropped from over 9 percent in June 2022 to 3.7 percent last month, Americans take a dim view of the economy, with large percentages using words like “horrible,” “awful,” “bad,” and “shambles” to describe it, compared to smaller percentages that use words such as “excellent,” “good,” “growing,” or “improving.”

A stunning 84 percent of respondents say the cost of living is rising, citing the swelling price of everyday needs. Food prices are rising the most, according to nearly half (49%) of respondents, followed by housing costs (16%), utility bills (11%), and transportation, including gas (11%).

The Suffolk University Sawyer Business School/USA TODAY survey sought out opinions of 1,000 adults nationwide—evenly split by gender, geography, and across the political spectrum.

Kitchen table financial issues were paramount in respondents’ minds. Americans overwhelmingly said they are cutting back on spending. More than 71% said they are going out to eat less often. They are dialing back spending on clothing purchases (68%), groceries (53%), vacations (58%), and canceling or delaying home improvements (57%).

Spending less, saving less

Nearly 60% of those polled said they disapproved of President Joe Biden’s handling of the economy, and when asked whether they had more trust in Biden or Donald Trump to improve it, the respondents favored Trump by a 47%-36% margin.

“This poll shows a real disconnect between the way the Biden administration has described the economy and how a majority of Americans say they feel about the economy and the need to curtail their spending in almost all categories,” said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center in Boston. “We have many Americans, especially lower income families, who are not anticipating a happy holiday season this year.”

Nearly 44% of all those polled said they will cut back on holiday spending this year. Nearly 40% said their family’s total debt had increased, and 30% said they were forced to cut into their savings to pay bills.

US households earning under $50,000 reported feeling most pummeled by the economy. Those respondents described an unsustainable path of declining savings, increased debt, dramatic reductions in daily spending, and general pessimism about the future.

A clear majority of those lower income households said they are cutting back on everything: food, clothing, utilities, travel, healthcare, even dialing back the home thermostat to save money. Households earning $100,000 or more reported cutting back significantly in only two categories: restaurants and retail.

Policy Choices for a Weak Global Economy

As prepared for delivery

Thank you, Fred for your kind introduction, and my thanks to you and the staff of the Atlantic Council for hosting this event. Like the IMF, the Council is an institution grounded in the belief that dialogue and cooperation can build a more prosperous world.

We also share some DNA. Secretary Dean Acheson, who co-founded the Atlantic Council, was also present at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 which gave birth to the IMF and World Bank.

Reflecting on his years in public service, Acheson later wrote that: “The simple truth is that perseverance in good policies is the only avenue to success...""[1].

In a world of more frequent shocks and heightened uncertainty we need good policies more than ever.

Making the right policy choices will define the future of the world economy. It will define how this decade is remembered — will it go down in history as ‘the Turbulent Twenties’, a time of disturbance and divergence in economic fortunes; the ‘Tepid Twenties”, a time of slow growth and popular discontent; or ‘the Transformational Twenties’, a time of rapid technological advancements for the good of humanity?

Let me start with where we are today.

You will see in our World Economic Outlook next week that global growth is marginally stronger on account of robust activity in the United States and in many emerging market economies. Sustained household consumption and business investment and an easing of supply chain problems helped. And inflation is going down.

The resilience of the world economy, mostly due to sound macroeconomic fundamentals built over the last years, is helped by strong labor markets and an expanding labor force. The strength of labor supply is partly due to immigration, which has been especially helpful in countries with aging populations.

Overall, based on the data it is tempting to breathe a sigh of relief. We have avoided a global recession and a period of stagflation—as some had predicted.

But there are still plenty of things to worry about.

The global environment has become more challenging. Geopolitical tensions increase the risks of fragmentation of the world economy. And, as we learned over the past few years, we operate in a world in which we must expect the unexpected.

The sobering reality is global economic activity is weak by historical standards. Prospects for growth have been slowing since the global financial crisis. Inflation is not fully defeated. Fiscal buffers have been depleted. And debt is up, posing a major challenge to public finances in many countries.

The scars of the pandemic are still with us. The global output loss since 2020 is around $3.3 trillion, with the costs disproportionately falling on the most vulnerable countries.

And we see a growing divergence within and across country groups.

Among advanced economies, the US has experienced the strongest rebound, helped by rising productivity growth. By contrast, activity in the euro area is recovering much more gradually, reflecting the lingering effects of high energy prices and weaker productivity growth.

Among emerging market economies, countries like Indonesia and India are faring better.

But the most striking divergence is for low-income countries for whom scarring has been the most severe. Among these nations, fragile and conflicted-affected economies are bearing the heaviest burden.

Beneath it all, the primary driver of weaker growth is a significant and broad-based slowdown in productivity. Our analysis shows it accounts for over half of the growth slowdown in advanced and emerging economies, and nearly all in low-income countries.

As a result, our medium-term outlook for global growth remains well below its historical average—just above 3 percent.

Without a course correction, we are indeed heading for ‘the Tepid Twenties’ – a sluggish and disappointing decade.

At this juncture, policymakers face a choice.

They can avoid difficult decisions and try to muddle through with less-than-good polices.

Or they can make another choice. They can follow Acheson’s advice and choose good policies: deal decisively with inflation and debt; and promote economic transformation to boost productivity, inclusion, and sustainable growth.

What we need is the ‘Transformational Twenties'.

But first thing first: we need to bring back price stability.

This is the task of central bankers, many of whom are carefully calibrating this important policy choice—when to cut interest rates and by how much.

We have seen what good policy can achieve since inflation peaked in mid-2022. In the final quarter of 2023, headline inflation for advanced economies was 2.3 percent, down from 9.5 percent just 18 months earlier. For the median emerging market and developing economy, inflation declined to 4.1 percent.

We expect the trend to continue in 2024, creating the conditions for major advanced economy central banks to begin cutting rates in the second half of the year.

But the pace and timing of the monetary pivot will vary. Some central banks have already begun to loosen, mostly in emerging markets where inflation was tackled early. But elsewhere—primarily in advanced economies—they are still holding off for now. They must carefully calibrate their decisions to incoming data.

On this final stretch, it is doubly important that central banks uphold their independence. As we know, policy credibility is vital in the fight to restore price stability.

Where necessary, policymakers must resist calls for early interest rate cuts. Premature easing could see new inflation surprises that may even necessitate a further bout of monetary tightening. On the other side, delaying too long could pour cold water on economic activity.

Second, time has come to rebuild fiscal buffers.

Over the past couple of years, we have advocated for fiscal policy restraint to support central banks as they fight inflation. A focus on fiscal policy is now warranted in its own right. Fiscal buffers are exhausted and debt levels in most countries are simply too high.

The trend of rising debts began more than a decade ago—during a prolonged period of very low interest rates. The pandemic necessitated an unprecedented fiscal response to protect lives and livelihoods. Debt surged even more.

Now, we are in an era of far higher interest rates. This is pushing up the cost of servicing debt.

In advanced economies, excluding the US, interest payments on public debt will average about 5 percent of government revenues this year.

But the cost of servicing debt is most painful in low-income countries. Their interest payments are set to average about 14 percent of government revenue—roughly double the level from 15 years ago.

For most countries, prospects of a soft landing and strong labor markets mean there is no better time to act: to reach sustainable debt levels and build stronger buffers to cope with future shocks.

For some, delay is simply not an option: consolidation must start now to avoid tipping into debt distress.

And for the handful of countries already in debt distress, restructuring may be necessary. The G20 Common Framework can help. Zambia recently finalized its agreement with bondholders, complementing the restructuring with official bilateral creditors—bravo!

We must build on lessons learned to improve the debt restructuring process. During the Spring Meetings, we will again convene our Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable. Our goal is to bring further clarity on “comparability of treatment” among different creditor groups and to establish clear and predictable timelines for debt restructuring.

For all countries, rich and poor, fiscal prudence is hard. This is especially true in a year with a record number of elections and at a time of high anxiety due to exceptional uncertainty and years of shocks.

In fact, our forecasts show deficits will still be too high to stabilize debt in over one third of advanced and emerging economies, and in more than one quarter of low-income countries.

This is why we advocate for adopting credible medium-term fiscal frameworks as the ultimate ‘good policy’ choice for countries.

We also recommend more focus on closing tax loopholes, strengthening tax collection, and improving the quality of public spending. Fiscal strength allows countries to support the most vulnerable parts of society and to invest in a better future.

This brings me to the third priority: policies to reinvigorate growth.

Lifting up growth prospects is paramount to improve living standards and strengthen economic resilience. It requires eliminating constraints to economic activity and creating opportunities to boost productivity growth.

Foundational reforms — strengthening governance, cutting red tape, increasing female labor market participation, improving access to capital — all have a role to play. Across emerging and developing countries, a well-sequenced package of reforms could lift output by 8 percent in four years.

Even more can be achieved with policies to encourage economic transformation — to speed up the green and digital transition. How well we handle them will define the legacy of this decade.

This is particularly important for the green transition. How quickly we advance it will have tremendous significance for whether we succeed to tame climate risks. But the shift to a climate friendly economy goes beyond managing risks. It also offers tremendous opportunities for investment, jobs, and growth.

We are already witnessing the economic, health and environmental benefits of transformative investments—including in renewable energy, electric mobility, and ecosystems restoration. For every $1 spent on fossil fuels, $1.7 is now spent on clean energy. Five years ago, this ratio was 1:1. But robust policies and institutions are needed for a stable and encouraging investment climate and to tackle a broad range of market failures.

Technological advancements affect many sectors of the economy—from manufacturing to healthcare and financial services. We have been transitioning to a new digital economy, and now AI is likely to dramatically accelerate the fourth Industrial Revolution.

This brings huge potential benefits but also risks. A recent IMF study shows that AI could affect up to 40 percent of jobs across the world and 60 percent in advanced economies. It could enhance workers’ productivity but also threaten some jobs. Investing in digital infrastructure and skills, as well as in strong social safety nets, will determine the pace of AI adoption and its impact on productivity.

Both the climate and the digital transformation require coordinated global efforts to manage risks and capture the benefits they create.

And this is my final point—cooperation on policies matters for the world.

The pandemic, wars, and geopolitical tensions have changed the playbook for global economic relations. Policymakers are looking to strike a balance between efficiency and security, between cost considerations and resilience in supply chains. There are already signs that trade relations are being re-shaped.

Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, trade growth between economies in politically distant blocs has slowed by 2.4 percentage points more than trade among those that are more closely aligned.

As trade flows are re-routed, ‘connector’ countries may benefit. But supply chains are lengthening, with potential costs at each step.

And industrial policies are back on the agenda—with new analysis showing more than 2,500 policy interventions worldwide last year. China, the EU, and US account for almost half of the total.

How should we think about these measures?

In short, if there is a market failure that is being addressed—such as accelerating innovation to address the existential threat of climate change—there is a case for government intervention, including through industrial policy.

If there is no market failure, there is a need for caution. The case for government intervention is much weaker. Some of the measures announced or implemented last year were not always clearly related to market failures.

IMF staff has stepped up work in this area because more data, analysis and dialogue are needed to avoid costly mistakes.

More broadly, we advocate for more trade and cross-border investment flows to increase productivity and address global challenges. And for more attention to how the benefits from trade and investment are shared in society. We must avoid past mistakes when the negative impact of globalization on some communities was ignored and led to backlash against an integrated world economy.

Throughout our history, the IMF has been and remains a transmission line for good policies and a place for economic cooperation.

In a fast-changing and more turbulent world, bringing countries together to tackle challenges and pursue opportunities is more important than ever.

When the world was hit by the pandemic and the cost-of-living crisis, the IMF acted decisively to provide financial and policy support to our members.

We have also stepped up our efforts to help countries deal with transformational challenges such as climate change and the digital transition—with new analysis, new partnerships, and new instruments. For example, we now have 18 countries using our new Resilience and Sustainability Trust.

And just as countries need to build resilience to deal with future shocks, so too must the IMF.

We are already doing it.

Our members have supported a fifty percent increase in our permanent lending resources. And more capacity to provide financial support to our poorest members.

We have just reached the target for building up our own financial buffers, so we can be a reliable anchor for countries experiencing balance of payment shocks. We are now directing our attention to how to make better use of our balance sheet to ensure we are well-positioned to continue to help our members.

This is a fitting note on which to conclude. Just as our balance sheet represents the collective financial strength of our members, our Spring Meetings next week represent our collective commitment to cooperation and international dialogue.

So, as we gather in Washington, we have what Acheson described as a fundamental choice: “between meeting the problems with which the world will be faced… through methods of international cooperation…, or …each nation’s relying on its own resources and its own strength and going its own way in the world.”[2]

Working together is the choice of good policies.

The choice that will deliver the growth, jobs, and prosperity people aspire to — everywhere.

Thank you.

89,US economy shrank 3.5% in 2020 after growing 4% last quarter - The Associated Press,US economy shrank 3.5% in 2020 after growing 4% last quarter  The Associated Press,"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3VzLWVjb25vbXktc2hyaW5rLWluLTIwMjAtYjU5ZjliZTA2ZGNmMWRhOTI0ZjY0YWZkZTJjZTA5NGPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Associated Press,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Stuck in the grip of a viral pandemic, the U.S. economy grew at a 4% annual rate in the final three months of 2020 and shrank last year by the largest amount in 74 years.

For 2020 as a whole, a year when the coronavirus inflicted the worst economic freeze since the end of World War II, the economy contracted 3.5% and clouded the outlook for the coming year. The economic damage followed the eruption of the pandemic 10 months ago and the deep recession it triggered, with tens of millions of Americans left jobless.

Thursday’s report from the government estimated that the nation’s gross domestic product — its total output of goods and services — slowed sharply in the October-December quarter from a record 33.4% surge in the July-September quarter. That gain had followed a record-shattering 31.4% annual plunge in the April-June quarter, when the economy sank into a free-fall.

The outlook for 2021 remains hazy. Economists warn that a sustained recovery won’t likely take hold until vaccines are distributed and administered nationwide and government-enacted rescue aid spreads through the economy — a process likely to take months. In the meantime, millions of Americans continue to struggle.

On Thursday, for example, the government reported that while applications for unemployment benefits declined last week, they remained at a historically high 847,000, evidence that companies keep cutting jobs as the pandemic continues to rage. Before the virus erupted in the United States in March, weekly applications for jobless aid had never topped 700,000, even during the Great Recession.

Even as the economy shrank last year, the stock market managed to rise sharply, with the S&P 500 index gaining 16%. The disparity between the two reflected a time-tested adage: The stock market is a forward-looking indicator, with investors focused on prospects for future corporate profits and economic health rather than on the current state of the economy. So even as the economy was sinking last year, investors looked ahead to hopes for vaccines and government aid and to solid company profits, especially among tech companies, which drove last year’s gains.

The pandemic’s blow to the economy early last spring ended the longest U.S. economic expansion on record — nearly 11 years. The damage from the virus caused GDP to contract at a 5% annual rate in last year’s January-March quarter. Since then, thousands of businesses have closed, nearly 10 million people remain out of work and more than 400,000 Americans have died from the virus.

The government’s report Thursday was its first of three estimates of growth last quarter; the figure will be revised twice in the coming weeks. The report showed that consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of the economy, slowed sharply last quarter to a 2.5% annual gain from a 41% surge in the July-September quarter.

Last quarter’s economy was instead driven in part by business investment and housing, which has been a star performer during the past year, reflecting record-low mortgage rates and a demand for more household space. Housing grew at a sizzling 33.5% annual rate, business investment at a 13.8% rate. Government spending, though, shrank at a 1.2% rate last quarter. State and local governments have started to resort to layoffs in response to falling tax revenue.

The estimated drop in GDP for 2020 was the first such decline since a 2.5% fall in 2009, during the recession that followed the 2008 financial crisis. That was the deepest annual setback since the economy shrank 11.6% in 1946, when the economy was demobilizing after World War II.

The GDP report showed that former President Donald Trump ended his presidency with GDP averaging annual gains of 1% during his four years. That was lower than the 1.6% annual GDP gains during the Obama administration, a period that also included a recession.

In the coming months, as vaccines become widely distributed and administered, growth is expected to revive. But until then, many Americans will struggle as consumers and businesses hunker down and hold back on spending even though the economy will likely keep growing. Gregory Daco, chief economist at Oxford Economics, said he expects growth to weaken in the current quarter to a roughly 2% annual rate.

But Daco foresees a brightening outlook for the rest of this year. His view assumes a widespread use of vaccines, increased government aid from Congress’ approval of at least part of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion relief package and pent-up spending from a savings buildup among higher-income families during the pandemic. A $900 billion rescue aid package that the government enacted late last year is also providing some support.

“The vaccine rollout is essential,” Daco said. “Without an improving health situation, we are not going to get any improvement in the economic situation.”

Daco said he thinks an economic rebound will produce annual growth this year of 5%. Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund forecast that the U.S. economy will grow 5.1% this year and 2.5% in 2022.

On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve took note of the economic threats. It kept its benchmark interest rate at a record low near zero and stressed that it would keep pursuing its low-rate policies until a recovery is well underway. The Fed acknowledged that the economy has faltered in recent months, with hiring weakening especially in industries affected by the raging pandemic, notably restaurants, bars, hotels and others involved in face-to-face public contact.

Hiring in the United States has slowed for six straight months, and employers shed jobs in December for the first time since April. The job market has sputtered as the pandemic and colder weather have discouraged Americans from traveling, shopping, dining out or visiting entertainment venues. Retail sales have declined for three straight months.

Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, predicts that about 5 million lost U.S. jobs will never return, forcing the unemployed in such industries as restaurants and bars to find work in other sectors.

And many economists warn that without further government financial support, the economy risks succumbing to another recession. They note that much of the aid for individuals from the $900 billion package that was enacted late last year is set to expire in mid-March.","(0, 'GDP')"
90,The Economic Benefits of Extending Permanent Legal Status to Unauthorized Immigrants | CEA - The White House,The Economic Benefits of Extending Permanent Legal Status to Unauthorized Immigrants | CEA  The White House,"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53aGl0ZWhvdXNlLmdvdi9jZWEvd3JpdHRlbi1tYXRlcmlhbHMvMjAyMS8wOS8xNy90aGUtZWNvbm9taWMtYmVuZWZpdHMtb2YtZXh0ZW5kaW5nLXBlcm1hbmVudC1sZWdhbC1zdGF0dXMtdG8tdW5hdXRob3JpemVkLWltbWlncmFudHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The White House,"By Chair Cecilia Rouse, Lisa Barrow, Kevin Rinz, and Evan Soltas

The United States is often described as a nation of immigrants. With the exception of Native Americans, the vast majority of Americans are immigrants or the descendants of immigrants or enslaved people. This diversity has been celebrated for its contributions to American culture through cuisine, language, and the arts, among many other influences.

Immigrants also make an important contribution to the U.S. economy. Most directly, immigration increases potential economic output by increasing the size of the labor force. Immigrants also contribute to increasing productivity. Economists Gaetano Basso and Giovanni Peri find that immigrants are more mobile than natives in response to local economic conditions, perhaps because they have fewer long-standing familial and community ties, helping labor markets to function more efficiently. Economists Jennifer Hunt and Marjolaine Gauthier-Loiselle have also shown that immigrants boost innovation, a key factor in generating improvements in living standards. Specifically, they find that a 1 percentage point increase in the population share of immigrant college graduates increases patents per capita by 9 percent to 18 percent.

While most immigrants residing in the United States are legally authorized to live and work here, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) estimates the population of unauthorized immigrants to be roughly 11.4 million as of 2018. This estimate and those used by researchers include beneficiaries of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Temporary Protected Status (TPS), even though both groups have legal authorization to live and work in the United States on a temporary basis.[1] This diverse population also includes other individuals who either entered without passing through immigration (unauthorized entry), or legally came to the United States on a temporary basis and then overstayed their visa.[2] Most of these individuals may not legally work or receive safety-net benefits—or only can under substantial restrictions.

This blog discusses the economics of legalizing unauthorized immigrants. Some critics claim that legalizing unauthorized immigrants, as proposed by the Build Back Better framework, could be costly because they would become eligible for additional social insurance benefits such as Medicaid. However, granting permanent legal status would also likely raise tax revenues, increase productivity, and have additional benefits for the children of these immigrants, generating substantial economic value for the country.

Permanent legal status is likely to increase the effective labor supply of unauthorized immigrants.

About 73 percent of unauthorized-immigrant adults ages 18 to 65 were employed in any given year from 2014 to 2019, roughly equal to the employment rates of non-citizen legal residents and U.S. citizens.[3] Permanent legal status would likely allow these workers to be more productive, generating gains that could be realized through a variety of channels.

Critically, permanent legal status would allow these currently unauthorized immigrants to pursue and accept jobs for which their skills are well-suited, rather than being restricted to particular sectors of the economy, such as agriculture, construction, and leisure and hospitality, where employers often do not insist on legal status and where wages are lower on average. For example, around one-half of workers in the U.S. dairy industry—which in 2018 paid between $11 and $13 an hour for general labor—are immigrants, most of whom are thought to be unauthorized.[4] Without legal status, unauthorized immigrants have limited opportunities for job mobility, a key channel by which other workers find better, more productive employment matches over their careers.

Comparisons between the earnings of authorized and unauthorized immigrants suggest that limited job opportunities cause talent to be misallocated, reducing productivity. Unauthorized-immigrant workers have been estimated to earn about 40 percent less per hour than native-born workers and about 35 percent less per hour than legal immigrants. A large part of these gaps can be explained by differences in average skills as measured by educational attainment; however, after adjusting for these and other demographic differences, this research continues to find a significant “wage penalty” for unauthorized workers ranging from 4 percent to 24 percent of their hourly wage. Further, we estimate that there is no wage penalty for unauthorized-immigrant workers relative to similar legal immigrants within the same occupation and industry, which suggests the penalty arises from being confined to low-paying jobs.[5]

In addition to employment opportunities, evidence from prior legalizations in the United States and in other countries suggests that legalization also encourages immigrants to improve their language skills, induces them to complete additional education and training, and improves their health outcomes, all of which make them more productive members of society. For example, evidence from Germany finds that faster access to citizenship led immigrant women to improve their language skills in addition to increasing their labor force attachment. In a study of U.S. teenagers born to the same immigrant families—but whose legal status varies due to the countries in which they were born—the unauthorized-immigrant teenagers were about 2.6 percentage points less likely to be enrolled in school. In addition, evidence from the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) and DACA shows these reforms increased schooling for previously-unauthorized immigrants. Finally, a recent economic study also suggests that DACA-recipients experienced improved physical and mental health, which contributes to increased productivity.

In a market economy, employees’ productivity influences their pay. As a result, productivity improvements—through better job matches, investments in skills, and increases in physical and mental health—should be reflected in increased wages among the legalized immigrants. Indeed, the research evidence supports this hypothesis. For example, research finds that the wages of DACA-eligible Dreamers rose 4 to 5 percent by 2016 relative to those not eligible.[6] Another study concludes that the DACA-related gains in earnings for unauthorized workers were largest among the lowest paid workers. These results signify that even though these unauthorized immigrants may currently be working in the United States, providing them with legal permanent status would increase their effective labor supply, that is, the work their greater productivity enables them to do. Importantly, this increase in productivity is foundational for improving U.S. economic growth.

Given that providing legal status to unauthorized immigrants would increase their effective labor supply, critics of legalization argue there could be adverse labor market consequences for native and other immigrant workers. While there is not a large economics literature on the labor market effects of legalization on other workers, in a well-cited National Academies report on the economic and fiscal impact of immigration, a distinguished group of experts concludes that in the longer run, the effect of immigration on wages overall is very small.[7]

Permanent legal status would likely have implications for costs and revenues for the Federal government.

While granting permanent legal status to unauthorized immigrants would likely boost economic growth, some are concerned about the price tag, given that an increased number of legal immigrants could enroll in, and raise costs of, social benefit programs. However, some of this increased cost would likely be offset by higher tax contributions.[8]

Consider first the potential increase in costs to the Federal government associated with receipt of social benefits. Legal status may make undocumented immigrants more comfortable using Federal benefits for which they are already eligible, such as emergency health services under Medicaid and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). In addition, newly-legalized immigrants could take up social benefits for which they were previously ineligible due to their unauthorized status. Based on benefit use among demographically-similar, non-citizen legal immigrants, this increase in take-up could be significant. For example, many of these immigrants could become fully eligible for Medicaid.[9] Finally, granting legal status could also increase benefit take-up among citizen or authorized-immigrant relatives of undocumented immigrants; several studies find that the threat of an undocumented relative being deported discouraged benefit take-up by citizen members of the same household, even though those citizens are eligible for benefits and cannot be deported.

However, much of the direct fiscal cost of these public benefits is likely to be repaid due to increased tax contributions from the immigrants, and, in the long run, by positive fiscal contributions from their children. Anyone working in the United States is supposed to be paying taxes; however, Federal income tax compliance rates for unauthorized immigrants are unknown. Several government agencies and nongovernmental organizations estimate rates between 50 and 75 percent. By comparison, tax compliance rates on ordinary wage income are close to 100 percent for the U.S. population as a whole, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.

Shifts from the informal to the formal sector that are expected to result from legal status would likely increase tax compliance rates. Indeed, after the passage of IRCA, researchers found that income tax compliance rates of previously-unauthorized immigrants in California became comparable to other residents. Combined with the wage gains, gross tax revenues would increase. Moreover, undocumented immigrants are disproportionately of prime-working age (see Figure 1) and relatively younger than prime-age U.S. citizens. Therefore, they are likely to have many working years during which they will be paying these higher payroll and income taxes if they are legalized.

Finally, many children of unauthorized immigrants grow up in households below the Federal poverty level because their parents cannot secure higher-paying work due to their immigration status. Growing up poor can be harmful for child development, and providing public health insurance and nutrition assistance has been shown to improve the health of immigrant children. In general, the direct fiscal cost of public assistance for low-income children is thought to be substantially or fully offset in the long run. The costs are offset by increases in tax revenues and reductions in spending on government programs when these children grow up to become higher-earning adults than they would have had they not received assistance.[10]

Conclusion

Immigrants have made innumerable contributions to American business and society. However, current law confines millions of them to a life in the shadows, without the rights to be fully economically engaged or have access to foundational social protections. Such treatment inflicts harms on unauthorized immigrants themselves and their families—many of which include U.S. citizens and non-citizen legal residents—as well as to the broader economy.

Though some argue that increased take-up of social programs would generate a substantial fiscal cost to the government, the productivity of the newly-legalized would likely increase, which would benefit all in the United States by expanding economic output. Further, the ensuing increase in wages and compliance with tax requirements would increase their contributions to public sector finances, and their children would benefit as well. Allowing currently unauthorized workers to engage fully in the labor force would not only benefit the immigrants and their families, but society as a whole.

Dreamers (individuals born between 1981 and 2012 brought to the United States as children) who applied to and were accepted into the DACA program can legally work and reside in the United States, but only for two years, at which point they must apply to renew their status; the Supreme Court ruled in June 2020 that the Trump Administration could not end the program, but the U.S. District Court in Southern Texas ruled in July 2021 that the program is not lawful. While those currently in the DACA program are still protected and can reapply, new applicants are not accepted, and the case is making its way through the Federal courts. TPS is granted only until resolution of the conditions in a recipient’s country of origin that make it difficult or unsafe to return.

[6] Evidence from the wage impacts of naturalization in the United States and other countries; smaller extensions of work authorization to particular groups of unauthorized immigrants, such as those aided by the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992; and reforms that have restricted employment options for unauthorized workers, also suggest that granting legal status would improve labor market outcomes of unauthorized workers.

[7] See also David Card’s Richard T. Ely Lecture to the American Economic Association in which he argues that immigrants have had at most small impacts on wage inequality among natives.

[8] We note that the fiscal impacts of providing legal permanent status to existing unauthorized immigrants likely differ from prior analyses of the fiscal impacts of immigration generally, as unauthorized immigrants are already in the country, and many currently work, pay taxes, and receive some forms of government benefits. This existing relationship with the government makes it necessary to estimate how their rates of tax compliance and take-up of benefits would change if they gained legal status. Such calculations are not straightforward and require important assumptions, some with scarce relevant data and evidence that could inform them.

[9] Unauthorized immigrants who entered the United States after August 22, 1996—the date Federal welfare reforms were signed into law—would generally be eligible only after a waiting period of five years of legal residence for several benefits, including non-emergency health services under Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

[10] At present the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) does not account for any long-run fiscal return to public benefit programs, suggesting that current approaches to “scoring” the fiscal impacts of legal status are likely to overstate their true fiscal cost.","(1, 'employment/wages')"
91,"US economy grew at a surprisingly strong 3.3% pace last quarter, pointing to continued resilience - The Associated Press","US economy grew at a surprisingly strong 3.3% pace last quarter, pointing to continued resilience  The Associated Press","Thu, 25 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2Vjb25vbXktZ3Jvd3RoLWluZmxhdGlvbi1nZHAtY29uc3VtZXJzLXNwZW5kaW5nLXJhdGVzLWUyMWJiMjNjZWJlNmQyYWUxMGIwZjBlOTg3NjY5MWZk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Associated Press,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The nation’s economy grew at an unexpectedly brisk 3.3% annual pace from October through December as Americans showed a continued willingness to spend freely despite high interest rates and price levels that have frustrated many households.

Thursday’s report from the Commerce Department said the gross domestic product — the economy’s total output of goods and services — decelerated from its sizzling 4.9% growth rate the previous quarter. But the latest figures still reflected the surprising durability of the world’s largest economy, which U.S. voters are assessing ahead of the November elections.

The latest data marked the sixth straight quarter in which GDP has grown at an annual pace of 2% or more. Consumers, who account for about 70% of the total economy, drove the growth. Their spending expanded at a 2.8% annual rate, for items ranging from clothing, furniture, recreational vehicles and other goods to services like hotels and restaurant meals.

The GDP report also showed that despite the robust pace of growth in the October-December quarter, inflationary measures continued to ease. Consumer prices rose at a 1.7% annual rate, down from 2.6% in the third quarter. And excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core inflation came in at a 2% annual rate.

Those inflation numbers could reassure the Federal Reserve’s policymakers, who have already signaled that they expect to cut their benchmark interest rate three times in 2024, reversing their 2022-2023 policy of aggressively raising rates to fight inflation. Some economists think the Fed could begin cutting rates as early as May.

Nathan Sheets, global chief economist at Citi, said that recent experience suggests that economic growth can remain solid even as inflation cools.

“It underscores for the Fed that they don’t have to be in a hurry” to ease borrowing rates to aid the economy, said Sheets, who thinks the first rate cut will occur in June.

After an extended period of gloom, Americans are starting to feel somewhat better about inflation and the economy — a trend that could sustain consumer spending, fuel economic growth and potentially affect voters’ decisions this fall. A measure of consumer sentiment by the University of Michigan, for example, has jumped in the past two months by the most since 1991.

There is growing optimism that the Fed is on track to deliver a rare “soft landing” — keeping borrowing rates high enough to cool growth, hiring and inflation yet not so much as to send the economy into a tailspin. Inflation touched a four-decade high in 2022 but has since edged steadily lower without the painful layoffs that most economists had thought would be necessary to slow the acceleration of prices.

The economy has repeatedly defied predictions that the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes would trigger a recession. Far from collapsing last year, the economy accelerated — expanding 2.5%, up from 1.9% in 2022.

“Our expectation is for a soft landing, and it looks like things are moving that way,’’ said Beth Ann Bovino, chief economist at U.S. Bank. Still, Bovino expects the economy to slow somewhat this year as higher rates weaken borrowing and spending.

“People are going to get squeezed,’’ she said.

At an appearance Thursday, President Joe Biden pointed to the strength of the GDP report to tout his stewardship of the economy.

“The experts from the time I got elected were insisting that a recession was just around the corner,’’ he said during a visit to the swing state of Wisconsin. “ ‘Every month there’s gonna be a recession.’ Well, you know, we’ve got really strong growth.”

The economy’s outlook had looked far bleaker a year ago. As recently as April 2023, an economic model published by the Conference Board, a business group, had pegged the likelihood of a U.S. recession over the next 12 months at close to 99%.

Even as inflation in the United States has slowed significantly, overall prices remain nearly 17% above where they were before the pandemic erupted three years ago, which has exasperated many Americans. That fact will likely raise a pivotal question for the nation’s voters, many of whom are still feeling the lingering financial and psychological effects of the worst bout of inflation in four decades. Which will carry more weight in the presidential election: The sharp drop in inflation or the fact that most prices are well above where they were three years ago?

The Fed began raising its benchmark rate in March 2022 in response to the resurgence in inflation that accompanied the economy’s recovery from the pandemic recession. By the time its hikes ended in July last year, the central bank had raised its influential rate from near zero to roughly 5.4%, the highest level since 2001.

As the Fed’s rate hikes worked their way through the economy, year-over-year inflation slowed from 9.1% in June 2022, the fastest rate in four decades, to 3.4% as of last month. That marked a striking improvement but still leaves that inflation measure above the Fed’s 2% target.

The progress so far has come at surprisingly little economic cost. Employers have added a healthy 225,000 jobs a month over the past year. And unemployment has remained below 4% for 23 straight months, the longest such streak since the 1960s.

The once red-hot job market has cooled somewhat, easing pressure on companies to raise pay to keep or attract employees and then pass on their higher labor costs to their customers through price hikes.

It’s happened in perhaps the least painful way: Employers are generally posting fewer job openings rather than laying off workers. That is partly because many companies are reluctant to risk losing workers after having been caught flat-footed when the economy roared back from the brief but brutal 2020 pandemic recession.

“Businesses are getting rid of job openings, but they’re holding onto workers,” Bovino said.

Another reason for the economy’s sturdiness is that consumers emerged from the pandemic in surprisingly good financial shape, partly because tens of millions of households had received government stimulus checks. As a result, many consumers have managed to keep spending even in the face of rising prices and high interest rates.

Some economists have suggested that the economy will weaken in the coming months as pandemic savings are exhausted, credit card use nears its limits and higher borrowing rates curtail spending. Still, the government reported last week that consumers stepped up their spending at retailers in December, an upbeat end to the holiday shopping season.

Credit card balances and rates were at record highs even before the recent solid holiday shopping season. And buy-now-pay-later plans, which let shoppers break up the cost of an item over time, have spiked.

IPEF is part of the Biden Administration's commitment to strengthening ties with allies and partners and tackling 21st-century economic challenges in the Indo-Pacific region.

The Framework seeks to advance resilience, sustainability, inclusiveness, economic growth, fairness, and competitiveness for the 14 IPEF economies. The Framework also will provide tangible benefits that fuel economic activity and investment, promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth, and benefit workers and consumers across the region.

Since its launch, the IPEF Partners have engaged in intensive discussions to scope out each of the four pillars of the Framework, covering Trade; Supply Chains; Clean Economy; and Fair Economy respectively.

At the conclusion of the Senior Officials and Ministerial meetings in September 2022, the Partners reached consensus on Ministerial Statements summarizing objectives for each pillar. Text-based negotiations for each of the four IPEF pillars commenced with the first negotiating round in Brisbane in December and have continued since. The IPEF Partners agreed to an aggressive negotiating schedule for 2023 in order to make substantial progress and have since substantially concluded negotiations for Pillar II in May 2023 and substantially concluded negotiations for Pillars III and IV in November 2023.

The Partners

The United States is proud to work with 13 diverse partner countries representing 40 percent of global GDP and 28 percent of global goods and services trade.

The Partners include:

Australia;

Brunei Darussalam;

Fiji;

India;

Indonesia;

Japan;

the Republic of Korea;

Malaysia;

New Zealand;

Philippines;

Singapore;

Thailand; and

Vietnam.

The United States has deep and expanding economic ties with these Partners: U.S. foreign direct investment in the region totaled more than $969 billion in 2020 and has nearly doubled in the last decade. Trade with the Indo-Pacific supports more than three million American jobs and is the source of nearly $900 billion in foreign direct investment into the United States. Deepening our economic engagement in the region will boost prosperity at home and abroad, creating more jobs and raising standards across the region.

Global prospects remain highly uncertain one year into the pandemic. New virus mutations and the accumulating human toll raise concerns, even as growing vaccine coverage lifts sentiment. Economic recoveries are diverging across countries and sectors, reflecting variation in pandemic-induced disruptions and the extent of policy support. The outlook depends not just on the outcome of the battle between the virus and vaccines—it also hinges on how effectively economic policies deployed under high uncertainty can limit lasting damage from this unprecedented crisis.

Global growth is projected at 6 percent in 2021, moderating to 4.4 percent in 2022. The projections for 2021 and 2022 are stronger than in the October 2020 WEO. The upward revision reflects additional fiscal support in a few large economies, the anticipated vaccine-powered recovery in the second half of 2021, and continued adaptation of economic activity to subdued mobility. High uncertainty surrounds this outlook, related to the path of the pandemic, the effectiveness of policy support to provide a bridge to vaccine-powered normalization, and the evolution of financial conditions.","(0, 'GDP')"

For Wang Ran, a 27-year-old designer, lunch at the restaurant in Beijing costs about half what she would normally pay — which makes a big difference as she downgrades her spending amid an economic slump in China that could have global ramifications.

Previously, Wang said, “I pretty much bought things whenever I saw something I liked. But this year, I might have to consider the financial aspect a bit more.”

Decades of breakneck growth transformed China into the world’s second-largest economy and lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, swelling the middle class from 3% of the population in 2000 to more than 50% in 2018, according to the Pew Research Center, which defines middle class in China as living on $2 to $50 a day.

For decades, this modern economic miracle buoyed the ruling Chinese Communist Party, which promised the Chinese public security and prosperity in exchange for severe constraints on political freedom. But a new period of relatively slower growth has created uncertainty for the more than 700 million people in China’s middle class, the largest in the world.

The Chinese economy is still growing, to the tune of 5.2% last year, according to official data. That compares with average annual growth of about 7% last decade and more than 10% in the 2000s. Some economists say this year’s growth target of about 5% is overly ambitious.

The slowdown means middle-class Chinese can no longer assume continuous economic gains or that their children’s quality of life will be better than theirs.

Economic concerns have driven Chinese President Xi Jinping to improve relations with foreign companies and governments, including the U.S. At a meeting with a group of American CEOs in Beijing last month, he said the Chinese economy was “healthy and sustainable,” an achievement that “cannot be separated from international cooperation.”

But he has also made it clear that his top priority is national security, not the economy, pushing measures such as an expanded anti-espionage law that have alarmed foreign companies. His government has also been reluctant to provide consumer handouts that might boost spending, for fear of promoting “welfarism.”

Even as China reports stronger economic numbers, the public mood remains anxious, said Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington.

“China is suffering from its own version of long Covid,” he said in an interview in Beijing last month.

The country’s emergence from three years of pandemic isolation has been “quite bumpy,” to say the least, Kennedy said.

“You’ve got the housing market, which has run into mega headwinds, and you’ve got developers collapsing, prices falling in different cities,” he said. “That’s the primary asset that Chinese households have.”

On top of the property crisis, China is also grappling with local government debt, a stock market rout and a decline in exports and foreign direct investment amid geopolitical tensions.

Chinese officials recognize the need to shift the country’s development model away from the property sector and toward consumption, and they have vowed measures to boost household spending. But the public doesn’t appear to be on board: Data shows the savings rate hit an all-time high in February, while consumer confidence is near a record low.

The reluctance of Chinese consumers could be a problem for the U.S. and other countries, which have voiced mounting worries that Chinese exports could flood their markets in a bid to find willing spenders.

In a visit to China that ended Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen focused on what she calls manufacturing overcapacity, particularly in electric vehicles and solar panels, both sectors that U.S. officials are trying to develop at home.

Chinese officials say that such accusations of overcapacity are groundless and that foreign governments are trying to suppress China’s development.

‘Reverse consumption’

The economic anxiety is on display all over China.

On social media, users share hacks to save money. Public libraries are filled with working-age people who are searching job sites and polishing résumés or who just need somewhere to go.

Young urban professionals also appear to be driving a surge in sales of lottery tickets, which reached a record 580 billion yuan ($80 billion) last year, according to data from the Finance Ministry. About 85% of purchasers were ages 18 to 34, compared with about 55% in 2020, the Chinese research firm MobTech reported.

Young people in China have to contend with a higher unemployment rate, which reached 14.9% in December for those ages 16 to 24, compared with 8% in the U.S., according to the Federal Reserve.

Chinese professionals who are further along in their careers also face job insecurity, some of them for the first time.

Many midcareer professionals worry that companies will shun them in favor of younger people. Fred Dufour / NBC News

Li Junwei, 39, lost her job as a manager at an internet company in Beijing early this year. “Many people in the same position as me and within the same age group have already been laid off,” she said.

Li, who said she was so dedicated to her job that she worked until the day her baby was born, discussed her experience in a video that was widely shared online. It resonated with midcareer professionals who worry that companies, particularly in the tech industry, will shun them in favor of younger people with lots of energy and fewer personal responsibilities, a concept referred to in China as the “curse of 35.”

“The common concern is that after dedicating a significant part of our youth to a company, when it comes time for the company to reciprocate and support our families, there’s a risk of being laid off,” Li said.

Li is exploring new possibilities for work, she said, “but whether they can materialize or sustain my family is still unknown.”

She said many of those who lost their jobs were leaving “first-tier” Chinese cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou for their hometowns, where “making ends meet shouldn’t be a problem” given their work experience.

Li has also considered returning to her hometown in Shandong province, but leaving Beijing could mean missing out on educational opportunities for her 3-year-old.

“If it doesn’t work out, I might go back to my small city and accept an ordinary life for my child,” she said. “This would be the last resort.”

Financial pressures are also fueling a trend called “reverse consumption,” in which consumers focus more on price and value for money than brand name. That has meant a hit for foreign luxury brands like Gucci, whose French parent company, Kering, warned of a steep drop in first-quarter sales last month due in large part to poor performance in the Asia-Pacific market.

Vika Chen, 29, said her spending philosophy is “to save where I can and spend where necessary.”

“When it comes to unnecessary expenses, I tend to prioritize items with better value for money or opt for cheaper alternatives,” said Chen, who works in public relations in Beijing.

She and her friends exchange clothes, shop wholesale or discount platforms and buy movie tickets from cheaper third-party sellers. Chen said she spends less on lunch these days and orders fewer items, but because her options are constrained by budgetary considerations she often eats from the same restaurant all week.

Chen said that it was a matter of mindset and that it was important not to compare oneself to others.

“For me, having a good mood makes me happier than living a luxurious lifestyle,” she said.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly damaging for small businesses, which represent the majority of businesses in the United States and employ nearly half of all private sector workers (Bartik, Bertrand, Cullen, et al. 2020; Small Business Administration 2012). Figure 1 shows how the different small business sectors have been affected by this downturn, highlighting severe declines in revenue among the leisure and hospitality as well as education and health services sectors. Compared to January 2020, average daily revenue as of August 9 was down by 47.5 percent in the leisure and hospitality sector, 16.4 percent in the education and health services sector, and 14.1 percent in the retail and transportation sector; aggregate small business revenue across all industries had fallen by 19.1 percent Some sectors where employees could not work remotely and where businesses were not deemed essential to be open fared particularly poorly (Papanikolau and Schmidt 2020). Notably, some of these sectors, after partially rebounding, have begun to see revenue declines again starting in August. For example, the percent reduction in revenue fell by more than 5 percentage points in the first 10 days of August in the retail and transportation sector as well as in the leisure and hospitality sector. In line with these declines in revenue, significant declines in employment at the beginning of the recession were seen in small businesses. Between March and April, employment in firms with fewer than 20 employees fell more than 16 percent; for firms with between 20 and 49 employees, the decline was 22 percent (Wilmoth 2020). Between August 30 and September 5, 50 percent of respondents had not rehired any employees, 5 percent of respondents had rehired at least one employee and 55 percent of respondents had not furloughed or laid off any employees (Small Business Pulse 2020). There is, of course, substantial uncertainty in these calculations. A major source of uncertainty is the extent of climate change over the next several decades, which depends largely on future policy choices and economic developments—both of which affect the level of total carbon emissions. As noted earlier, this uncertainty justifies more aggressive action to limit emissions and thereby help insure against the worst potential outcomes. Stabilizing business revenue is crucial—not only to avoid costly layoffs and firm closures, but also because reduced revenue will result in diminished investment, which can compound the future output and income damages of a recession (Boushey et al. 2019); for example, following declines in revenue during the Great Recession, real private nonresidential fixed investment fell 16 percent (FRED 2020c). For a Hamilton Project proposal on how to provide small businesses with relief in this crisis, see Hamilton (2020).

Fact 2: So far, only Chapter 11 bankruptcies have increased relative to last year.

The decline in business revenue has caused many firms to become insolvent. Hamilton (2020) estimates that by July nearly 420,000 small businesses had failed since the start of the pandemic, the number of failures typically seen in an entire year. Nevertheless, Wang et al. (2020) find that total bankruptcies are down 27 percent year-over-year between January and August. Breaking it out by type of filing, figure 2 shows how the filing of bankruptcies has changed since February 2020 from the same month last year. Chapter 11 bankruptcies—in which a plan for reorganization is negotiated—were down in February when the economy was relatively strong. Since March, such bankruptcies have regularly been between 15 percent and 50 percent higher than in the same month last year. Although larger firms benefit from entering into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in order to reorganize their operations, many smaller businesses opt for outright closures. Chapter 7 bankruptcies—in which the assets of the debtor are liquidated and used to pay creditors—decreased sharply from the same time last year in April and May and have remained below their 2019 levels through August. Finally, Chapter 13 bankruptcies—for individuals or sole proprietors who agree to pay a percentage of their income until creditors are paid off—have been down by about 60 percent from the same month in the previous year since April. Court closures resulting from the virus have had significant effects on bankruptcy filings, with many negotiation meetings cancelled, court proceedings delayed, and lawyers holding off on bringing large cases (Church 2020).1 In addition to logistical challenges that have likely delayed bankruptcies, many owners of businesses that are closed or suffering large reductions in revenue are likely waiting to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Firms that rely on financial institutions and markets for financing face curtailed access to credit (Federal Reserve Bank 2020). The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis finds that firms under those conditions during the Great Recession were more likely to declare bankruptcy. In all, conditions point to a coming wave of bankruptcies (Famiglietti and Leibovici 2020). Firm closures can sometimes be the result of efficient market reallocation (Barrero, Bloom, and Davis 2020). Indeed, Bartik, Bertrand, Lin, et al. (2020) show that small businesses that were struggling in 2019 were the most likely to close early in the pandemic and the least likely to reopen. Nonetheless, this crisis will no doubt lead to the failure of viable, productive businesses; letting these businesses fail is costly to the economy (Hamilton 2020).

Fact 3: New business formations fell off in the spring, but are on track to outpace recent years.

At the same time that business closures spiked in the spring, business formations lagged behind pre-crisis levels in the early months of the pandemic. More recently, business formations have begun to increase. Figure 3 shows how many new high-propensity businesses (i.e., those new businesses that are most likely to become employers) filed applications in recent years. By early June 2020 cumulative high-propensity business formations were 4.4 percent lower than they were at the same time in 2019; however, by mid-August there were actually 56 percent more new business applications than in mid-August 2019. Business formations tend to decline during recessions (Boushey et al. 2019); in the current recession, public health conditions worked to depress business formation as well. For example, Sedláček and Sterk (2020) find that states with a larger number of COVID-19 deaths tended to have fewer high-propensity business applications Since mid-summer, high-propensity business applications have rebounded. The Economic Innovation Group (EIG) offers three potential explanations for this recent increase: (1) there could have been a backlog in the processing of new business applications as a result of the same court closures discussed in fact 2, (2) newly unemployed persons might be starting their own businesses, and (3) some entrepreneurs could be trying to capitalize on potential reallocation or other opportunities occurring in the market (EIG 2020). There is some evidence that business creation has been boosted by demand for new kinds of goods: our analysis shows that many states with heavy manufacturing bases have seen the fastest rebounds (not shown). At the same time, 14 states still trail last year’s pace of business formation (Business Formation Statistics 2020; authors’ calculations). Continuity in business formation is critical for long-term growth. Sedláček (2020) finds that the “lost generation” of firms during the Great Recession led to significant output loss: if firm entry had remained constant instead of falling, the economy would have recovered four to six years earlier and the unemployment rate would have been 0.5 percentage point lower even 10 years after the trough. Long term, a 1 standard deviation shock to the number of start-ups (resulting in an initial decrease in start-ups of about 10 percent) results in a 1–1.5 percent drop in real GDP that can last 10 years or longer (Guorio, Messer, and Siemer 2016). For more on the significance of entrepreneurship and innovation in the U.S. economy, see prior Hamilton Project work (e.g., Shambaugh et al. 2018).

Fact 4: Layoffs and shutdowns—and not reduced average hours—are driving in total hours worked.

The labor market devastation caused by this pandemic has been the quickest and most severe in recent U.S. history. Many firms reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic by reducing their operations. Figure 4a shows the decline in total hours worked using data from Homebase, a firm that provides scheduling and time clock software to service-sector clients (e.g., food services, retail).2 Figure 4a shows the daily change in total hours worked from February through July, relative to a base period (January 19–February 1). The total number of hours worked fell by about 60 percent in March. While the number of daily hours began to rise again in mid-April, they leveled off at around 25 percent below baseline in June. Since then, aggregate hours have remained at between 25 and 30 percent of their baseline level. Figure 4b shows Bartik, Bertrand, Lin, et al.’s (2020) decomposition of the reduction in total hours from figure 4a into (1) average hours worked by a worker, (2) layoffs, and (3) establishment or firm shutdowns. Their analysis shows that, beginning in late March, the reduction in total hours was primarily driven by layoffs and establishment shutdowns. That is, the observed reduction in hours has not been driven by cutting hours among workers, but by reduced employment and temporary furloughs. Relatedly, worker recall is where much of the gain in hours has come since the April nadir. Cajner et al. (2020) find that the reopening businesses, especially small firms like those observed in the Homebase data, were major contributors to post-April employment gains.

Fact 5: The number of labor force participants not at work quadrupled from January to April.

During economic contractions, the share of the population that is employed declines. Figure 5 shows the number of workers in selected labor force statuses from January to July. From March to April, the number of prime-age people participating in the labor force but not working (i.e., either unemployed or employed but not at work) rose from 7.9 million to 19.6 million. That increase was largely driven by a 10.3 percentage point rise in the unemployment rate (FRED 2020d). As shown in figure 5, an unusual phenomenon in April and May was the surge in labor force participants that were counted as employed but not at work. These workers were either absent from work for a reason (e.g., vacation, child care) or absent from work for “other” reasons; recent research has suggested that this latter group largely misclassified themselves as being employed, suggesting an even higher share of the population was out of work (Bauer et al. 2020). Early in the recession, the majority of those who were not at work—either those who were unemployed or those employed but not at work—described their circumstances as temporary. Temporary layoffs are less damaging then permanent layoffs because they represent a much higher chance of reemployment since the employer–employee relationship is maintained (Fujita and Moscarini 2017; Nunn and Parsons 2020). In April, 10.1 million were unemployed on temporary layoff, 4.8 million were potentially misclassified as employed but absent from work for “other” reason, and 2.0 million were employed and absent from work for a specific reason. Altogether, these people represented 86.3 percent of prime-age labor force participants not at work in April. In May, June, and July, these three categories accounted for a smaller share of labor force participants who were not at work. Instead, a rising number of people not at work have classified themselves as being on permanent layoff. In April, the number who were unemployed due to a permanent job loss was 1.6 million, up only modestly from the number prior to the recession and representing 6.5 percent of those unemployed or employed but not at work. In July, 2.3 million were unemployed due to permanent layoff, which was 11.8 percent of those either unemployed or employed and not at work. More permanent layoffs suggest more people being unemployed for longer periods. Chodorow-Reich and Coglianese (2020) project that, by February 2021, 4.5 million individuals will have been unemployed for more than 26 weeks, and almost 2 million individuals will have been unemployed for more than 46 weeks. Long-term unemployment can lead to lower future earnings and reduced rates of homeownership (Cooper 2013).

Fact 6: The number of people not in the labor force who want a job spiked by 4.5 million in April and has remained elevated.

While many of the millions of people who are no longer employed are counted as unemployed (as highlighted in fact 5), a significant portion have dropped out of the labor force altogether. Figure 6 shows the number of persons not in the labor force but who say they want a job. The size of that group grew by 4.5 million in April, as the group includes those who lost their jobs in March and did not look for work in April (and thus were classified as not in the labor force). Within the group of people out of the labor force but who want a job, 6.0 percent reported being discouraged by their labor market prospects and 16.7 percent reported having another reason for not looking for work. The increase between March and April in those not in the labor force but who want a job was particularly large among adults of prime working age (25-54): 2.5 million (BLS 2020a; authors’ calculations). These numbers have remained elevated since April. To put this into context, the unemployment rate in August was 8.4 percent; however, using an alternative measure of unemployment that also includes people not in the labor force who want a job and are available to work—both discouraged and not discouraged workers (i.e., U-5)—the rate was 9.6 percent in August. Many of those reporting being out of the labor force but wanting a job have not been looking for work because of reasons that include child-care responsibilities, issues with transportation, or illness. The size of that group has risen steadily, from 867,000 in March to 1.8 million in June, but then fell slightly to 1.5 million in August. As highlighted in Stevenson (2020), disruptions in child care have led many working parents to drop out the labor force, a development that (without significant policy intervention) could have long-lasting negative effects on labor market outcomes for years to come. As was true before the pandemic, the majority of those not in the labor force do not want a job; not shown in figure 6 are the roughly 90 million Americans who said they did not want a job (BLS 2020a). This group, which consists largely of students, family caretakers, retirees, and people with illnesses, became larger in April and May, with some evidence suggesting that the pandemic pushed workers over the age of 54 into retirement. For example, among people who were employed in January but out of the labor force in April, 28 percent who offered a reason why they had left the labor force said they were retired (Coiboin, Gorodnichenko, Weber 2020).

Fact 7: In April 2020 the U.S. personal savings rate reached its highest recorded level.

One of the immediate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic was a sharp decline in aggregate spending and a sharp increase in savings. Figure 7 shows the personal saving rate, which is the ratio of personal saving to disposable personal income. The personal saving rate peaked at 34 percent in April, its highest level in recorded history. It has decreased since then but remains significantly elevated. That increase has been the result of both lower spending and greater federal transfer payments. Just as it did across the world (Andersen et al. 2020; Bounie, Camara, and Galbraith 2020; Carvalho et al. 2020), spending in the United States dropped following COVID-19–related shutdowns (Coiboin, Gorodnichenko, Weber 2020). Spending on many types of goods and services fell immediately as the pandemic emerged. Nevertheless, some categories of goods spending saw initial increases and most categories of goods spending have rebounded since March; for example, spending on groceries was strong early in the pandemic, with women, households with children, and older households stockpiling more supplies (Baker al. 2020). Although goods spending has recovered to pre-pandemic levels, spending on services remains sharply down through July (BEA 2020c). Through July, the saving rate was also boosted by stimulus payments to households, including unemployment insurance benefits and other federal transfers to households. As a result of those payments, even as millions of workers have lost their jobs, disposable personal income from March to July exceeded pre-pandemic levels (FRED 2020b). Although evidence suggests that many low-income households spent their stimulus checks immediately, other income groups said they planned to save the money (Baker et al. 2020; Chetty et al. 2020;), and low-income households were more likely to save their overall monthly income relative to prior periods (Bachas et al. 2020; Coibion, Gorodnichenko, and Weber 2020). Furthermore, Bachas et al. (2020) find evidence of sizeable growth in liquid asset balances for many households whom the federal support reached, suggesting the importance of the initial stimulus and insurance programs in limiting the effects of labor market disruptions on households’ financial positions. For low-income households whom the federal support has not reached, financial circumstances have been dire.

Fact 8: Low-income families with children were most likely to experience an income shock.

During the COVID-19 recession, job loss and labor income loss have not been experienced equally. Since March, low3-income households, non-white households, and households with children were most likely to experience an income shock (Monte 2020). Figures 8a and 8b shows these patterns in late July. About half of Black and Hispanic households experienced an income shock recently (see figure 8a). Hispanic families with and without children are most likely to experience an income shock. Lopez, Rainie, and Budimen (2020) found that 61 percent of Hispanic adults said in April that they or someone in their house had experienced a job or wage loss. Ganong et al. (2020) examine the racial gaps in consumption smoothing following an income shock, and find that the welfare cost of income volatility (i.e., how much a household cuts consumption following an income shock) is 50 percent higher for Black households and 20 percent higher for Hispanic households than it is for white households. More than three out of five low-income households with children reported that they had experienced an income shock due to COVID-19 (figure 8b; authors’ calculations). Income losses related to COVID-19 are associated with a host of material hardships, including food insecurity and difficulty paying bills (Despard et al. 2020). Families with children are also vulnerable to falling behind on obligations: each additional child in a household increases the likelihood of a serious delinquency (being at least two months behind on a current loan obligation) by 17 percent (Ricketts and Boshara 2020).

Fact 9: In 26 states, more than one in five households was behind on rent in July.

Although the increase in federal payments to households and unemployed workers has been relatively generous, it has not been able to cover all expenses for struggling households. Focusing on renters surveyed in late July, figure 9 shows that in 26 states more than one-fifth of renting households had not yet paid their rent for June, and that in five of those states (including New York) one-third of households had not yet paid their rent. According to a survey by Apartment List, missed payments were concentrated among young and low-income households as well as residents of densely populated urban areas. With late fees added on, households who miss a rent payment in a given month may be more likely to be unable to afford their next housing payment, creating a vicious circle of delinquency and putting households at risk for eviction (Adamcyk 2020). In addition, renters (as compared to home owners) are less likely to receive federal support for housing costs (Amherst Market Commentary 2020). For many households, unemployment coincided with having less than two month’s income in liquid assets and having high debt-to-income ratios (Kolomatsky 2020). In an April 2020 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, 73 percent of Black adults and 70 percent of Hispanic adults indicated that they did not have emergency funds to cover three months of expenses, compared to 47 percent of white adults (Lopez, Rainie, and Budimen 2020). Furthermore, Black and Hispanic respondents also said they would not be able to cover these expenses by borrowing money, using savings, or selling assets (Lopez, Rainie, and Budimen 2020).

Fact 10: From 2018 to mid-2020, the rate of food insecurity doubled for households with children.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, rates of food insecurity and of very low food security among households with children have increased (see figure 10). Food insecurity occurs when a household does not have sufficient food for its members to maintain healthy and active lives and lacks the resources to obtain more food. Very low food security is akin to hunger and captures whether there is a significant or consistent disruption in food consumption. Notably, the current levels of food insecurity are above their Great Recession peaks. Food insecurity is particularly high among households with children. In fact, it has doubled since before the pandemic, growing from roughly 14 percent in 2018 to about 32 percent of households in July 2020 (see figure 10). These rates are even higher for Black and Hispanic households (Schanzenbach and Pitts 2020), and Black and Hispanic households with children (Bauer 2020). Typically, families experiencing food insecurity are able to nonetheless maintain food security for their children; but this does not seem to be the case today (Coleman-Jenson et al. 2020). In June and July, rates of very low food security among children worsened, increasing from 16.4 percent in the first week in June to 19.0 percent by the third week of July. Several policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have supported households’ food security. Pandemic EBT, a disaster response program that provided the value of lost school meals to eligible households as a grocery voucher, reduced very low food security among children by 30 percent (Bauer et al. 2020). Unemployment Insurance receipt and SNAP emergency allotments also reduced food insecurity (Bitler, Hoynes, and Schanzenbach 2020; Raifman, Bor, and Venkataramani 2020).

With its flowing lines and striking façade, it is a monument to the boldness of modern Brazil.

I hope the G20 takes inspiration from this landmark to act boldly, too. With recent improvement to the global-near term outlook, G20 policymakers have an opportunity to rebuild policy momentum, setting their sights on a more equitable, prosperous, sustainable, and cooperative future.

After several years of shocks, we expect global growth to reach 3.1 percent this year, with inflation falling and job markets holding up. This resilience provides a foundation to shift focus to the medium-term trends shaping the world economy. As our new report to the G20 makes clear, some of these trends—such as AI—hold promise to lift productivity and improve growth prospects. We badly need it—our projections for medium-term growth have declined to the lowest in decades.

Low global growth affects everyone, but has particularly troubling implications for emerging-market and developing economies. These countries impressively weathered successive global shocks, supported by stronger institutional and policy frameworks. But their slowing growth prospects have made convergence with advanced economies even more distant.

Other factors contribute to the complex global picture. Geoeconomic fragmentation is deepening as countries shift trade and capital flows. Climate risks are increasing and already affecting economic performance, from agricultural productivity to the reliability of transportation and the availability and cost of insurance. These risks may hold back regions with the most demographic potential, such as sub-Saharan Africa.

Against this backdrop, Brazil’s G20 agenda highlights key issues such as inclusion, sustainability, and global governance, with a welcome emphasis on eradicating poverty and hunger. This ambitious agenda, which the IMF is working to support, can guide policymakers at this pivotal moment in the global recovery.

Finishing the Job on Inflation

Central bankers are rightly focused on finishing the job of bringing inflation back to target. That’s especially important for poor families and low-income countries who have been disproportionately hit by high prices. But the welcome progress on reducing inflation means that the question of when and how much to ease interest rates will need to be carefully considered by major central banks this year.

As core inflation remains elevated in many countries, and upside risks to inflation remain, policymakers must carefully track underlying inflation developments and avoid easing too soon or too fast.

But where inflation is clearly moving toward target, countries should ensure that interest rates are not kept high for too long. Brazil’s early and resolute response to surging inflation during the pandemic is a good example of how nimble policymaking can pay off. The Central Bank of Brazil was among the first central banks to raise its policy rate, then loosen policy as inflation fell back toward its target range.

Tackling Debt and Deficits

With inflation cooling and economies better placed to absorb a tighter fiscal stance, the time has come for a renewed focus to rebuild buffers against future shocks, curb the rise of public debt, and create space for new spending priorities. Waiting could force a painful adjustment later. But, for the benefits to be durable, tightening should proceed at a carefully calibrated pace.

Finding the right balance is tricky, with higher interest rates and debt-servicing costs straining budgets—leaving less room for countries to provide essential services and invest in people and infrastructure. Any push to bring down debt and deficits should be grounded in credible medium-term fiscal plans. It should also include measures to minimize the impact on poor and vulnerable households while protecting priority investments.

It’s also vital for countries to continue making important strides in raising revenue and weeding out inefficiencies. Brazil has shown leadership in this area with its historic VAT reform. But many countries are lagging, with scope to broaden their tax base, close loopholes, and improve tax administration. This is why the G20 has asked us to launch a joint initiative with the World Bank to help countries boost domestic-resource mobilization.

In addition, countries should aim to build more inclusive and transparent tax systems, ensuring the international tax architecture takes into account the interests of developing countries.

Our work also continues under the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable to come up with procedures to speed debt restructurings and make them more predictable. While progress has been made under the G20 Common Framework, with agreements on debt treatment by official creditors taking less time, faster improvements to the global debt-restructuring architecture may be required.

Growing the Economic Pie

Alongside monetary and fiscal measures that lay strong foundations, policymakers urgently need to address the drivers of medium-term growth.

In many countries, there are still opportunities to ease the most binding constraints to economic activity. For emerging-market economies, reforms in areas such as governance, business regulation and external sector policies could unleash productivity gains. But that’s only part of the story: economies must also prepare to harness structural forces that will define the coming decades.

Take the new climate economy. For some countries and regions, it will bring jobs, innovation, and investment. For those heavily reliant on fossil fuels, it could be more challenging. The question is how to maximize the opportunities and minimize the risks.

Policies to make polluters pay—such as carbon pricing—can create incentives to shift to low-carbon investments and consumption. IMF research shows that countries that take action on climate tend to stimulate green innovation and attract inflows of low-carbon technology and investment. Also, taxing the most polluting forms of international transportation could raise revenues that can be used to fight climate change, hunger and support the most vulnerable members of the population.

For many vulnerable countries, however, stronger growth alone will not be enough to realize their potential—they will need external support, both financial and technical.

This points to the importance of an international architecture that can meet the changing dynamics of the global economy.

A Stronger International System

As recent military conflicts have laid bare, we live in an increasingly polarized world. The tensions are fragmenting the global economy along geopolitical lines—around 3,000 trade-restricting measures were imposed in 2023, nearly three times the number in 2019. No country stands to gain from the splintering of the world economy into blocs. Restoring faith in international cooperation is critical.

In the eight decades since its founding, the Fund has continually evolved to meet the needs of its membership. Since the pandemic, we have deployed $354 billion in financing to 97 countries, including 57 low-income countries. With countries likely to face larger and more complex crises, countries must work together to reinforce the global financial safety net, with the IMF at its core.

Last year, our shareholders gave us a strong vote of confidence. Among other measures, they stepped up to meet our fundraising targets for the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust, which provides interest-free loans to low-income countries. And our shareholders agreed to increase our permanent quota resources by 50 percent. G20 countries can lead the way by quickly ratifying the quota increase, which will allow us to maintain our lending capacity and reduce our reliance on borrowed resources.

But we can—and must—do more. Our membership also recognized the importance of realigning quota shares to better reflect members’ relative positions in the world economy, while protecting the voices of the poorest members. With that goal in mind, we are developing possible approaches to realignment, including through a new quota formula. This comes in addition to a third chair for Sub-Saharan Africa on our Executive Board for election at this year’s Annual Meetings—an important step that complements the African Union’s new status as a permanent member of the G20.

In the years ahead, global cooperation will be essential to manage geoeconomic fragmentation and reinvigorate trade, maximize the potential of AI without widening inequality, prevent bottlenecks on debt, and respond to climate change.

As Oscar Niemeyer once said, “architecture is invention.”

The founding of the global economic and financial architecture was a courageous feat of collective invention that lifted the lives of millions. Now the challenge is to make it stronger, more equitable, more balanced, and more sustainable, so millions more can benefit. To reach that goal, we must channel that inventive spirit once again.","(3, 'inflation')"

Global economic activity is experiencing a broad-based and sharper-than-expected slowdown, with inflation higher than seen in several decades. The cost-of-living crisis, tightening financial conditions in most regions, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the lingering COVID-19 pandemic all weigh heavily on the outlook. Global growth is forecast to slow from 6.0 percent in 2021 to 3.2 percent in 2022 and 2.7 percent in 2023. This is the weakest growth profile since 2001 except for the global financial crisis and the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Global inflation is forecast to rise from 4.7 percent in 2021 to 8.8 percent in 2022 but to decline to 6.5 percent in 2023 and to 4.1 percent by 2024. Monetary policy should stay the course to restore price stability, and fiscal policy should aim to alleviate the cost-of-living pressures while maintaining a sufficiently tight stance aligned with monetary policy. Structural reforms can further support the fight against inflation by improving productivity and easing supply constraints, while multilateral cooperation is necessary for fast-tracking the green energy transition and preventing fragmentation.","(3, 'inflation')"

Unemployment is low, inflation is significantly down from its 2022 peak (if sticky and ticking up in the last month), wages are up, the stock market is hitting new all-time highs, and it looks like the Federal Reserve might be able to keep the US out of a recession.

Surveys are beginning to capture growing consumer confidence — but for President Joe Biden, the question is whether it’s rising quickly enough for him to avoid being penalized in the 2024 election.

He had no control over the pandemic-rattled economy he inherited, but voters may nevertheless blame him for it, as they have (rightly or wrongly) blamed their presidents for the country’s economic troubles in the past.

Voters have mentioned economic issues (think: inflation, jobs, and more) as their greatest concern since 2022 in a long-running and ongoing Gallup survey. Another February Morning Consult/Bloomberg survey of voters in swing states also found that the economy is the most important issue — and could therefore decide the outcome of the election.

Recent polls show Trump with an 11- to 20-point edge over Biden on which candidate would better handle the economy. In some ways, this isn’t a surprise: The economy was generally good under Trump, except for the Covid-induced recession; under Biden, high inflation has been the biggest economic story. If Biden is to turn his fortunes around, he’ll have to convince the American public that the economy is in fact better than it feels and will continue to improve — and that it’s better than they remember under Trump.

“The fundamental problem for Biden and the Democrats is that while the rate of inflation is down, it’s not going backwards,” GOP pollster Whit Ayres said. “It’s hard to persuade people that things are better.”

Americans think the economy is worse under Biden

Americans have been stubbornly downbeat about the economy under Biden, with Gallup’s Economic Confidence Index hovering between -20 and -40 for months on a scale of -100 to 100.

That number is derived from monthly surveys of US adults in which they are asked to rate national economic conditions, with 100 signifying that all respondents “say the economy is excellent or good and that it is getting better” and -100 signifying that they all “say it is poor and getting worse,” according to Gallup.

The data suggests that the more economic confidence has plummeted, the more the economy has become an issue in the presidential race. About 30 percent of Americans cited the economy as the most important problem facing the country in the most recent results from Gallup’s running survey (although it’s worth noting that immigration is now climbing fast on this chart).

To be sure, there’s evidence the link between the economy and presidents’ approval might be weakening as partisan loyalties shift — but it doesn’t appear to be gone entirely.

It does seem like things might be finally turning a corner for Biden. Surveys, including Gallup’s, have shown a marked uptick in economic confidence in recent months, even if the figures are still overall well below what Biden would like to see.

“There has been substantial empirical progress made,” Democratic pollster Fernand Amandi said. “I think if they continue making that case, the public, slowly and surely, will come around by the time they start voting in October and November for president.”

The Biden and Trump economies were both pretty good — but only one president has gotten credit

There’s no denying that the economy was good under Trump, and the 2019 pre-pandemic economy is now seen as a baseline against which Biden’s economy is being judged.

But Trump arrived in office when the economy was already pretty strong. He was “just riding on the coattails of a 10-year-long economic recovery,” said Alí R. Bustamante, deputy director of worker power and economic security at Roosevelt Forward, the progressive political arm of the Roosevelt Institute.

The economy continued to grow modestly on his watch until the pandemic hit in 2020, and after that, his stimulus checks kept it buoyant for a while. The stock market saw significant growth under Trump (and at least for the last year, under Biden, too — more on that later).

But some of Trump’s signature economic policies have also been found to have had little to no measurable effect on the economy — and a few might have even hurt. Multiple studies have shown that the Trump tariffs at best had a neutral effect on the economy and at worst cost America hundreds of thousands of jobs and higher prices for consumers. And his 2017 tax cuts, which increased investment in the economy and contributed to modest wage growth in the short term, fell far short of Republicans’ promise that they would pay for themselves and are projected to significantly raise federal debt and increase income inequality.

Biden, on the other hand, faced the immediate task upon assuming office of heading off a recession as the country started to bounce back from the pandemic. The US did recover from that pandemic economic slump. But there is evidence that his policies, including the stimulus checks he issued, contributed to an inflationary spiral.

The US did, however, manage to curb inflation faster than other economically developed countries, while also maintaining much lower levels of unemployment and higher wage growth.

The Federal Reserve might deserve most of the credit for that, given its carefully timed interest rate hikes. But Biden also has a very successful legislative record, including the bipartisan infrastructure law and the CHIPS Act — laws that experts say can help bolster the economy. And he took steps to reduce pandemic-induced pressure on supply chains, making it easier for truck drivers to become licensed and allowing some major ports to operate nonstop.

The US economy is growing faster than projected, driven largely by consumer spending and the Federal Reserve’s successful efforts to get inflation under control without triggering a recession.

While inflation has come down substantially from its 9.1 percent peak in June 2022, it still remains above the Fed’s target rate, and “ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured,” Fed chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers in early March. In February, inflation was higher than economists projected, at 3.2 percent, adding to the uncertainty.

But Americans’ wages are now growing faster than inflation, which should relieve some of the pressure of higher prices.

The problem for Biden is that the memory of peak inflation is still fresh, and not everyone has experienced wage growth equally. Bustamante said that younger workers and low earners account for the lion’s share of wage growth in the current economy.

The president should speak to these challenges, acknowledging that “some people are suffering and things are not exactly where they want it to be” without selling short what’s working, Amandi said.

What is working is Biden’s strategy on jobs.

Unemployment reached its lowest level since 1969 under Biden, and the US gained a record 7.27 million new jobs in 2021, fueled by a recovery in the labor market as vaccines became available and the country opened up. Job creation has remained strong in the years since, but slowed to 2.7 million jobs added in 2023.

The stock market has also been setting new record highs after growing a whopping 24 percent last year — driven by optimism that the Fed will soon cut rates and that companies in the tech and energy sectors have outperformed expectations.

This means that Trump no longer has the only claim to a strong stock market during the last few years. Instead, he’s had to resort to claiming credit (unconvincingly) for the current market. For instance, he recently posted on Truth Social that the US was experiencing a “TRUMP STOCK MARKET” in anticipation of him winning the 2024 election.

Biden’s challenge is speaking to Americans who are still hurting

The picture of the economy isn’t entirely rosy.

After a brief spike in savings rates during the pandemic due to a series of stimulus checks, Americans are now saving less than they were pre-pandemic. There are a few reasons for this: Of course, everything costs more, but interest rates are also higher, meaning that it’s now more expensive to borrow. And higher borrowing costs have eaten into Americans’ savings.

In spite of all of that, Americans are still buying stuff in droves, and not just necessities: Restaurants, airlines, and hotels have been some of the biggest beneficiaries.

There’s a question, however, of how long this can last before the money dries up.

Americans are pulling from their now-depleted savings and amassing record-high debt on credit cards and other revolving plans in which consumers can repeatedly borrow money up to a set limit and repay in installments. Young adults in particular, many of whom are also struggling with high student loan debt, are increasingly falling behind on their credit card payments. At some point, something has to give.

This might be part of the reason many Americans still yearn for the economy of 2019, when they had more cash on hand and didn’t have to resort to putting purchases on a credit card.

Still, Bustamante isn’t too worried about the long-term economic impacts, given that the Fed is expected to cut interest rates this year, which should provide relief to households carrying large balances and make it easier for them to pay off debt. But if the Fed waits much longer, Americans might not feel the effects before the November election.

So while most of the economic indicators spell good news for Biden and for America, the question is whether he can persuade voters who feel otherwise and remain nostalgic for Trump’s economy.

“The general perception is that the economy was better before the pandemic than it is now,” said Ayres, the GOP pollster. “And that perception is powerful politically.”

How we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand how the public views Joe Biden and the economy at the start of the new year. For this analysis, we surveyed 5,140 adults from Jan. 16-21, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology. Here are the questions used for the report and its methodology.

Americans’ views of the nation’s economy – while mostly stagnant for the past few years – are showing signs of improvement. Slightly more than a quarter (28%) rate economic conditions as excellent or good, a 9 percentage point increase from last April.

Virtually all the change since then has come among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. Currently, 44% of Democrats have positive views of the economy – the highest share of Joe Biden’s presidency.

The new survey by Pew Research Center, conducted Jan. 16-21 among 5,140 adults, finds that Biden’s own job rating remains highly negative: Just 33% of Americans approve of his job performance, unchanged from last month.

The economy, past and future; top concerns

Despite the improvement in economic attitudes, the public is far less upbeat today than it was from 2018 through early 2020, during Donald Trump’s presidency and prior to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.

Economic ratings remain far less positive than before the pandemic. In January 2020, 57% of Americans rated economic conditions as excellent or good; positive ratings fell to 23% in April of that year, as the coronavirus outbreak spread across the country. Views of the economy improved early during Biden’s first few months in office but declined subsequently.

The public’s future economic outlook turns less negative. The share of Americans saying economic conditions will be worse a year from now has fallen from 46% last April to 33% today.

However, more continue to say that conditions will be worse than better (26%) next year; 41% expect the economy will be about the same as it is today.

There’s less concern about energy prices and the stock market. A sizable majority of Americans (72%) say they are very concerned about prices for food and consumer goods, little changed from last year. The cost of housing also is a major issue, with 64% very concerned.

However, the shares expressing a great deal of concern about prices of gasoline and energy and how the stock market is doing have declined 9 points and 8 points, respectively, since last January.

In their own words: Americans on the economy

When the majority of Americans who rate economic conditions poor or only fair are asked why they feel this way, most point to inflation or high prices. Nearly half (45%) specifically mention high inflation (28%) or the high cost of living (21%); 11% specifically point to the high cost of food and groceries or the cost of housing.

People who view the economy positively – those who rate conditions as excellent or good – most often say low unemployment is a major reason why they feel the way they do (43% say this). Other factors cited are that inflation has come down (18%), wage growth (10%), or the strong performance of the stock market (9%).

Biden’s job performance, personal traits

Currently, 33% of Americans approve of Joe Biden’s job performance, while 65% disapprove. Biden’s job rating has not been above 40% since April 2022.

Young adults are negative about Biden’s job performance. Biden’s job rating is low across all age groups, including young adults. Just 27% of adults ages 18 to 29 approve of the way Biden is handling his job as president, while 71% disapprove.

Black adults are divided over Biden. About as many Black adults disapprove (49%) as approve (48%) of Biden’s job performance. Biden’s job rating is lower among Asian (39%), Hispanic (32%) and White (30%) adults.

Views of Biden’s personal traits have grown less positive. Biden gets his most positive ratings for being even-tempered (62% say this phrase describes him very or fairly well) and standing up for what he believes in (50%).

Far fewer Americans describe him as mentally sharp (29%), inspiring (26%) or energetic (24%). For the most part, perceptions of Biden’s personal traits have followed the same downward trajectory as his job ratings.

Judgments on Biden’s legacy

The share of Americans saying that Biden will be an unsuccessful president in the long run has increased steadily over the course of his administration.

Currently, 55% say he will be an unsuccessful president while just 23% say he will be successful; 20% say it is too early to tell. These opinions, like other views of Biden, are deeply partisan: Republicans overwhelmingly say Biden will be unsuccessful (87%).

Among Democrats, 45% say he will be successful, 26% say unsuccessful, and 28% say it is too early to tell.

Other findings on partisan compromise and the House GOP impeachment inquiry

A majority of Democrats (59%) say Biden should try his best to work with GOP leaders to accomplish things, even if that disappoints some of his voters; only 32% of Republicans say the same of GOP leaders trying to reach compromises with Biden. These opinions have changed little over the course of Biden’s presidency.

During the Trump administration, Democrats were less likely to say their party’s leaders should seek compromise with Trump than Republicans were to say their party should try to seek political compromise with Democratic leaders.

About half of Americans (52%) approve of House Republicans’ decision to conduct an impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden, while 45% disapprove. These opinions – and views about whether Biden has done anything that is grounds for his impeachment – are deeply divided along partisan lines: 85% of Republicans approve of the inquiry, while 77% of Democrats disapprove.

Relatively few Americans (16%) say they are following news about the impeachment inquiry launched by House Republicans into Biden’s conduct and possible connections to his son Hunter’s business dealings extremely or very closely.","(0, 'GDP')"

There is no denying the numbers: The United States currently enjoys the highest rate of economic growth among nations in the G7, the lowest inflation, and the strongest wage growth. The unemployment rate hasn’t been this low for this long in half a century. Even accounting for inflation, wages are higher today than they were before the coronavirus pandemic, and the biggest wage gains have accrued among the lowest-paid workers, resulting in a dramatic reduction in overall wage inequality. The economy is even outperforming among communities that are often excluded from boom-time gains. Biden has overseen the lowest Black unemployment rate on record and the lowest ever unemployment rate for workers with disabilities. The American economy isn’t perfect, but by any historical standard it is very, very good.

So, it’s remarkable that Biden finds himself needing to do so much persuasion on the campaign trail. Voter views on the economy are modestly improving, but survey after survey reveals a disconnect between the country’s economic performance and public sentiment. A recent USA Today poll shows that only one-third of voters believe that the economy is currently in “recovery.”

Economists and political messaging gurus have been trying to explain this for some time now, and while there are subtle differences among their various explanations, most ultimately argue that voters really, truly do not like inflation and are also a little confused when they talk about the economy.

There is surely something to both of these ideas—but there is a distinctly political tenor to Biden’s trouble on the economy that defies material conditions. Macroeconomic metrics have been improving steadily for a long time now—inflation peaked all the way back in the summer of 2022—and for much of that period, voter assessments of Biden’s performance actually deteriorated as the economy strengthened. Even today, when some voters say they like the economy, they remain reluctant to give Biden credit for it.

Much of this scenario can be laid at the feet of the Democratic Party. Not the official fundraising and administrative apparatus that runs conventions and formulates policy platforms, but the broad constellation of think tanks, nonprofits, academic experts, and journalists that collectively regulates the liberal intellectual atmosphere. For much of his presidency, Biden has been the victim of a centrist revolt against his economic program that the progressive wing of the party has been either unable or unwilling to put down. Everyone expects Republicans to give a Democratic president a hard time, but sharp and sustained economic criticism from Biden’s ostensible allies established a narrative of failure that has proved alarmingly resistant to reality.

Biden frequently draws distinctions between himself and the progressive left on police reform, immigration, and other issues where he thinks liberal ideas don’t fit the national mood. But this is not the way he has handled economic policy. From his first day in the Oval Office, Biden has embraced nearly every progressive criticism of Barack Obama’s approach to the economy, and translated those critiques into policy. Obama scoffed at labor unions; Biden walked a picket line and appointed the most pro-worker National Labor Relations Board in decades. Obama’s Education Department screwed over student debtors; Biden has canceled $138 billion in student debt. Obama defended big business; Biden has been an antitrust warrior. Obama was a free trader, while Biden subsidizes domestic manufacturing. Obama offered to cut Social Security; Biden just torched Republicans during his State of the Union for planning the same thing.

Advertisement

The list goes on. But the most important economic distinction between Biden and Obama is on crisis relief. The unemployment rate was high and rising when Obama entered office, escalating to 9 percent by April 2009, a level it would not retreat below for more than two years. When jobs did eventually return, most of those that were created paid poverty wages. The abysmal labor market made his presidency synonymous with the Great Recession.

Advertisement

The chief lesson Biden’s advisers took from this miserable experience was that the government didn’t spend enough in Obama’s 2009 stimulus package to get unemployment under control. More money would have meant more jobs, and more jobs would have put upward pressure on wages.

Advertisement

So Biden opted to spend much bigger out of the gate—$1.9 trillion to Obama’s $800 billion—and continued to secure additional rounds of support right up to the 2022 midterms. Obama began calling for budget cuts with unemployment still stuck above 9 percent, but Biden never pivoted to austerity, and ultimately secured well over $1 trillion in additional public investment after his initial stimulus bill had been enacted.

All this fiscal support resulted in a much stronger labor market. The unemployment rate fell below 5 percent by September 2021—a level Obama did not enjoy until the final days of his presidency—amid record wage growth for low-income workers. The economy never recovered all the manufacturing jobs it lost during the Wall Street crash. Biden had recovered all of those lost in the COVID collapse by May 2022. The COVID crash was sharper, deeper, and more physically disruptive to global trade than the 2008 Wall Street meltdown was, but the U.S. economy rebounded faster, stronger, and more equitably thanks to Biden’s more aggressive relief effort.

But not everyone was happy about this strategy at the time. When Biden signed his first economic relief bill into law in March 2021, former Obama adviser Larry Summers declared it “the least responsible macroeconomic policy we’ve had in the last 40 years” and upbraided “the Democratic left” for preventing a smaller package. All this spending, Summers claimed, risked a run of inflation. People were going to have too much money on their hands, and this excess spending power would lead to higher prices that made everyone poorer. When prices did indeed begin rising in the second half of 2021, the business press hailed Summers as a prophet, and a host of liberal commentators began tipping their hats to him.

Inflation arrived when the national mood was already in the toilet. Deadly car accidents were up, road rage incidents were soaring, and murder rates were rising. More people died from COVID-19 in 2021 than in 2020, even though vaccines were widely available. In monthly Gallup polling, Biden’s approval rating fell from 56 percent in June 2021 to 40 percent in January 2022, and all of this negativity made progressive institutions increasingly reluctant to claim credit for his approach to economic relief. Voters didn’t seem to care about Biden’s strong labor market—they were mad about inflation and everything else.

And so the economic commentary field remained open to Summers and other expert doomsayers—including some with politics well to Summers’ left. Economics dominated the news cycle in a way that it hadn’t since the banking crash, and seemingly everyone had something terrible to say about it. Biden wasn’t creating enough union jobs. His spending was really just a corporate welfare extravaganza. He was stealing jobs from Europe. There were too many regulations on manufacturers. There weren’t enough regulations on manufacturers. A recession was coming. A recession was already here. Some high-profile Democrats even insisted that a recession was necessary—on CNBC, former Obama and Clinton adviser Jason Furman argued that millions of workers would have to be laid off to get inflation back under control. Summers even floated the possibility of 10 percent unemployment.

To give all these haters their due, it really is hard to understand what is happening in the economy in real time, and even the best economists sometimes make predictions that look silly in retrospect. But what is remarkable about the Biden era is the degree to which critics on the left, right, and center basically agreed with one another beneath all the ideological dross. Almost everyone had come up with a way to argue that Biden had engaged in wasteful spending that left ordinary people behind.

Almost everyone. Throughout all this ugliness, a niche discourse continued in the econosphere about whether Summers had correctly nailed the cause of inflation. If Americans really were victims of overspending, then the only way to get inflation back down would indeed be to cause a recession. The problem, according to Summers and Furman, was that everyone had too much money. The solution was to take that money away.

But another camp argued that this was the wrong way to look at an economy that had just emerged from a massive shock like the COVID-19 pandemic. In this telling, inflation was driven not so much by an excess of consumer demand as by a dearth of product supply. It was a lot harder to make and distribute a whole host of goods when businesses around the world kept shutting down, and even once everything had fully reopened, it took a long time for companies to reestablish sources and connections. If supply shortages were indeed responsible for higher prices, then Biden’s spending was a feature, not a bug—it was the only thing standing between American households and the economic abyss.

Many economic disputes are vague enough to allow for essentially endless ideological stalemate over statistics, but in this case, a straightforward real-world test was available. Summers and Furman were arguing that layoffs were the only way to bring inflation down. If inflation fell without a flood of layoffs, then the rest of their diagnosis would have to fall with it.

In the American economy, policymakers typically induce job losses through the Federal Reserve. When the Fed raises interest rates, it’s trying to tamp down inflation by creating job losses: Higher rates mean higher business costs, and businesses lay people off in order to remain profitable. This was the Fed’s strategy when it began hiking rates in spring 2022.

The layoffs, however, refused to materialize. When inflation peaked at 9.1 percent in June 2022, the unemployment rate stood at 3.6 percent. Today, using the same metrics, inflation is just 3.2 percent, and unemployment is at just 3.9 percent. For 12 of the previous 19 months, the jobless rate has held steady at or below its June 2022 level, while inflation has been running below 4 percent since June 2023. Economists are still debating why the Fed’s higher rates didn’t translate into job losses, but the important point is that millions of people were not, in fact, fired. Moreover, millions of people did not need to be fired in order to fix inflation. As Mike Konczal concluded in a report for the Roosevelt Institute in September 2023, the vast majority of inflation during the Biden years was driven by pandemic-related supply problems. Whatever was going wrong in 2022, it wasn’t because you were too rich.

There is some evidence that the economic commentariat is coming to its senses as the 2024 election approaches. Some of the same centrists who ripped Biden’s stimulus package in 2021 are now applauding his recovery. The anti-Biden left has largely abandoned the economic playing field, finding cleaner grounds for criticism on other subjects. Contrary to the narrative abuse directed at Biden over the past few years, the economic numbers across his presidency tell a simple, optimistic story about the art of government in the democratic world. The American economy is strong today for the same reason that the labor market has been strong throughout Biden’s presidency: the U.S. government spent a ton of money to support workers and their families. Biden has not only established a blueprint for successful crisis management, but he has achieved something on the economy that pessimists across the ideological spectrum have been declaring impossible for much of the 21st century: He learned from the government’s prior mistakes and found a way to govern better.","(0, 'GDP')"

Pollsters and economists say there has never been as wide a gap between the underlying health of the economy and public perception. The divergence could be a decisive factor in whether the Democrat secures a second term next year. Republicans are seizing on the dissatisfaction to skewer Biden, while the White House is finding less success as it tries to highlight economic progress.

“Things are getting better and people think things are going to get worse — and that’s the most dangerous piece of this,” said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who has worked with Biden. Lake said voters no longer want to just see inflation rates fall — rather, they want an outright decline in prices, something that last happened on a large scale during the Great Depression.

“Honestly, I’m kind of mystified by it,” she said.

By many measures, the U.S. economy is rock solid. Friday’s employment report showed that employers added 199,000 jobs in November and the unemployment rate dropped to 3.7%. Inflation has plummeted in little over a year from a troubling 9.1% to 3.2% without causing a recession — a phenomenon that some once skeptical economists have dubbed “immaculate.”

Yet people remain dejected about the economy, according to the University of Michigan’s Index of Consumer Sentiment. The preliminary December figures issued Friday showed a jump in sentiment as people seem to recognize that inflation is cooling. But the index is still slightly below its July level.

In a possible warning sign for Biden, people surveyed for the index brought up the 2024 election. Sentiment rose dramatically more among Republicans than Democrats, potentially suggesting that GOP voters became more optimistic about winning back the White House.

“Consumers have been feeling broadly uneasy about the economy since the pandemic, and they are still coming to grips with the notion that we are not returning to the pre-pandemic ‘normal,’” Joanne Hsu, director and chief economist of the survey, said of the overall trend in recent months.

Jared Bernstein, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, stressed that a strong underlying economy is “absolutely necessary” to eventually lifting consumer sentiment. His argument is that as the economy continues to improve, more people will recognize the benefits and sentiment will improve.

“We’ve got to keep fighting to lower costs and build on the progress that we’ve made,” Bernstein said. “We just need more time to get these gains to working Americans — that’s our plan.”

The White House has made three major shifts in its messaging in hopes of building up confidence in Biden’s economic leadership. The president this summer began to pepper his speeches with the term “Bidenomics” to describe his policies, only to have Republicans latch onto the word as a point of attack.

White House officials have pointed out specific items for which prices have fallen outright. They noted lower prices for turkeys during Thanksgiving as well as for eggs. Biden repeatedly emphasizes that he lowered insulin costs for Medicare participants, while other officials discuss how gasoline prices have dropped from their peak.

Second, Biden recently started to blame inflation on corporations that hiked prices when they saw an opportunity to improve their profits, bringing more prominence to an argument first used when gasoline prices spiked. The president’s argument is suspicious to many economists, yet the intended message to voters is that Biden is fighting for them against those he blames for fueling inflation.

“Let me be clear: Any corporation that is not passing these savings on to the consumers needs to stop their price gouging,” Biden said recently in Pueblo, Colorado. “The American people are tired of being played for suckers.”

And Biden is now going after the track record of former President Donald Trump, the current GOP front-runner. Biden’s campaign sent out a statement after Friday’s employment report that said, “ Despite his claims of being a jobs president, Donald Trump had the worst jobs record since the Great Depression, losing nearly three million jobs.”

The Republican counter to Biden has been to dismiss the positive economic data and focus on how voters are feeling. As the annual inflation rate has fallen, GOP messaging has focused instead on multi-year increases in consumer prices without necessarily factoring in wage gains. And Republican lawmakers have argued that people should trust their gut on the economy instead of the statistics cited by Biden.

“Joe Biden’s message to them is just this: He says don’t believe your lying eyes,” Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming, said in a recent floor speech.

Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, put the blame solely on Biden for inflation and people feeling downtrodden.

“The challenge is rising cost of living,” said Youngkin, speaking at a Monday event in Washington hosted by Bloomberg News. “And it’s just clear over the course of now the last three years of the Biden economy we have seen inflation really run away from a lot of folks and 60% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.”

Biden’s speeches over the past two years have done little to improve his anemic polling on the economy. Administration officials had once assumed that better economic numbers would overcome any doubts among voters, only to find that the negativity stayed even as the U.S. economy became likely to avoid a recession once forecasted by economists.

Claudia Sahm, a former Federal Reserve economist, has been surprised by the anger generated online when she has noted the signs of a strong economy.

A typical U.S. household is better off than it was in 2020. Inequality has lessened somewhat in recent years as wage growth has favored poorer workers. Yet people still seem rattled and disconnected by the shock of the pandemic, the arrival of government aid and the inflation that followed as hiring improved.

“People have really been jerked around,” Sahm said. “Things have been turned on and off. Everything has moved fast. It’s been disruptive and confusing. We’re just tired.”

There is no solitary cause for this gap between the major data and public feeling. But the experts trying to make sense of things have multiple theories about what’s going on. Besides the pandemic’s impact, it’s possible that social media has distorted how people feel about the economy as they watch the posh lifestyles of influencers. Many people also judge the economy based on their own political beliefs, rather than the underlying numbers.

It could simply be that people need time to adjust after a period of rising inflation. As a result, there’s a lag before a slowing rate of inflation boosts how consumers feel, according to a recent analysis by economists Ryan Cummings and Neale Mahoney.

“Sentiment is still being weighed down by the high inflation we had last year,” Cummings said. “As that recedes further into the rearview mirror, its effects are likely to diminish.”

Another possibility is that the loss of pandemic aid from the government left people materially poorer. Millions of households got checks from the government and an expanded child tax credit deposited directly into their accounts. Republicans blamed this funding for feeding inflation, but the money also initially helped to shelter people from the pain of rising prices.

Adjusting for government transfers and taxes, the average annual income for someone in the lower half of earners was $34,800 when Biden took office, according to an analysis provided by Gabriel Zucman, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley.

That average fell to $26,100 by March 2023 in a sign that wage growth could not make up for the loss of government aid.

Samuel Rines, an investment strategist at Corbu, found that companies including Pepsi, Kraft-Heinz, Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark latched onto the higher food and energy prices after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine to boost their own products’ prices and increase profits.

Earnings reports suggest that consumers started to tire of some companies’ double-digit price increases this summer, prompting those companies to indicate that future prices increases will be closer to the historic average of 2%.

Biden can reasonably argue that companies took advantage of the war in Ukraine and the pandemic to raise their prices, Rines said. But the increases happened 12 to 18 months ago and Biden’s current argument doesn’t apply to what businesses are doing now.

Rines said of the president’s message on price gouging: “It’s pretty much 18 months too late.”

President Biden used his State of the Union address Thursday to highlight economic progress, eight months ahead of an election which will test voters' confidence in his economic stewardship.

""I inherited an economy that was on the brink,"" Biden told a packed chamber at the U.S. Capitol. ""Now our economy is the envy of the world.""

Polls show many voters disapprove of Biden's handling of the economy, despite strong job gains, low unemployment and faster GDP growth than many forecasters had expected.

Inflation has also cooled significantly since hitting a four-decade high in 2022. But high prices remain a source of frustration for many voters and a potential liability for the president.

The White House says lowering costs for working families is a top priority.

""We're cracking down on corporations that engage in price gouging or deceptive pricing from food to health care to housing,"" Biden said.

What the White House is doing

The president also highlighted his administration's efforts to combat hidden fees levied by banks, hotels and other businesses.

""I'm saving American families $20 billion a year with all of the junk fees I'm eliminating,"" Biden said.

The president accused Republicans of catering to wealthy business and individuals. His upcoming budget will propose higher corporate tax rates — a nonstarter in the currently divided Congress.

""A fair tax code is how we invest in the things that make a country great: health care, education, defense and more,"" Biden said. ""The last administration enacted a $2 trillion tax cut that overwhelmingly benefits the very wealthy and the biggest corporations and exploded the federal deficit.""

Biden's perception problem

Surveys by the University of Michigan show that consumer sentiment about the economy has improved in recent months, as inflation moderated and the stock market hit record highs. So far, though, that hasn't given a boost to the president's approval ratings. An average of polls from Real Clear Politics shows only about 4 in 10 people approve of Biden's handling of the economy.

""The president proudly proclaims Bidenomics is working! Bless his heart. We know better,"" said Alabama Sen. Katie Britt, who gave the official Republican response to Biden's speech. ""Hardworking families are struggling to make ends meet today. And with soaring mortgage rates and sky-high childcare costs, they're also struggling to plan for tomorrow.""

Wages have been climbing faster than prices for most of the last year, but workers have not yet fully recovered from the spike in inflation two years ago. The average worker's real buying power is slightly lower now than it was when Biden took office, although inflation-adjusted wages are higher than they were before the pandemic.

How the job market looks

Biden touted the strong job market, which has kept the unemployment rate under 4% for two full years — the longest such stretch since the Vietnam War.

Employers added more than twice as many jobs during Biden's first three years in office as they did during the comparable period under former President Donald Trump. The comparison looks worse for Trump if you count his final year in office, when the pandemic threw millions of people out of work. Trump was the only president since Herbert Hoover to leave the White House with fewer jobs in the U.S. than when he took office.","(0, 'GDP')"

A year ago today, President Biden entered office with a full agenda: a pledge not only to fight the pandemic and support economic recovery, but also to rebuild our economy to produce long-term and more widely-shared growth.

The President was inaugurated amidst a still-raging pandemic and a weak economic recovery. A year later, thanks to the rescue efforts of the Biden Administration, millions of Americas have protection from the worst of COVID-19, businesses have been able to resume activity, and children are back at their school desks. Economic recovery has been strong, with sharp increases in employment and GDP, alongside projected reductions in child poverty.

The Administration has not only succeeded in shepherding the economy through the pandemic ups-and-downs to date, but also in laying the foundation for future economic growth. Millions of workers and businesses have avoided the economic scarring so typical of severe recessions. Combined with the passage of a historic infrastructure bill, the groundwork has been laid for longer-term economic investments.

The work has just begun. Challenges remain: weathering the next phase of the pandemic, curbing inflation, and investing in long-neglected parts of our economy. But, the Administration is poised for the next chapter with its continued focus on protecting and investing in America.

America in January 2021

When President Biden took office, America faced a great deal of uncertainty and anxiety—about the pandemic’s path and the viability of the nascent economic recovery. On the day he was sworn in, COVID-19 had endangered people’s lives and impeded many families’ means of safely supporting themselves and their children for almost a year.

It was still unclear how well vaccines—new and out of reach for most Americans—would succeed in fighting the pandemic. By Inauguration Day, only 1 percent of the population was fully vaccinated. No one knew for sure whether vaccines would hold up, particularly as the virus mutated and unknown variants emerged.

The pandemic uncertainty also increased economic uncertainty. In just the one month before President Biden took office, the United States had lost 306,000 jobs, and there were still about 4 million workers who had been unemployed for more than six months. While private sector forecasters predicted the unemployment rate would decline over 2021, they believed the pace would be slow and end up at 5 to 6 percent at year’s end.

In addition, the United States still faced the issues that had contributed to decades of low and unequal economic growth. Inadequate Federal investment in research and infrastructure, decreasing competition, and a notable lack of support for America’s workers had resulted in an economy that worked for some but left many behind, especially people and communities of color. Therefore, while the economy needed immediate attention to fight the pandemic, it also needed reform to create stronger and more equitable economic growth moving forward.

Supporting the economy through the pandemic

The pandemic has posed one of the greatest economic challenges this country has ever faced. In addition to the pandemic being a fast and severe blow to economic activity, the ever-changing nature of the virus required economic policy to be nimble enough to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing outlook.

President Biden met the challenge. In his first year of office the Administration focused on rescuing a damaged economy—and the people it left in its wake—as the pandemic continued. The American Rescue Plan (ARP) was an insurance policy for the economy, businesses, workers, and families harmed by the economic uncertainty brought about by the virus. The ARP prioritized ensuring that there were enough resources to get and keep the recovery on track. Examples include support for households in the form of Economic Impact Payments (stimulus checks), expanded unemployment insurance, and the expanded Child Tax Credit; increased funds to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to help support small businesses; and flexible funds to State and local governments and school districts to fight COVID, keep schools open, and prevent cuts to services by State and local governments (a casualty during the Great Recession).

The ARP was crafted to address the extraordinary uncertainty of a global pandemic, supporting the economy and public health response as the virus evolved, often in unpredictable ways. The emergency measure worked, and the resulting pick-up in economic growth in 2021 has been extraordinary. The unemployment rate has come down much faster than forecasters predicted and GDP growth has been stronger than they anticipated at the start of the year. Labor force participation also rose substantially: prior to the pandemic, the economy had not seen a twelve-month increase in prime-age (25 to 54) labor force participation exceeding 0.9 percentage point since the mid-1980s.

Moreover, the long-term unemployment rate has been cut in half since December 2020. In comparison, during the Great Recession it took around four years for the long-term unemployment rate to fall that quickly. Long-term unemployment is typically one of the most difficult and pernicious economic challenges coming out of downturn, as those who have been unemployed for more than 6 months often struggle to find work. Given that, the rapid improvement in long term unemployment in 2021 is astonishing.

It is also remarkable that in a year of loss and unprecedented hardships, the poverty rate (as measured by the Supplemental Poverty Measure) is expected to have reached a record-low level of 8.5 percent in 2021.[1] For the first time ever, the poverty rate of children is projected to be lower than that of the general population, also approaching a historically low level of 5.9 percent. Furthermore, these reductions are projected to be widely shared, with hundreds of thousands of adults and children of all races lifted over the poverty line last year.

These short-run rescue measures do not just affect economic growth in 2021; in fact, they are an important way the Biden Administration has supported long-run economic growth. By making up for family income lost due to the pandemic, supporting the unemployed, and reducing child poverty, the rescue agenda prevented much of the long-term scarring—what economists call “hysteresis”—that can be a persistent drag on long-run growth after deep recessions.

In fact, the International Monetary Fund now believes the U.S. economy will be larger in 2024, with higher employment, than it predicted prior to the pandemic. Without action from policymakers, long-term growth potential may well have been held back due to scarring or insufficient investment. By providing extraordinary support for Americans in the dark days of the pandemic, the Biden Administration helped lay a strong foundation on which to build a better economy for the future.

Rebuilding for sustained and shared growth

Helping families and businesses weather the pandemic and prevent long-term scarring from its economic harms is not enough, however, to ensure a strong and equitable economy going forward. A dearth of needed Federal investment has held back growth and well-being in the United States for decades. Thus, returning the United States to a path of sustainable, inclusive growth is a critical part of the Biden Administration’s legislative agenda. A historic step toward this goal was this year’s enactment of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (now known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law or BIL), which provides long overdue investment in our nation’s physical infrastructure.

The BIL is focused on rebuilding our nation’s infrastructure and fighting climate change, which includes investing in roads and bridges, clean water, and access to broadband. It makes investments in upgrading U.S. ports and waterways, closing technological gaps between U.S. and foreign port infrastructure. It further invests $66 billion in railways, which handle about 28 percent of domestic freight transportation and have also been under significant strain. By strengthening America’s goods transportation system, these public investments will encourage private businesses to invest and hire workers, particularly in manufacturing. Unlike the ARP, which was short-run stimulus and insurance designed to be spent out over the course of the pandemic emergency, the BIL will be spent out over years, building and strengthening the foundation our economy needs to increase its productive capacity.

President Biden has also taken Executive action to strengthen the U.S. economy. For instance, in July, the Administration issued an Executive Order aimed at increasing competition in markets in the United States. Concentration has increased in over 75 percent of U.S. industries since the late 1990s (as discussed at-length in a previous CEA piece), and the profits and markups of the largest firms—indicators that many economists point to as aggregate measures of market power across the economy—have grown over the last 30 to 40 years. For instance, in 1977, the largest four beef-packing firms controlled 25 percent of the market, compared to 82 percent today. Over 80 million (or about 25 percent of) Americans have access to only one broadband provider.

When there is insufficient competition, dominant firms can use their market power to charge higher prices, offer decreased quality, and block potential competitors from entering the market—meaning entrepreneurs and small businesses cannot participate on a level playing field, and new ideas cannot become new goods and services. Market power is connected to inequality; in an economy without adequate competition, prices and corporate profits are elevated, while workers’ wages are depressed. This means large corporations and their shareholders have increased wealth compared to a more competitive equilibrium, while consumers and workers pay the cost. Thus, this Executive Order is aimed at bringing the weight of the Federal government to bear on an issue that has remained largely unaddressed for decades.

As another example, the Administration issued a first of its kind Executive Order on racial equity aimed at advancing equity throughout the Federal government and finding ways through agency action to achieve that goal. Improving equity in our economy can increase our productive capacity by ensuring that everyone is achieving their full potential. As one example, Mary Daly and co-authors estimate that the cost to the economy of racial and ethnic economic inequality was over $20 trillion in the past 30 years. Similarly, the Administration undertook historic strides in ensuring the full participation of women in all aspects of society, including in the economy. These include the establishment of the White House Gender Policy Council and the creation of the first-ever National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality. Supporting women, who make up more than half of the U.S. population, advances the nation’s full economic potential.

There were many other administrative actions taken this past year to improve the foundation for long-run economic growth. For instance, President Biden called for an all-of-government approach to address climate change, which presents a huge threat to the future of stable and strong economic growth (discussed in a previous CEA issue brief). By the end of this century, the increase in global average temperatures could surpass 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit), which one recent meta-analysis finds could cause damages equal to 7 to 11 percent of annual global GDP year-after-year and create systemic risks to environmental, human, and economic systems. The Administration brought the automobile industry and the United Auto Workers together to commit that by 2030, half of all light vehicles sold would be electric, and the Environmental Protection Agency finalized Federal greenhouse gas emissions standards for passenger cars and light trucks for Model Years 2023 through 2026. These standards leverage advances in clean car technology to unlock up to $190 billion in net benefits to Americans—including reducing climate pollution, improving public health, and saving drivers money at the pump.

The Administration also issued an Executive Order increasing the minimum wage to $15 for workers on Federal contracts. Raising the minimum wage helps workers at the bottom of the income distribution by increasing earnings growth. Importantly, the economic literature suggests it may also increase worker productivity and reduce turnover, both benefits to employers.

These are but a few examples of important accomplishments in the first year of the Biden Administration that should lay the foundation for stronger, more inclusive economic growth going forward.

Challenges ahead

Despite the substantial policy successes of 2021 and the extensive economic recovery, we cannot come out of two years of one of history’s most extraordinary crises without facing additional challenges. One of the most serious is inflation. Price growth in the Consumer Price Index as of December 2021 was 7 percent year-over-year. The pandemic itself has been a major driver of inflation. The pandemic necessitated critical support for the economy which fostered strong consumer demand. Further exacerbated by a shift from services to goods, this put unprecedented pressure on global supply chains, which were already strained by the impact of the pandemic. While private-sector forecasters foresee price growth moderating in 2022 and beyond, high inflation is a burden for American families today. There is also ongoing uncertainty about energy and food prices, which are volatile and affected by a number of global factors, including weather and geopolitical events.

The principal means to reduce inflation, of course, rests with the Federal Reserve in the context of their dual mandate. Notwithstanding the Fed’s leadership and importance, however, there are also important steps that the President and Congress can take to help families deal with costs, especially through measures that aim to expand the productive capacity of the economy over the short-, medium-, and long-term.

The most serious short-run threat to our productive capacity is the pandemic itself, and so policies to address the virus ought to be seen not only as public health actions, but also as economic capacity measures. The labor force, supply chains, and businesses are still being impacted by the challenges that come with high virus caseloads. For instance, if it was no longer the case that any worker was out of the workforce or unable to work due to COVID, the gap between the prime-age employment rate and its pre-pandemic level would close by about 25 percent. That fact speaks to the importance of the pandemic in the labor force disruptions that families and businesses are currently experiencing.

In addition, there are still investments in the long-run growth potential of the economy that must be made, addressing problems and shortfalls that pre-date the pandemic. For decades, our economy has lacked policies that invest in our people, including those that facilitate labor supply and provide investments in children. History teaches us this is not the right path. Investments made in the early 20th century in universal primary and secondary schooling drove growth throughout that century. The United States developed a highly skilled labor force, and established some of the best universities in the world.

Yet, the United States has now fallen behind. As one measure, the United States ranked 35th in math and 11th in reading in the 2018 OECD Programme for International Student Assessment. Research and employment projections indicate that demand for the kinds of postsecondary skills provided by higher education has increased and will likely continue to do so. One paper documents that the share of employment in professional, technical, and managerial occupations—high-paying occupations typically associated with at least some college education—grew from around 30 percent in 1970 to 46 percent in 2016. Estimates are that nearly half of net job creation between 2020 and 2030 will be in occupations that require at least some postsecondary schooling at the entry level, and two out of five will require at least an AA degree.[2] Investments in Pell grants, community colleges, HBCUs, and other education and training can help workers move into higher-paying jobs.

Similarly, there is evidence that the United States has fallen behind our economic competitors because of a failure to implement policies that allow families to address tensions between work and family life. Labor force participation in the United States for people ages 25 to 54 peaked at more than 84 percent in 1999, but has since slumped through three recessions and never again reached that level. Research shows that workplace supports, such as access to affordable, high-quality childcare and paid leave, are associated with higher labor force participation and job retention among caregivers, particularly mothers.

Some of these investments would both increase economic capacity moving forward and help with some of the labor supply issues the economy is currently facing. For instance, paid leave and childcare are not only important for long-term economic growth, but would also help ameliorate some of the pandemic disruptions that have held back labor force growth. Similarly, immigration would help improve economic growth and also provide needed support during the pandemic.

It is important that we stop neglecting these important investments, as the President’s agenda attempts to do, in order to ensure strong, sustained economic growth moving forward.

Conclusion

Given the uncertainty around the pandemic and the economy at the beginning of the year, economic progress was not pre-ordained. But thanks in large part to the rescue and investment actions taken by the Administration, the last year has seen unprecedented improvement in our economy and important investments made in its future productive capacity. Effective economic policy has supported families, workers, and businesses, and in doing so, likely averted long-term scarring that would have undermined economic growth in years to come. The Administration has made additional investments in sustainable economic growth through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and executive actions such as those aimed at promoting competition and addressing racial inequity. Challenges remain, but substantial down payments have been made on investments in long-term growth, laying the foundation for stronger and more widely shared prosperity for decades to come.

But how do their claims stack up?

The presidential election is less than a year away, and economic issues are once again top of mind for voters around the country. Despite the economy’s rapid recovery from the pandemic, President Biden has struggled to convince Americans that his policies are improving their finances. In polls, the majority of Americans still say they trust former president Donald Trump’s handling of the economy over Biden’s.

Both presidents’ economic records have been defined by the pandemic and its aftershocks. The covid crisis upended the job market, stoked decades-high inflation and added trillions of dollars to the federal debt.

The economy today is vastly different than it was in 2017, when Trump took office. But the data shows just how each administration has left its mark: Biden, by adding 14 million jobs in less than three years, bringing the Black unemployment rate to a record low and reducing student loan debt by billions. Trump, meanwhile, presided over a period of low inflation, low interest rates and low gas prices.

Here are 12 charts showing the state of the economy now vs. under Trump.

1. Job gains

The astoundingly strong labor market is arguably the White House’s biggest victory. In some ways, the bump was inevitable — Biden took office at a time when millions were still out of work because of the pandemic. Even so, the rapid job gains in recent years have blown past economists’ expectations and have fueled the economy’s blockbuster growth.

Even more remarkable is that the labor market has remained strong, despite the Federal Reserve’s aggressive efforts to slow the economy. As long as Americans are employed, they’ve been able to withstand inflation and keep spending, allowing the economy to grow.

Employers have created more than 14 million jobs during the Biden administration, with a monthly average of more than 400,000 positions. Recently, though, the pace of job creation has slowed, with 216,000 new jobs in December.

By contrast, the economy added an average 176,000 jobs a month during Trump’s first three years, before coronavirus-related closures and layoffs resulted in the sudden loss of more than 20 million jobs.

2. Unemployment rate

Aside from a covid-fueled surge in much of 2020 and 2021, the national unemployment rate has remained low through both Trump’s and Biden’s presidencies.

Joblessness fell during the Trump years to a half-century low of 3.5 percent in early 2020, just before the pandemic. During Biden’s presidency, the unemployment rate has inched down even further, to 3.4 percent earlier last year. It now stands at 3.7 percent.

The years-long pickup in hiring has been particularly good for workers who are typically underrepresented in the labor force. Unemployment rates for Hispanic workers, Black women and people with disabilities have all hit record lows under Biden’s watch.

The Black unemployment rate, which Trump liked to take credit for improving during his presidency, fell during both administrations, but reached an all-time low during the Biden era last year.

3. Economic growth

For the most part, the U.S. economy has expanded at a steady pace under both Trump and Biden. Gross domestic product, a measure of all of the goods and services produced in the country, has grown about 22 percent since Biden took office. That’s compared with a 14 percent uptick during Trump’s presidency, when the pandemic forced the economy into a steep and sudden recession. Even so, the economy rebounded quickly — thanks in part to trillions in stimulus money — and was growing again by the time Trump left office.

Now, under Biden, the economy has notched five straight quarters of growth following a six-month slump last year. The latest expansion has been powered by heavy consumer spending, which makes up about 70 percent of the economy, and new infrastructure and green-energy projects spearheaded by the Biden administration. But economists note that the current rate of economic growth — an annualized rate of 4.9 percent, as of September — is unsustainable, and many expect growth to cool next year.

4. Gas prices

Presidents have very little control over gas prices. But this is one area where the Trump era was better for Americans — and could help explain some of the gloom Americans are feeling now.

Pandemic-related hiccups, the war in Ukraine and spikes in demand have all sent gas prices on a dizzying roller-coaster ride since 2020. Gas prices more than doubled between April 2020 and April 2022, from $1.84 a gallon to $4.11. They peaked at an all-time high of nearly $5 a gallon in June 2022 but have come down since. Analysts say gas prices could fall below $3 per gallon in the coming weeks, thanks to a combination of increased production and slowing demand.

Gas prices have a direct effect on how Americans view the economy, and higher prices at the pump have translated to lingering pessimism for much of Biden’s presidency.

5. Home prices

Homeownership is one of the biggest ways Americans create wealth, and the recent run-up in prices has been a double-edged sword: Many first-time home buyers been shut out of the market, but people who already own homes have benefited from soaring property values.

On the whole, though, homeownership has become far less accessible during the Biden administration. Home prices surged during the pandemic, rising an eye-popping 49 percent between spring 2020 and fall 2022. Those higher costs have driven housing affordability to all-time lows, according to Goldman Sachs. Homes are selling for a median price of $431,000 — less than the $480,000 they were commanding last year, but still well over pre-pandemic norms.

Mortgage rates have more than doubled in the past two years — from about 3.1 percent to about 7 percent — making it that much pricier to purchase a home and putting a chill on the market. Prices, though, remain high because demand for homes continues to outpace supply.

6. Inflation

Inflation has been a persistent challenge for the Biden administration. A rapid run-up in prices after the pandemic resulted in the highest inflation in more than 40 years. Americans have been pinched by higher costs for just about everything, including groceries, gas, cars and health care.

Although inflation has recently come down from last summer’s peaks, prices are still about 3 percent higher than they were a year ago. Many Americans say higher costs have tainted their views of the economy, with voters consistently citing inflation as their top economic concern.

7. Interest rates

The president has very little power over interest rates. While the Federal Reserve’s chair and governors are appointed by the president and confirmed by Congress, the central bank operates independently.

But the Fed’s actions have a far-reaching impact on the economy. During Biden’s presidency, the central bank has raised interest rates 11 times as part of its effort to rein in inflation. The bank controls the federal funds target range — the interest rate banks use to lend money to each other overnight — which, at 5.25 to 5.5 percent, is at its highest level in 22 years.

Each time the Fed raises that rate, or even hints that it might, there are ripple effects across the economy, resulting in higher borrowing costs for loans of all types, including mortgages (currently about 7 percent), personal loans (12 percent, according to Bankrate) and credit cards (above 20 percent).

8. Disposable income

Americans have less spending power than they did at the beginning of Biden’s term. A drop-off in stimulus money, plus rising prices, have caused large swings in household income since 2020. Still, many Americans are starting 2024 better off than they were a year ago, as wage gains outpace inflation.

Share this article Share

During the Trump years, by comparison, Americans saw a steady increase in spending power until the start of the pandemic. Overall, real disposable income, or what Americans are left with after taxes and inflation, rose about 10 percent between January 2017 and January 2020.

9. Stock market

The stock market rose rapidly during Trump’s presidency and has continued its ascent under Biden. After a period of slowing last year — in anticipation of higher borrowing costs and increased volatility — stock prices have picked back up on optimism that the Fed is done raising interest rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq hit all-time highs last month, and the Standard & Poor’s 500 is on track to follow suit.

Trump kept a close eye on the stock market’s path during his presidency, often taking to social media to flaunt his successes. He also warned Americans that a Biden presidency would result in a “stock market collapse the likes of which you’ve never had.”

That has not happened — which the president was quick to note. “Good one, Donald,” Biden recently fired back on X.

10. Student loan debt

Outstanding student loan balances have been climbing for nearly two decades — until now.

Biden took office vowing to whittle down the debt burden on student and graduates. And while his most ambitious plans, including a $400 billion forgiveness plan, have been blocked by Republican lawmakers and the Supreme Court, his administration has found ways to offer relief.

To date, the White House has canceled some $132 billion in student loan debt for more than 3.6 million Americans. It has also increased federal Pell Grants to low- and middle-income students, allowing them to take on less debt. As a result, outstanding student loan balances have been falling for six months. Americans owed $1.74 trillion in student loans in October, down from a record $1.77 trillion at the beginning of the year.

11. Consumer sentiment

Despite the economy’s strength, Americans appear downright despondent when it comes to their finances during Biden’s tenure. Consumer sentiment dropped to its lowest level, ever, in June 2022, when gas prices were at a record high. Since then, sentiment has rebounded somewhat but remains lower than it was when Trump was president.

But although they say they feel crummy about the economy, Americans are continuing to spend heavily. That spending — on a variety of goods and services, including cars, travel and dining out — has helped power the economy and keep it growing.

12. Federal deficit

The federal deficit peaked under Trump, though both he and Biden have added trillions to the national debt. The national deficit — or the gap between what the government brings in and what it spends — grew every year of Trump’s presidency. Sweeping tax cuts, followed by the government response to the pandemic, added an unprecedented $7.8 trillion to the country’s debt.

Since then, the deficit narrowed in the first two years of Biden’s presidency. But this year it grew again, by 23 percent, leaving the country with a $1.7 trillion shortfall.","(0, 'GDP')"

A recent CBS News poll found that 65% of Americans remember the economy under former President Donald Trump as being good, compared with 38% giving the current economy under President Joe Biden the same positive assessment.

On Super Tuesday, Biden and Trump won commanding victories across nearly all the states holding Democratic and Republican nominating contests, according to CBS News projections. That is solidifying the likelihood of a general election rematch between the two in November.

In fact, almost 6 in 10 voters polled by CBS News described the U.S. economy under Biden as bad, even as economists' views are much more upbeat due to the nation's stronger-than-expected GDP and low unemployment. Instead of entering a recession, as many economists had predicted last year, the economy appears to be on track to generate continued growth and more jobs while inflation recedes.

The key to the disconnect could reside in how voters experienced the economy between 2017 to 2019, during the first three years of Trump's presidency, prior to the pandemic's upheaval in 2020, compared with the post-pandemic years.

""These are two very different periods from an economic standpoint,"" noted Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY. ""The 2017-2019 period was the end of the longest business cycle on record — the economy was doing well, the labor market was quite strong. We had the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years, we had an economy growing at a sub-2% rate but still moving forward.""

Overall, he added, ""There was essentially a pretty steady state of the economy before the pandemic.""

In other words, the economy prior to the pandemic was chugging along, providing a strong if not stellar environment. But the post-pandemic economy introduced a number of upheavals, including a labor shortage and the highest inflation in 40 years — which has since receded but remains above its pre-pandemic levels.

""There is that sentiment that you are still coming out of a shock,"" he added.

To be sure, presidents often get credit when the economy is performing well and are blamed when it tanks, even though there's a limit to how much influence the commander in chief has over such a complex system. Indeed, the economy's performance is often tied to boom-and-bust cycles that don't have much to do with who's occupying the White House.

Here's what the data shows about the 2017-2019 economy under Trump versus the 2021-2023 economy under Biden.

Inflation

The major difference between the two periods boils down to inflation, or the upward change in prices for goods and services.

From 2017 to 2019, inflation hovered at about 2% per year – a low enough level where people generally don't notice changes from day to day. But when COVID-19 shut global supply chains and caused a labor shortage, prices shot up, with inflation hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022.

Suddenly, shoppers were reminded of inflation each time they went to the grocery store – an issue that remains a pain point for consumers. Even though inflation has receded, prices aren't going back to their pre-pandemic levels, and that continues to eat into consumers' budgets.

""We're coming out of an environment where inflation has become a key topic, a key issue, a key point of conversation, whereas it wasn't for most of the three decades that preceded the pandemic,"" Daco noted. ""It's gone from a non-issue to an essential issue, and that for me is the key reason people are feeling more downbeat than economic conditions would dictate.""

Consumers value predictability when it comes to prices, something that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell highlighted when he spoke with CBS News last month.

""I can't overstate how important it is to restore price stability, by which I mean inflation is low and predictable and people don't have to think about it in their daily lives,"" Powell said. ""That's where we were for 20 years. We want to get back to that.""

Wages

Wages rose at about 3% annually prior to the pandemic, representing solid gains, yet far from the strides of the late 1990s, when workers enjoyed pay bumps of about 5% annually.

But more importantly, wage growth from 2017 to 2019 inched ahead of inflation, providing American workers with more purchasing power.

That flipped in the wake of the pandemic, when wage growth failed to keep up with inflation. Suddenly, workers were losing purchasing power, an issue they encountered on every grocery trip, when they faced sky-high egg prices and more costly basics. With wages trailing inflation, many felt they were losing ground.

The good news for workers: Wages started trending ahead of inflation about a year ago.

GDP

One strength of the post-pandemic period has been better-than-expected gross domestic product, or the economy's total output of goods and services.

While voters may not notice GDP on a personal level, a growing economy enables companies to expand and hire more workers. Businesses can also afford to pay higher wages when they have more demand for their goods or services.

Importantly, the economy so far has dodged a recession, which many economists had predicted would occur as a result of the Federal Reserve's flurry of interest rate hikes, which typically cause businesses to pull back on spending, given the higher cost of borrowing.

""Like the Energizer Bunny, the U.S. economy just won't quit,"" Oxford Economics said in a January report on GDP.

Grading the Trump versus Biden economies

Many economists today say the U.S. is showing surprising economic resilience, dodging a recession and continuing to add jobs.

But, Daco noted, the economy is still recovering from the shock of the pandemic. And Americans are also facing other changes, such as higher interest rates — a result of the Federal Reserve's battle against inflation — which means it's more expensive now to buy a home, car or make any purchase with debt versus during Trump's presidency.

The economy in 2019 ""was an A economy,"" Daco said. ""It was growing at a steady state.""

The economy now? ""It's a B on track to an A,"" he added. ""It's progressing, but we're not quite there yet.""","(0, 'GDP')"

President Biden wants to know why so many Americans are still feeling bad  CNN,"Tue, 06 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDIvMDYvcG9saXRpY3MvdGhlLXVzLWVjb25vbXktaXMtZG9pbmctd2VsbC1wcmVzaWRlbnQtYmlkZW4td2FudHMtdG8ta25vdy13aHktc28tbWFueS1hbWVyaWNhbnMtYXJlLXN0aWxsLWZlZWxpbmctYmFkL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAZIBaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wMi8wNi9wb2xpdGljcy90aGUtdXMtZWNvbm9teS1pcy1kb2luZy13ZWxsLXByZXNpZGVudC1iaWRlbi13YW50cy10by1rbm93LXdoeS1zby1tYW55LWFtZXJpY2Fucy1hcmUtc3RpbGwtZmVlbGluZy1iYWQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,CNN,"Washington CNN —

By many metrics, the US economy is humming along. The jobs market is robust; consumers are spending again; and inflation has eased to a three-year low.

That has prompted President Joe Biden to repeatedly ask his advisers: Why then are so many Americans still not feeling great about the economy?

The significant gulf between a string of positive economic indicators and the public’s stubbornly grim sentiment about the US economy has been the subject of the president’s frequent inquiries when he has spoken with members of his economic team in recent weeks and months, sources familiar with those discussions told CNN.

That disconnect looms large over Biden’s political prospects, with White House advisers and campaign officials acknowledging that how Americans feel about the economy could be decisive in determining whether the president can win a second term in November.

Inflation began to spike early in the president’s term and has consistently proved to be one of Biden’s most persistent political problems. While inflation has eased in recent months, prices on most goods are still higher than they were in the spring of 2021.

Still, Biden’s economic advisers are increasingly telling the president in private that they feel optimistic about the direction things are headed. Historic-high prices that plagued the first few years of the Biden administration continue to moderate, all while economic growth is outpacing expectations. Advisers are also reminding the president that with each passing day, the unique trauma of the Covid-19 pandemic is getting smaller and smaller in the rearview mirror for many Americans.

If those trend lines continue, they have cautiously told Biden, consumer sentiment, too, should begin to course-correct.

But one senior adviser to the president told CNN the one thing they have not offered Biden is a prediction for when the American public’s psychology about the economy will have meaningfully improved. “I would never tell the president, ‘Sir, by March 17, we’ll know,’” that adviser said. “I would never say that. No one should, and he wouldn’t believe it if I did.”

Still, White House officials have been encouraged by early indications suggesting the public sentiment on the economy is starting to shift.

A survey from the University of Michigan released Friday showed consumer outlook soar 13% in January, reaching the highest level since the summer of 2021. Several days before that, consumer confidence as measured by the Conference Board jumped to a two-year high. Meanwhile, a recent CNN poll conducted by SSRS indicated pessimism about the economy could be easing, with 26% of Americans saying they feel the economy is starting to recover from problems of the past few years – up from 20% last summer.

But the president confronts a steep uphill battle on the economic front as his reelection campaign prepares for what it expects will be a rematch against former President Donald Trump in November.

A majority of Americans – 55% – said in the recent CNN poll that they believe Biden’s policies have worsened economic conditions in the country, while just 26% believe his policies have improved conditions. The president’s approval rating for handling the economy hasn’t broken the 40% mark since December 2021, and it currently stands at 37%.

While Biden and his advisers hope the economic trend lines will continue in the right direction, aides also acknowledge they have their work cut out for them on convincing voters that Biden’s domestic policies have helped fuel the economic recovery. That also doesn’t factor in the possibility of unforeseen economic obstacles, including those created by geopolitical conflicts.

There is also a delicate balancing act for the president to execute: Touting economic progress while being publicly sympathetic to the reality that many Americans still feel burdened by high prices, including on rent, housing and food.

To that end, Biden has started testing out lines that point the finger at some corporations that he says are taking advantage of the fact that prices were at record highs for so long.

Speaking in Columbia, South Carolina, last weekend, Biden noted the cost of everything from eggs to milk to gas have recently fallen.

“But for all we’ve done to bring prices down, there are still too many corporations in America ripping people off. Price gouging, junk feeds, greedflation, shrinkflation,” Biden added. “America – we’re tired of being played for suckers!”

The sentiment is being pushed by other Democrats, too – Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania recently released a series of reports examining both “greedflation” and “shrinkflation” – terms that refer to companies raising prices on goods at a faster clip than inflation and reducing product sizes without simultaneously lowering prices.

And as Biden addressed culinary union workers at a hotel cafeteria in Las Vegas on Monday morning, he pointed to a classic American candy bar to gripe about shrinkflation. A recent New York Times op-ed by the chief economist of UBS Global Wealth Management that used the price of Snickers bars to examine why so many Americans are still unhappy – despite falling inflation – had caught the president’s eye.

“They haven’t raised the price of a Snickers bar. They just took 10% of it out,” Biden said. “No, no, it’s much smaller. So that’s how they make more money.”","(3, 'inflation')"

United States President Joe Biden has hailed the US economy as the “envy of the world” as he seeks to assuage voters’ doubts about his economic stewardship in an election year.

In a fiery State of the Union address on Thursday, Biden pointed to a series of economic data points, including record job creation and rock-bottom unemployment, to make the case that the economy has gone from strength to strength on his watch.

“I inherited an economy that was on the brink. Now our economy is the envy of the world!” Biden told the joint session of the House of Representatives and the Senate.

“Fifteen million new jobs in just three years – that’s a record! Unemployment at 50-year lows. A record 16 million Americans are starting small businesses and each one is an act of hope.”

While there is room to quibble with some of Biden’s figures – the record creation data is skewed by the fact that there were so many job losses during the COVID-19 pandemic – the president’s overall argument is on solid ground.

By most accounts, the US economy is in an extremely strong position.

Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 3.1 percent last year – far ahead of other advanced economies. That performance is all the more remarkable considering that economists widely predicted a recession in 2023.

Inflation, a persistent thorn in the side of US consumers both during and after the pandemic, is now below 3 percent.

The problem for Biden, who is facing Republican challenger Donald Trump in November, is that voters are giving him little credit for these undeniably impressive numbers.

Poll after poll has shown that Americans don’t feel especially optimistic about the economy.

In a New York Times-Siena Poll published earlier this week, 51 percent of respondents rated the economy as “poor,” while 23 percent said it was “only fair.”

Only 26 percent rated it as “good” or “excellent.”

Even worse for Biden, voters rate Trump as more trustworthy in handling economic matters.

In an NBC News poll published last month, 55 percent of respondents said Trump would do a better job on the economy, compared with 33 percent who chose Biden.

Another poll by CBS News showed that 65 percent of Americans recalled Trump’s economy being good, compared with 38 percent who gave the current economy a positive assessment.

Biden will be keenly aware that US presidential elections are often won and lost on the economy (“It’s the economy, stupid” continues to be a popular slogan to describe voters’ priorities more than 30 years after it was uttered during Bill Clinton’s 1992 election campaign).

Given perceptions of the economy, it is perhaps not surprising that Trump is leading Biden in most polls.

In his State of the Union address, Biden devoted much of his time promoting the message that the economy should be fair and benefit all Americans.

“America’s comeback is building a future of American possibilities, building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down, investing in all of America, in all Americans to make sure everyone has a fair shot and we leave no one behind!” Biden, who proposed hiking taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals, said.

With a little under eight months until Americans vote, Biden has some time to turn around perceptions.

If he can’t, he will struggle to secure a second term.","(0, 'GDP')"

Growth is up, jobs numbers are strong, and inflation is at a three-year low. “Overall, it's been doing really well. The GDP has been growing. We didn't have the recession that a lot of us have been anticipating,” says Selcuk Eren, a senior economist at The Conference Board, a research group. “Unemployment has been under 4% for, I believe, 23 months in a row now. That is the new record.” Despite those robust numbers, most Americans, 68%, say the economy is worsening, according to a December 2023 Gallup poll, which showed that four in five U.S. adults rate the country’s current economic conditions as “poor” (45%) or “fair” (33%). Only 19% of people polled said the economy is “good,” in keeping with the positive economic markers. “Sometimes, real people don't think about that. They just think about how much they're spending out of their pockets, on the groceries, on the rent. … I think that's one reason we don't see the positive impact of the economy in the surveys that we are looking at,” Eren says. “Inflation is really, really miserable for everyone, and it impacts everybody at the same time.”

A January 2024 poll found that 90% of Republicans, 74% of independents, and 49% of Democrats, agree that the economy is in bad shape. The same poll found that just 31% of people approve of Biden's handling of the economy, while 56% disapprove. However, Justin Wolfers, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan, questions the accuracy of polls and says people’s actions suggest they believe the economy is doing well. “How would we figure out if the American consumer were in fact optimistic? I think the first thing you do is you look at consumption spending, because if you expect the economy to be terrible, you’d squirrel away money for this coming recession,” Wolfers said. “But instead, people have been spending money as if they believe, not only is the economy good, it’s going to continue to be good.” It’s also possible that people’s political preferences impact how they answer questions about the economy. “There's something internally incoherent about the polling that we're seeing where people are essentially allowing their feelings about the president to essentially govern their feelings about the economy,” said Greg Ip, chief economics commentator at The Wall Street Journal.

Ip and Wolfer spoke at a recent online symposium organized by the Brookings Institution and moderated by Sara Eisen, an anchor on cable business news channel CNBC. “When I talk to people — big investors, CEOs — they don't give Biden huge credit for the economy,” Eisen said. “They say it's happening despite him because his policies are all liberal, and he wants to raise taxes, and he wants to raise corporate taxes, and he wants to get rid of oil producers in this country, and all these things that are bad for the economy.” But Selcuk says Biden, as well as his immediate predecessor, Donald Trump, enacted policies that helped the economy. Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 aimed to curb inflation by reducing the federal government budget deficit. Other moves that kept the economy growing, despite massive layoffs during the COVID-19 pandemic, include extended unemployment benefit payments, one-time tax credits and direct payments to American households. “We were able to recover very fast from these huge job losses during the pandemic,” he says. “If there was no government intervention, we could have had those jobs not be recovered that quickly, and the unemployment rate could have been really high for a long time. So, definitely there’s lots of positives. Some of them started in the previous administration and continued until now.”","(0, 'GDP')"

Story Highlights 37% approve, 59% disapprove of Biden, unchanged from last month’s ratings

32% approve of Biden’s handling of foreign affairs, economy, Middle East conflict

Democrats’ ratings of Biden worst for the Middle East conflict

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- President Joe Biden’s job approval rating remains at 37%, tying his personal low, with disapproval at 59%. Approval ratings of the president’s handling of healthcare (40%) and the situation in Ukraine (38%) are similar to his overall rating, while fewer, 32% each, approve of his handling of the economy, foreign affairs, and the situation between the Israelis and Palestinians.

###Embeddable###

Gallup’s Nov. 1-21 poll marks the third time Biden’s overall job approval rating has been at 37%. All three instances have occurred in 2023 -- the first in April and the second in October. Biden’s job rating has not risen above 44% since August 2022 and has averaged 40% this year.

###Embeddable###

Gallup has measured Biden’s ratings on the economy and foreign affairs 10 times since he took office in 2021, and his ratings on the two issues have followed similar trajectories. Yet, in 2022, when inflation was at a 40-year high, and earlier this year, Biden’s foreign affairs ratings were significantly better than his economic ratings.

Biden’s current rating on the economy is just one percentage point higher than his lowest in 2022, while his foreign affairs rating is the lowest by six points.

###Embeddable###

Biden continues to navigate the United States’ role in wars between the Israelis and Palestinians and Russia and Ukraine, and he garners weak ratings for his handling of each. Americans’ current rating of the president’s handling of the situation in Ukraine is the lowest of four taken by Gallup and is down nine points since August.

The latest poll marks the first time Gallup has asked about Biden’s handling of the situation in the Middle East that erupted when Hamas militants invaded Israel on Oct. 7.

Democrats’ Ratings of Biden Worst on Middle East Conflict

While majorities of Democrats approve of Biden’s overall job performance and his handling of all five issues, their approval is lowest for the situation between the Israelis and Palestinians. In all, 60% of Democrats approve of his handling of the conflict, reflecting intraparty tensions over Israel’s right to defend itself against Hamas versus prioritizing the safety of Palestinian civilians. A separate question in the poll finds that 36% of Democrats approve of Israel’s military action against Hamas.

Meanwhile, two-thirds of Democrats approve of Biden’s job on foreign affairs, and roughly three-quarters each approve of his handling of the economy, healthcare policy and the situation in Ukraine. At the same time, no more than 16% of Republicans or 35% of independents approve of Biden’s handling of any of the issues. Republicans are most approving of Biden’s handling of the Middle East situation, while independents give him his best marks on healthcare policy.

More than four in five Democrats, 83%, approve of Biden’s overall job performance, compared with 5% of Republicans and 27% of independents.

Biden Approval Recovers Among Democrats but Falters Among Independents

After dropping 11 points last month, Democrats’ latest approval rating of Biden has rebounded and is up eight points to 83%. Still, it falls short of the nearly unanimous approval Biden enjoyed from his party during the first 11 months of his presidency.

Meanwhile, Biden’s approval rating from political independents has dropped eight points over the past month to a record-low 27% for that group, while he continues to earn minimal approval, just 5%, from Republicans.

###Embeddable###

Bottom Line

With less than a year to go until the presidential election, Biden continues to receive tepid ratings from the American public. His overall job approval rating is still at his personal low and is in historically dangerous territory for an incumbent seeking reelection. In addition, political independents’ record-low rating of Biden is striking. Biden’s even weaker ratings on the economy, foreign affairs and the Middle East suggest that his performance in these areas is dragging down his overall job performance rating.

Just over two years ago, then-President-elect Biden addressed the nation in a prime time speech to propose his economic agenda: a plan for a strong, worker-centered economic recovery from the pandemic, followed by long-term investments to lay the foundation for more durable, resilient, and inclusive long-run growth.

In those remarks, the President made a series of concrete commitments to the American people about his plan for economic recovery and renewal. This blog post reviews those commitments and progress made in the two years since they were made.

The President refers to his economic strategy as bottom-up and middle-out economics. That strategy starts with the idea that we should prioritize economic policies that help workers and families recover from economic downturns, avoid the scarring that is too often associated with joblessness and other economic challenges, and provide lower-income and middle-class Americans more breathing room by lowering the costs they face.

Building from the bottom up and middle out also means investing in America – in infrastructure, innovation, and clean energy – in ways that rebuild our industrial strength and supply chains, and expand the productive capacity of the economy. This includes making historic, capacity enhancing investments in our physical infrastructure and our people. It means catalyzing and crowding in private investment in high-growth and high-potential industries, including those that are central to our national security, economic security, and climate and clean energy goals. These kinds of investments won’t just enhance productivity and grow the economy over time – but they can also facilitate more inclusive economic growth that improves living standards for workers and boosts a host of economic outcomes in communities that have long suffered from disinvestment.

Two years in, a review of these commitments underscores that President Biden’s economic strategy is working. Economies around the world including the United States have struggled with pandemic-driven price increases. But we have made important progress in bringing inflation down while maintaining a resilient recovery. In fact, the United States is better-positioned than other major economies to navigate the transition to steady, stable growth with lower inflation and without giving up all the economic gains we have achieved over the last two years. While there is more work to do, and we may face setbacks along the way, the policy strategy we have executed positions us uniquely well to come out of the pandemic crisis stronger, more resilient, and prosperous for years and decades to come.

Take bold action to get American workers back into jobs

“Some 18 million Americans are still relying on unemployment insurance…And it’s not hard to see that we’re in the middle of the once in several generations economic crisis with a once in several generations public health crisis. The crisis of deep human suffering is in plain sight and there’s no time to waste. We have to act and we have to act now.”

The President-elect began his speech on January 14, 2021 by emphasizing the urgency of bold action to get American workers back into jobs.

Since then, the economy has recovered all of the jobs lost during the pandemic downturn and it did so faster than in the aftermath of the last three major economic downturns – the 1990 – 1991 and 2001 recessions, and the 2007 – 2009 Great Recession.

2021 and 2022 – President Biden’s first two years in office – were the strongest years of job creation on record. Similarly, the share of prime working age Americans in jobs or looking for work is higher now than it was in almost the entire decade before the pandemic began – and has recovered more of the lost ground than at this time in the last two downturns.

Moreover, the unemployment rate fell to a 50-year low at the end of 2022, with the unemployment rate near record lows for African-Americans and Hispanics and at the lowest rate in history for people with disabilities. In the context of this uniquely strong labor market, wages have gone up the most for lower- and middle income workers.

This progress was far from pre-ordained – it was driven by decisive policy action to get Americans back to work. Before the passage of the American Rescue Plan, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that the unemployment rate would be 4.9% in the final quarter of 2022, rather than the 3.5% it actually reached.

The policy priority on driving a strong labor market recovery was grounded in decades of economic research showing that long spells of unemployment have severe and long-lasting “scarring” impacts on workers, families, and communities: long-term unemployment makes it harder to find future jobs or acquire new skills; it drives higher rates of depression and substance abuse; it puts financial distress on families; and it has devastating educational and economic effects on children. It is particularly noteworthy, in this context, that long term unemployment is down by more than 3 million people from its March 2021 peak, and is currently well below its 2010-2019 average.

Throughout this period, the Administration has also taken direct action – through the National Labor Relations Board and the President’s Task Force on Union Organizing and Worker Empowerment – to promote the strength of unions. In part as a result, petitions for union representation elections were up 53% in the private sector in 2022.

Accelerate the Federal Government’s response to end the COVID-19 pandemic

“Our rescue plan starts aggressively in order to speed up our national COVID-19 response.”

The President identified early on that economic recovery was inextricably tied to ending the COVID-19 pandemic’s grip on our economy and our lives. To safely put Americans back to work, we had to rapidly develop and deploy vaccines, increase testing access, and reopen our schools and businesses. He also recognized that pandemic conditions were highly uncertain, and we needed to prepare for risks were at the time unknown but ultimately materialized, like the Delta and Omicron variants.

Two years later, COVID deaths are down over 80%. Vaccines, treatments like Paxlovid, and testing are ubiquitously available; and our schools and businesses are open again. We are far better positioned to deal with surges and new variants than before.

All the while, the President has worked to limit the potential economic disruptions from the pandemic – shortages of essential products like medicine and food, shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) for front-line healthcare workers and the general public, and shortages and disruptions that arose across the economy due to global pandemic-oriented supply chain challenges.

The Administration, for example, brought business and labor together to broker an agreement to move ports to 24/7 operations, which has helped increase goods movement through the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach by 24% above pre-pandemic record levels, while bringing goods transportation prices down. The Administration launched a Trucking Action Plan to increase the supply of truck drivers in good jobs, which helped to double the number of new commercial driver’s licenses issued. The Administration also worked with Congress to pass the bipartisan Ocean Shipping Reform Act, lowering costs for consumers. As of December, a leading index of supply chain pressures showed that more than 70% of pandemic-oriented supply chain pressures had eased.

Help American households avoid the worst economic outcomes associated with downturns

“Our rescue plan also includes immediate relief to Americans, hardest hit, and most in need… It will also provide more peace of mind for struggling families… And as we work to keep people from going hungry, we’ll also work to keep a roof over their heads, to stem the growing housing crisis and evictions that are looming.”

Part of the logic behind bold action to spur a rapid labor market recovery and provide relief to households was the necessity of helping households avoid some of the most negative economic outcomes that are often associated with downturns – things like evictions and foreclosures, bankruptcies, and loss of health care coverage.

As shown below, financial security for households on a range of measures is not only better than it was during the depths of the pandemic, but, critically, measures of financial security have also generally improved compared to both pre-pandemic levels and averages from 2010-20191. Because of policies President Biden has signed into law, we have reduced health care costs and expanded access – leading to the lowest uninsured rate on record in 2022. In other words, because of focused and decisive policy action, households are coming out of the pandemic better off than before on key metrics of economic security – something that typically takes years to happen after economic downturns. And while inflation has undoubtedly posed challenges to economic security, wages increased faster than inflation in the second half of 2022 – as gas prices declined substantially, core inflation moderated, and the labor market remained strong – providing further tangible economic benefit to workers and families.

Give small business the support they need and spur renewed entrepreneurship

“Our rescue plan will also help small businesses that are the engines of our economic growth, our economy as a whole, the glue that holds communities together as well.”

The President knows that small businesses are engines of economic growth and employment in communities throughout the country. Over the last two years, the Biden-Harris Administration has provided billions of dollars in pandemic relief, investment, lending, and technical assistance to level the playing field and allow small businesses to thrive.

Beyond helping small businesses stay afloat, the Biden economic agenda has also helped drive an unprecedented surge in entrepreneurship. Just this week, new data show that over the last two years, Americans have applied to start 10.5 million new businesses, the strongest two years on record. In 2022, Americans applied to start 5 million new businesses, the second most on record only behind the 5.4 million applicants filed in 2021.

Each of these new small businesses is an act of optimism – people everywhere in the country are putting their own money and their own lives into something new, and they’re doing it in record numbers.

Jumpstart the economy while avoiding the long-term damage to debt and deficits

“It’s not just that smart fiscal investments, including deficit spending, are more urgent than ever, it’s that the return on these investments in jobs, racial equity, will prevent long-term economic damage and the benefits will far surpass the cost.”

The President-elect noted in his speech that the Rescue Plan he proposed wouldn’t just be good for our economy and workers, but it was also the smart thing to do from a fiscal standpoint: that by passing the Rescue Plan, we could jumpstart the economy and avoid the long-term damage to debt and deficits that are associated with slow recoveries, low tax receipts, and prolonged emergency spending.

In the last two years, in addition to the substantial economic benefits stemming from the historically strong recovery, we have also seen significant deficit reduction – as the Rescue Plan facilitated a strong economic recovery and enabled the responsible wind-down of emergency spending programs. Building on this fiscal progress, the President last year signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act, which makes historic progress on reducing energy and health care costs while reducing the deficit by more than $200 billion over the next decade.

Make long-overdue investments in America’s infrastructure

“It’s time to stop talking about infrastructure and to finally start building an infrastructure so we can be more competitive. Millions of good paying jobs that put Americans to work, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our ports, to make them more climate resilient, to make them faster, cheaper, cleaner to transport American made goods across our country and around the world. That’s how we compete.”

While policymakers for decades have called for investment to revitalize American infrastructure, President Biden worked to bring together Democrats and Republicans to pass the largest investment in infrastructure since we built the interstate highway system. Already, the Biden Administration has launched $185 billion in infrastructure projects, including funding for 6,900 projects, reaching over 4,000 communities across all 50 states, D.C., and the territories. From our roads and bridges to rail, public transit, and the first nationwide network of electrical vehicle chargers to universal high-speed internet, the Biden economic agenda is enabling the kinds of infrastructure investments that economists have long argued would boost economic capacity and crowd-in private investment.

Support for the future of clean energy, manufacturing, and innovation

“American manufacturing was the arsenal of democracy in World War II. It will be so again. Imagine a future made in America, all made in America and all by Americans. We’ll use taxpayers’ dollars to rebuild America. We’ll buy American products, supporting millions of American manufacturing jobs, enhancing our competitive strength in an increasingly competitive world.”

“Imagine historic investments in research and development to sharpen America’s innovative edge in markets where global leadership is up for grabs, markets like the battery technology, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, clean energy. Imagine confronting the climate crisis with American jobs and ingenuity leading the world.”

Building on the strongest two years of manufacturing job growth in 40 years, the President signed the most significant investment in manufacturing, science, innovation, and industrial strategy in over 50 years. And he then signed the largest public investment in the clean energy transition in U.S. history.

Already, private companies have invested nearly $300 billion in locating manufacturing in the United States – from the Rust Belt to the Southwest – ranging from semiconductors to lithium batteries to clean energy production to electric vehicle manufacturing. Many companies have cited incentives and investments signed into law by President Biden as key reasons for their investments. And critically, many of these investments are in communities that have experienced disinvestment in recent years or are geared towards workers without college degrees – whose labor force participation has mostly declined over the last two decades. In other words, these investments can help our economy thrive over the long-run by raising economic potential, promoting resilience, and limiting future harms associated with climate change.

Reform the tax code so the wealthy and large corporation pay their fair share

“As I said on the campaign trail, we will pay for [these investments] by making sure that everyone pays their fair share, not [by] punishing anybody… It’s the right thing for our economy. It’s the fair thing. It’s the decent thing to do.”

As President Biden came into office, he highlighted the need to reform the tax system so that high-income people and corporations pay their fair share. The 2017 tax law only made an unfair tax system worse, and decades of underfunding for tax enforcement meant that the wealthy and large corporations were able to evade their taxes, even as middle-class workers paid the taxes they owed.

Since then, President Biden has signed multiple revenue enhancing tax provisions that will allow us to raise hundreds of billions of dollars to fund critical national priorities that promote economic growth, while making our tax system more equitable.

One is an investment that will allow the U.S. government to crack down on wealthy tax cheats and improve taxpayer services. Working people pay 99% of the taxes they owe, while the top 1%hides about 20% of their income from tax, including by funneling it through offshore accounts in tax havens that don’t report earnings. The investment President Biden signed into law will reduce the deficit by more than $100 billion by cracking down on wealthy tax cheats. None of the resources will be used to increase audit rates relative to historical levels for small businesses or households with incomes below $400,000; in fact, middle-class taxpayers will see more timely refunds and other service improvements because of these resources.

Another is a 15 percent minimum tax on the corporate profits that large corporations—those with over $1 billion in profits—report to shareholders. This new corporate minimum tax increases taxes only on the large companies that are reporting high profits but paying little to no tax, leveling the playing field for companies that are already paying their fair share.

In addition to these legislative accomplishments, the Administration has made substantial strides in working towards a global minimum tax on corporations. The Administration’s leadership has been critical in working to end the global race to the bottom on corporate taxation, which places a higher tax burden on workers and deprives governments around the world – including the United States – of the ability to raise sufficient tax revenue to invest in economic growth.

When President-elect Biden addressed the nation two years ago, he said he believed that if Congress passed his agenda, we would “come out better off than when we went into the crisis.” Two years later, we can now say that we have done so.

The President’s economic plan has laid the foundation for a bottom-up and middle-out recovery – one of the strongest and most equitable economic recoveries in history. This historic recovery – and legislation the President has signed to address longstanding affordability challenges – has set the stage for a transition to steady, stable growth, with lower inflation, even as we keep our job market resilient. Going forward, we need to build on this progress – by lowering the cost of care to help more parents work; by investing in education and skills training, particularly for those without a college degree; and by investing in children and lowering child poverty in America.

Of course, we face a range of economic risks – from geopolitical uncertainty to the potential for reckless extremism around the full faith and credit of the United States. But two years in, because of the resilience of the American people and the economic policies we have pursued, we are better positioned than we have been in decades to achieve durable, resilient, and inclusive long-run growth that we too often failed to achieve before the crisis.","(0, 'GDP')"

But polling has consistently shown the economy to be a weak spot for Biden’s reelection hopes. Just 33% approve of his leadership on the issue, according to a May survey by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs.

For much of his presidency, Biden has blamed high gasoline prices, painfully rising food costs and other cost-of-living expenses on the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. He said those two factors were beyond his control as inflation hit a 40-year high last summer and crushed the his approval ratings.

In a Chicago speech on Wednesday, Biden will begin a new effort to actively convince a worried public that the U.S. economy is not heading for recession but actually thriving because of his leadership. For him, there’s a happy confluence of the coming 2024 reelection campaign and a favorable turn in recent economic data, leading the White House to believe that public messaging about “Bidenomics” will help to rally Democratic voters going into next year.

The message is not a new one, though the White House believes it bears repeating so that it soaks in. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at Monday’s news briefing that the president’s upcoming remarks would be a “cornerstone” speech and part of a larger administration-wide effort.

“It’s a vision about growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up — you hear us say that over and over again, because we believe that trickle-down economics does not work,” Jean-Pierre said. “We have the data to prove it.”

Indeed, the rate of inflation has fallen over the past year while the job market has remained solid, a combination that seemed unlikely to many economic analysts who expected efforts to bring down inflation would cause layoffs and a recession. Goldman Sachs has put the odds of a recession in the next 12 months at 25%, down from its previous estimate of 35%.

Consumer prices rose at an annual pace of 4% in May, down from 9.1% last June. That’s still higher than the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, indicating that inflation remains a challenge. But employers added a robust 339,000 jobs last month in a sign that the economy appears poised to keep growing. And the inflation-adjusted annual increase in what people earn each hour turned positive in May, one of the main indicators that White House officials had been looking at for proof the economy was helping workers.

Biden’s GOP rivals have said that the president has broken the U.S. economy. They’ve tip-toed around the healthy 3.7% unemployment rate and focused instead on prices at the gas pump, grocery bills, the debt tied to Biden’s $1.9 trillion in pandemic relief and the administration’s focus on shifting away from fossil fuels in order to combat climate change.

“I will stop Joe Biden’s inflation nightmare, save the U.S. economy,” said former President Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner, in a speech to evangelical Christians last weekend.

“You would think that with these economic problems with inflation, you may want to tap into more domestic energy,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in an Iowa speech. “But no, Biden is deliberately trying to kneecap our energy production and he’s trying to force Americans into electric vehicles, which will make us more reliant on China, who provides most of the materials for the batteries.”

Part of Biden’s challenge is that confidence in his economic leadership has waned. In March 2021 just after his round of pandemic relief became law, 60% of U.S. adults approved of how the president was handling the economy, according to an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs poll. Since then, that figure has essentially halved.

Still, there are signs that people’s views of the economy are improving. The University of Michigan’s survey of consumer sentiment showed that Democrats, Republicans and unaffiliated voters generally feel better about the current state of the economy than they did a year ago. But confidence among Democrats is still weaker than it was during Biden’s first year.

The administration released a memo ahead of Biden’s Wednesday speech that made the point that his policy ideas are broadly supported in polls, leaving unsaid that those proposals generally fare better than the president himself does.

Biden aides see ‘Bidenomics’ as an expansive framing to a host of the president’s policies for easy public consumption, tying together a diverse set of initiatives meant to boost the nation’s global competitiveness with programs meant to strengthen the middle class at home.

The president is betting that targeted government investments can catapult the economy forward and help workers. During his first two years when Democrats controlled the House, Biden followed up on his pandemic relief by pushing through a bipartisan infrastructure building bill, funding for computer chip plants and tax breaks to encourage the use of renewable energy.

This approach goes back to Biden’s own blue collar identity that surfaces in his speeches: the Scranton, Pennsylvania kid whose family at times just eked by financially.

But it can take several years to replace bridges and tunnels, to build new factories, to lay broadband cable for the internet and to make drivers comfortable with buying electric vehicles. Administration officials have privately acknowledged that there is a lag between the economy that the president is promising and what voters will likely see by the 2024 elections.

Biden in remarks in July 2021 had initially dismissed higher inflation as “transitory,” saying he was confident that the bout coming out of the pandemic was temporary. Those remarks became a point of attack among Republican lawmakers and some economists as inflation worsened after his statement.

Yet Biden has stressed that he provides an alternative to GOP policies that try to boost the economy mostly through tax cuts. He said Monday in announcing more than $40 billion to ensure high-speed internet for the entire country that his ideas are similar to the New Deal-era playbook used to combat the Great Depression nearly a century ago.

“What we are doing, as I said, is not unlike what Franklin Delano Roosevelt did when he brought electricity to nearly every American home and farm,” Biden said.

The question is whether voters think that Biden can deliver just as FDR did and whether elections work the same as they did back in 1936, when the Rural Electrification Act became law. Later that November, Roosevelt won more than 60% of the popular vote as he won a second term.

In today’s polarized era, Biden is unlikely to secure anywhere near that margin. But his message on Wednesday will likely be that his presidency has already begun to reshape the world’s largest economy for the better and voters should judge him on that record.

He previewed the takeaway he wants voters to hear at a fundraiser last week in California, even as polls indicate that much of the public still feels pessimistic about the direction of the U.S.

“We unleashed, I think,” he said, “a sense of expectation in America that we can do anything.”

Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology. Here are the questions used for the report and its methodology.

With public views of the nation’s economy at their most negative in years, Joe Biden’s political standing is at the lowest point of his presidency. Yet Biden is hardly the only focal point of the country’s political discontent: Americans express unfavorable views of both major parties and a range of leading political figures, including Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump.

Biden’s current job approval numbers are the lowest since he became president, with 37% of U.S. adults saying they approve of how he is handling his job as president while 62% disapprove. Biden’s job rating has declined 6 percentage points since March (43%) and 18 points over the past year; last July, a 55% majority approved of Biden’s job performance.

Amid persistent inflation, the public’s views of the national economy have worsened since the start of this year. Today, just 13% of adults say economic conditions in the United States are excellent or good; 28% said this six months ago.

A majority of Americans say Biden’s policies have hurt the economy: 56% now say his policies have made economic conditions worse, compared with just 11% who say his policies have improved the economy. About a third (32%) say they have not had much of an effect. The share of Americans who say Biden’s policies have made economic conditions worse has increased 16 percentage points since last September.

Views of the economy – and the impact of the president’s policies on economic conditions – have long been deeply divided along partisan lines. Still, only 20% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say Biden’s policies have made the economy better, while 52% say they have had little impact and 27% say they have made things worse. Among Republicans and Republican leaners, 90% say Biden’s policies have made the economy worse.

A new Pew Research Center survey of 6,174 U.S. adults, conducted June 27 to July 4, finds that just 20% of Democrats and 5% of Republicans rate the nation’s economic conditions as excellent or good. These opinions have declined substantially since January, when 36% of Democrats and 20% of Republicans viewed the economy positively. Currently, Republicans are far more likely than Democrats to rate conditions as poor (67% vs. 32%); Democrats are more likely to say they are “only fair” (47% vs. 28%).

The public’s economic concerns are dominated by worries over rising prices. Three-quarters of Americans say they are very concerned about rising prices for food and consumer goods; an identical share say they are very concerned about rising prices for gasoline and energy. Majorities in almost every demographic group say they are very worried about rising prices for food and energy.

Among five other issues asked about, the cost of housing is the next most concerning for the public, with six-in-ten saying they are very concerned about this. About four-in-ten (42%) are very concerned about limited availability for some consumer products. Fewer Americans say they are very concerned about employers finding workers to hire (32%), the performance of the stock market (31%) or people being unable to find jobs (27%).

When asked to assess possible causes for inflation, nearly half of adults (49%) say “businesses taking advantage of economic conditions to increase their profits” has contributed a lot to rising prices. Nearly as many (45%) cite the impact of COVID-19 on manufacturing and shipping.

Fewer say that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (39%), government aid to deal with the economic impact of the pandemic (32%), or the fact that interest rates were very low until recently (25%) have contributed a lot to rising prices.

Democrats are much more likely than Republicans to say Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and businesses taking advantage of conditions to increase profits are major factors driving inflation. Republicans, by contrast, are more likely to point to the government’s aid to deal with economic impact of the pandemic.

Other important findings from the survey

Both parties continue to be viewed unfavorably. With less than four months until the midterm elections, neither party is very popular with the public. Slightly more Americans say they view the Democratic Party (41%) favorably than say so about the Republican Party (37%), but clear majorities view both parties unfavorably (61% for the GOP and 57% for the Democrats).

Biden, Trump, congressional leaders viewed more negatively than positively. The public’s views of eight political leaders included on the survey – including Biden and Trump – are all unfavorable overall. The public gives Biden (43% favorable vs. 55% unfavorable) slightly better ratings than Trump (38% vs. 60%). Congressional leaders fare the worst, with Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi each viewed unfavorably by about six-in-ten Americans (62% McConnell and 60% Pelosi). Views of Vice President Kamala Harris and former Vice President Mike Pence are somewhat more positive, yet both are still underwater in their personal favorability ratings.

Biden is viewed negatively – but better than Trump – on some dimensions. Evaluations of Biden’s performance in specific areas are largely negative – as they were for Trump at a similar point in his presidency – but Biden outperforms Trump on setting “a high moral standard for the presidency” (43% say Biden has definitely or probably done this, compared with 27% who said it about Trump in August 2018) and running “an open and transparent administration” (44% say this about Biden today vs. 37% about Trump four years ago). However, more said Trump improved the way government worked (37% in 2018) than say this about Biden today (29%).

More agree with the GOP than with Democrats on economic policy, but Democrats have edge on most issues. Americans are more likely to say they agree with the Democratic Party than the Republican Party on a number of key issues – including policies on health care, race, COVID-19 and climate change as well as policies affecting LGBT people.

However, the Republican Party holds a 7 percentage point advantage on the economy: 40% Americans say they agree with the GOP on economic policy, compared with a third who say they agree with the Democratic Party.

With abortion policy in the spotlight following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, 43% say they agree with the Democrats on abortion policy, while 29% say that about Republicans; another 26% say they agree with neither party on abortion policy.","(3, 'inflation')"

Here's why

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images Mario Tama/Getty Images

The economy's good. The economy's bad.

It depends on who you ask — and increasingly which party is in the White House when you ask.

It was yet another strong jobs report Friday, exceeding expectations. Almost 200,000 jobs were created last month and unemployment dropped to 3.7%, which is near full employment.

People are also spending at a record rate this holiday shopping season — 200 million people shopped between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, higher than expectations and the most ever.

They spent a record $38 billion on holiday items during that short stretch, up 8% from a year ago.

And they're expected to spend nearly $1 trillion holiday shopping this year, according to the National Retail Federation.

Despite all that, pessimism about the economy reigns.

Both Gallup and the Pew Research Center found just 1 in 5 rated the economy as either excellent or good.

Inflation, which has led to higher grocery and gas bills than Americans would like, is partially to blame for souring their moods. But there's more going on here.

There is a huge divide by party on the question of the economy, and there's a stark switch that's been taking place when there's a new administration. And this party-line view of the economy is particularly noticeable among Republicans.

For example, according to Pew, in 2016 when former President Obama, a Democrat, was in office, just 18% of Republicans thought the economy was either good or excellent.

But in 2020, with Trump, a Republican, in office, that jumped to a whopping 81%. And this year, with Biden in the White House, Republicans' positive views of the economy tanked to just 10%.

Sure, inflation went up, but economics alone doesn't cause that kind of whiplash.

Consider: During Obama's tenure, the economy was still recovering from the Great Recession, but unemployment by the time Obama left office was at 4.7%. By February 2020, just before the pandemic hit, unemployment dropped to 3.5%, a decline to be sure, but not to the extreme that would explain Republicans' 63-point increase under Trump when inflation was flat.

Democrats were more optimistic about the economy during the recent Democratic presidencies, but not to the extent of Republicans' wild swings.

In 2016, 46% of Democrats had a more positive than negative view of the economy, according to Pew. In 2020 under Trump, Democrats grew more pessimistic, but only by 7 points.

In 2023, they declined further to 28% — still 18 points higher than Republicans, but nowhere near as bullish as Republicans were under Trump.

But the pessimism can't be dismissed as simply politics

While Republicans have had sharper changes in economic outlook and a lot of that may be politics, the fact that Democrats have also declined in their views of the economy does show that it's not all about politics.

The fact is inflation is one of those things people can see — they see it on massive signs at gas stations and on their grocery bills. Overall inflation after the pandemic began to rise and hit a high of 9.1% in June of last year. But food inflation was an even higher 11.4% last summer.

That meant that things like steak, bacon, eggs, cheese, potato chips, coffee, ice cream and cookies were more expensive. All are household items and noticeable every time someone checks out at the store.

Overall inflation and food inflation have both come down significantly since the start of the year, from 6.4% overall to 3.2% in October and from 10.1% to 3.3% for food.

There's been an especially sharp decline in food inflation since the summer, but that hasn't necessarily meant prices have come down much, if at all, and Biden isn't seeing any political benefit — 67% disapproved of Biden's handling of the economy in the latest Gallup survey, which is similar to other recent polls' findings.

Housing costs in many parts of the country remain high, and one of the reasons for inflation coming down is because the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates substantially, making the ability to afford a home significantly more difficult.

The economy, but more specifically how much stuff costs, is always going to be top of mind for voters. And there's no easy solution politically.

Biden and his campaign team have to hope that inflation continues to recede, the Fed starts to lower rates, and people feel a loosening of the pinch on their wallets in an election year, because right now this issue makes Biden especially vulnerable for reelection.

Only 36% of U.S. adults approve of Biden’s handling of the economy, slightly lower than the 42% who approve of his overall performance, according to the new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Both figures are close to where Biden’s approval numbers have stood for about the past year and a half, including just two months ago. Signs of an improving economic outlook have done little to sway how people feel about the Democratic president as he gears up for a 2024 reelection campaign that could pit him against his predecessor and 2020 opponent, Republican Donald Trump.

Job growth has stayed solid with the unemployment rate at 3.5%, while the pace of inflation has slowed sharply over the past year to the annual rate of 3.2%.

Both Biden and Trump have weaknesses as older candidates seeking a rematch. Trump, 77, faces a series of criminal indictments that include his possession of classified material and allegations that he tried to overturn the 2020 election, which has rallied support among Republicans while leaving him with substantial vulnerabilities in a potential general election contest.

Biden, 80, has yet to fully bring Democrats to his side as the lingering aftershocks of inflation still weigh on people’s minds. Along with members of his cabinet and Vice President Kamala Harris, Biden has been speaking about the $500 billion worth of new investments by private companies that he said came from incentives he signed into law.

Erica Basile, a teacher who describes herself as a “staunch Democrat,” said she feels the economy is “mediocre, but improving.”

“I do think in many ways they’re working very hard at getting the economy back on track post-COVID,” said Basile, who lives in Lynnwood, Washington.

Just 65% of Democrats approve of Biden’s economic leadership, while 76% approve of how he’s handling the job overall.

In follow-up interviews, some survey respondents felt torn between the desire to return to a sense of normalcy after Trump’s presidency and the desire for even more sweeping policies to address climate change, health care costs and taxes.

“When Joe Biden was selected to be the nominee and eventually won, my feeling at the time was that he could be the most milquetoast and undramatic president to help the country cool down,” said Steven Peters, 41, who works in information technology in White House, Tennessee. “Unfortunately, that’s what he’s been. I’m dissatisfied because I had hoped there would be more change.”

Peters added, “He’s really middle of the road when a lot of people would like to see more dramatic action.”

For GOP supporters, such as Merritt Rahn, 74, Biden has gone too far. Rahn said he is retired but also works at Home Depot and sees higher gasoline and food costs as making it harder for families to get by financially. The Jensen Beach, Florida, resident said Biden will further hurt the U.S. by moving energy sources away from oil and gas.

“It’s a death to our society and economy,” said Rahn, who added that he believes Biden “has no clue what’s going on.”

The poll also found that 55% of Democrats say they don’t think Biden should run again in 2024, though a large majority — 82% — say they would definitely or probably support him if he is the nominee. Overall, only 24% of Americans say they want Biden to run again.

Among Democrats who approve of how Biden is handling the economy, 58% would like him to seek another term. Just 20% of those who disapprove of his performance on the issue want the incumbent president to run again.

Biden continues to struggle to appeal to younger Democrats, especially on the economy. Only 52% of Democrats under age 45 say they approve of his handling of the economy, compared with 77% of those older.

The president has used the term “Bidenomics” to try to encompass his ideas to lower costs for people on Medicare, shift toward electric vehicles and renewable energy, and build factories for advanced computer chips and batteries. Yet some are still struggling to understand what the term means.

Asked about the definition of Bidenomics, Cory O’Brien, 39, said: “You know what, dude, I have no idea. Biden is a free market capitalist like most moderate Democrats are.”

The age gap extends to Biden’s reelection campaign: Just 34% of Democrats under 45 want him to run again, compared with 54% of those older than that. Still, about three-quarters of younger Democrats say they’ll most likely support him if he’s the nominee, though only 28% say they definitely will.

O’Brien, who works in education and lives in Massachusetts, said he expects the 2024 election to be “miserable” for voters because of the likely Biden and Trump rematch.

“I think it’s going to be a miserable election cycle,” he said. “We’re going to see a lot of the same stuff that we saw in 2020.”

Biden also faces renewed pressure related to investigations over his son Hunter’s business dealings. The poll finds that a majority of Americans — 58% — have hardly any confidence in Biden to reduce corruption in government, though that’s unchanged since January. Another 30% have some confidence and 10% have have a great deal of confidence.

The poll shows that 23% of Americans say they have a great deal of confidence in Biden’s ability to effectively manage the White House, 31% have some confidence and 45% have hardly any. Despite the fact that Biden has achieved several of his major policy goals, just 16% say they have high confidence in his ability to do that, while 38% say they have some confidence and 44% hardly any.

Few Americans say they think the national economy is doing well: 34% describe it as very or somewhat good. No more than about a third of Americans have called the economy good since 2021.

President Joe Biden defended his handling of the economy hours after a key economic report found that progress on slowing inflation has stalled, a continued bane on Biden’s presidency.

US consumer prices picked up again last month, marking a 3.5% increase for the 12 months ended in March, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Inflation has dogged the president and his approval ratings on the economy have suffered as prices have soared following the easing of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Biden pointed to success “dramatically” reducing the rate of inflation from 9% to 3% as he sought to convince Americans that “we’re better situated than we were when we took office, where inflation was skyrocketing.”

Inflation, however, began to rise in 2021 – Biden’s first year as president – as normalcy began to return to American life following the worst parts of the pandemic. It peaked in June 2022 as the rate of inflation reached 9.1%.

According to a CNN poll from earlier this year, a 55% majority of Americans overall say they feel Biden’s policies have worsened economic conditions in the country, while just 26% believe his policies have improved conditions. Another 19% say they’ve had no effect – numbers that are nearly unchanged from the summer.

A near-universal 91% of Republicans say that Biden’s policies have worsened the economy, while a more modest 55% majority of Democrats say that his policies have improved things. Biden’s approval rating for handling the economy, which hasn’t broken the 40% mark since December 2021, currently stands at 37% among the full public.

Republicans, Biden said, have “no plan.”

“We have a plan to deal with it whereas the opposition – my opposition – talks about two things. They just want to cut taxes for the wealthy and raise taxes on other people. And so I think they have no plan. Our plan is one, I think, is so sustainable,” he told reporters in the Rose Garden.

Wednesday’s report further highlights that the path to lower inflation remains extremely bumpy — and continue to be a drag on Americans’ finances — and that any loosening of monetary policy might not happen soon.

The president stood by his prediction that there will be a cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, and that could happen “before the year is out,” though he cautioned that it could be delayed.

“We don’t know what the Fed is going to do for certain,” he reiterated.

US stocks tanked Wednesday after the release of the hotter-than-expected inflation data, with the blue-chip Dow falling by more than 500 points. The S&P 500 lost 1% and the Nasdaq Composite fell by 1%.

President Joe Biden is leaning into the political branding ""Bidenomics"" as his 2024 reelection effort kicks into high gear.

He and top advisers renewed their push to keep improving economic news and his overall sprawling vision in the public eye with a stop Thursday in the swing state of South Carolina as part of an ""Investing in America"" tour.

There, he announced clean energy investments that will create 1,800 jobs nationwide.

""Our plan is working,"" Biden said. ""And one of the things I'm proudest of is it's working everywhere.""

The fresh messaging comes as the administration has been buoyed by positive numbers on inflation, unemployment and more.

The state of the economy and how it affects Americans personally is traditionally a key -- if not the most important -- issue for voters. But their perceptions can lag behind the numbers and many remain unconvinced Biden has done a good job handling the economy, polls show, while Republicans are hitting him on it at every turn on the campaign trail.

""There's been this unprecedented gap between what the data shows us is going on in the economy and what people think is going on in the economy,"" Heidi Shierholz, president of the nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute, told ABC News.

Improving economic picture

Inflation has dropped for 11 straight months, from its peak of 9.1% in June of last year to 4.0% in May. Unemployment stands at 3.7%, which is a near 50-year low, and 13 million jobs have been added since Biden took office.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell last week praised the resiliency of the U.S. economy, and said while a recession is still possible it's not the most likely case.

""Over the last year, things have turned out a lot better than a lot of economists thought it would,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, told ABC News.

The White House, in addition to touting the above economic indicators, is pushing three major pieces of legislation passed under Biden they say will reinvigorate America’s economy over the next decade: the Chips and Science Act, Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

A new report from the Treasury Department highlighted manufacturing construction spending has doubled since the end of 2021 and the passage of the bills.

""For the first time in a long time, there's enthusiasm about building high-tech factories in the United States,"" said Brad Setser, a former trade and Treasury official in the Biden and Obama administrations.

Despite the progress, Biden remains underwater with voters when it comes to the economy. One recent poll from ABC News and the Washington Post found Americans 54-36% said former President Donald Trump did a better job handling the economy when he was in office than Biden's done so far.

Why voters remain unconvinced

One major reason why voters may not be giving Biden credit, economists said, is that inflation is still uncomfortably high and wages have only just started to keep up with price hikes. Powell said last week the target inflation rate of 2% is not expected to be reached until 2025, and more interest rate hikes could be in store to bring that data point down.

""It's painfully high,"" Zandi said of inflation. ""It's moderating but still people are having to shell out more of their income to maintain their purchasing power.""

Political observers also noted bad economic news, such as when gas prices rose to over $5 a gallon or inflation reached a 40-year high, is often more salient in the news and to voters than good economic news.

Republicans have been united in bashing Biden on that front, accusing him of stoking inflation with large spending packages and hurting companies through ""woke"" policies.

So far, Democrats have produced a weaker counterpunch, said Dean Baker, the co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.

""The Democrats have been much less effective in focusing on a message and getting everyone to repeat it,"" Baker told ABC News. ""For better or worse, Republicans largely do that. So I think Biden has an uphill battle, but I think he does have a very good story to sell.""

Is the 'Bidenomics' pitch a gamble?

Biden will continue to talk economy on Friday when he announces new actions to lower health care costs and fight junk fees.

The messaging push, however, isn't without risk.

One of the most important questions moving forward, according to political scientist John Sides, is whether inflation continues to cool and real wages grow without economic contraction.

""If those economic trends continue, I would expect news coverage of the economy to become more positive and I would expect consumer confidence to increase,"" Sides told ABC News. ""I would expect Biden's approval rating to rise as well. That would make his reelection more likely, even if his approval rating isn't 'high' in absolute terms. It would also become more difficult for his opponent to center a campaign on economic fundamentals.""

But should the economy worsen, Sides said Biden should ""certainly focus on a different issue.""

""The moment to make that decision would be in the first few months of 2024,"" Sides said. ""Election-year trends in the economy are the most important to voters, so what happens in 2024 will be crucial for Biden's strategy and his reelection prospects.""","(3, 'inflation')"

The US has roared back from the Covid recession by official measures. But two-thirds of Americans are unhappy about the economy despite consistent reports that inflation is easing and unemployment is close to a 50-year low. And the poll suggests many are unaware of or don’t believe the positive economic news the government has reported.

The results illustrate a dramatic political split on economic views – with Republicans far more pessimistic than Democrats. But unhappiness about the economy is widespread.

Two-thirds of respondents (68%) reported it’s difficult to be happy about positive economic news when they feel financially squeezed each month (Republicans: 69%, Democrats: 68%).

Two-thirds of Americans (65%) believe that the economy is worse than the media makes it out to be rather than better (35%).

In August the unemployment rate was 3.8%, close to a 50-year low. But the poll found that 51% wrongly believe that unemployment is nearing a 50-year high rather than those who believe it’s actually low (49%).

The lack of confidence in the economy has many academics and politicians puzzled. Some have blamed the US’s polarized politics and this was illustrated in the poll. But Harris’s data also shows that fears are widespread – and reinforced by disbelief of or ignorance about official figures and a mistrust of the media’s reporting of them.

Some 82% of Republicans and 66% of independents believe the economy is worse than the media’s portrayal. But nearly half of Democrats (49%) also said the media viewed the economy too favorably.

Overall, the poll found widespread despondency about the state of the economy. More than half of Americans (53%) believe the economy is getting worse instead of better or staying the same. Republicans and independents are more likely to think it’s getting worse (72% and 58%, respectively, v Democrats: 32%), while more Democrats think it’s getting better (32% v Republicans: 8%, independents: 13%).

The results paint a difficult picture for Joe Biden, who is making “Bidenomics” – his economic policy record – a central plank of his re-election platform.

The views of those familiar with Bidenomics showed a perhaps unsurprising party split. Some 60% of Democrats believe his plans are improving the US economy overall compared with 12% of Republicans.

There is a widespread belief that Bidenomics is good in theory but isn’t being implemented well – something both Democrats and Republicans agree with (62% v 58%).

Biden supporters have just launched a $13m advertising campaign extolling the president’s economic achievements, which include a landmark $1.2tn infrastructure and climate bill, massive investment in domestic microchips production and green energy solutions. His legislative actions are predicted to create 1.5m jobs per year for the next decade.

That message may be hard to sell given the widespread disbelief of and ignorance about the health of the US economy highlighted by the poll.

As well as being wrong about the unemployment data, respondents were unaware of, or chose to mischaracterize, other major economic data points.

The widest measure of economic growth – gross domestic product – increased at a 2.1% annualized rate last quarter and has been steadily improving since the Covid downturn. But more respondents (59%) believe that the US economy is shrinking this year than those who believe it is growing (41%). More Republicans (72%) and independents (63%) believe the economy is shrinking than do Democrats. But still, a sizeable 44% of Democrats believe the economy is shrinking.

The S&P 500 stock market index is up 16% so far this year. But 59% of respondents wrongly said they believe the S&P is down for the year compared with those who said they believe it is up (41%). The majority of all those asked said the S&P was down whether Republican (66%), independent (60%) or Democrat (52%).

US wages are, finally, growing faster than inflation. But 75% of those polled wrongfully believe that wages aren’t keeping up with inflation. That view is held by the majority of Republicans (84%), independents (75%) and Democrats (67%).

There was some good news for Biden. The poll found that 75% of respondents support at least one of the four main branches of Bidenomics: improving infrastructure, attracting high-tech electronics manufacturing, building clean energy manufacturing facilities and attracting more high-paying union jobs.

Still, 51% of Americans believe that government spending under the current administration is having a negative impact on the US economy (Republicans: 72%, independents: 54%, Democrats: 30%) rather than a positive impact (21%) or no impact (28%). And only just over a third of Democrats (35%) believe it’s having a positive impact (Republicans: 11%, independents: 16%).

“All these perceptual-reality gaps underscore Biden’s difficulty in claiming credit for economic gains. Americans either view the economy through their politics or aren’t feeling it in real life, or both,” said John Gerzema, the CEO of Harris Poll.","(0, 'GDP')"

In a major economic speech in Chicago, Biden said his administration’s efforts were sparking recovery after Republican policies had crushed America’s middle class. But the poll said only one in three U.S. adults approve of his economic leadership.

That 34% figure is even lower than his overall approval rating of 41%, according to the survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Biden’s approval figures have barely moved for the past year and a half, a source of concern for a president pursuing a second term on his ability to govern and focus on workers. He wants voters to connect local roads and bridge projects, factory construction and the rise of electric vehicles and renewable energy to the millions of dollars in initiatives he signed into law during the first two years of his administration.

“Bidenomics is about the future,” he declared in his Wednesday speech to cheering supporters. “Bidenomics is just another way of saying: Restore the American dream.”

At the same time, he sought to paint previous Republican tax cuts as deeply flawed, saying they helped the rich but failed the middle class for decades as the promised “trickle down” benefits never seemed to come to the less wealthy.

“The trickle down approach failed the middle class,” he said. “It failed America. It blew up the deficit. It increased inequity. And it weakened our infrastructure. It stripped the dignity, pride and hope out of communities, one after another.”

As he was departing Washington on Wednesday, Biden said he believes the U.S. will avoid the recession that many economic analysts have been expecting. Republican leaders such as House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said last year that the high inflation under Biden’s watch meant that “we are in a recession,” but that is not the case under economic definitions.

GOP officials say their tax cuts have encouraged business investments and profits that have improved pay for workers and bolstered the stock market, while greater government spending would cause prices to keep rising and waste money.

Indeed, the economy has steadily improved over the past year of Biden’s term in the White House.

The Conference Board said Tuesday that consumer confidence this month reached the highest level since January 2022. Unemployment stands near a historic low at 3.7%. The inflation that has plagued Biden’s presidency has fallen to 4% from a peak of 9.1% last June. But prices are still rising significantly faster than the Federal Reserve’s target of 2%, a worry for voters and a line of attack for Republican lawmakers and other presidential candidates.

And smoke from Canadian wildfires, evident in Chicago on Wednesday, has added a new cloud for workers and shoppers in the U.S. The White House said it’s monitoring the air quality in Chicago but would not cancel the president’s scheduled events, which included a campaign reception in addition to the speech on the economy.

The new poll identifies a weakness within Biden’s own base. Many of the Democrats he needs to marshal in 2024 are comparatively unenthusiastic about his economic record. Seventy-two percent within his party say they approve of his handling of his job overall, but just 60% say they approve of his handling of the economy.

By comparison, during the depths of the pandemic as unemployment spiked, Republicans approved by overwhelming numbers of then-President Donald Trump’s economic leadership. Only about 1 in 10 Republicans now approve of Biden overall or on the economy, a testament to the polarization that defines modern U.S. politics.

Sarah Husted, 40, said she voted in 2020 for Biden, but “I wasn’t thrilled with either candidate.”

Living in Lincoln, Nebraska, Husted said that she feels as though inflation is getting worse, especially with regard to utilities and housing. But she largely believes the economic turmoil still reflects the disruptions caused by the pandemic.

“I don’t think that President Biden is helping the situation as much as he could, but I don’t think it’s all his fault,” she said.

That take was shared by other poll respondents interviewed by AP who voted for Biden in 2020. They generally saw him as a president grappling with partisan divisions, global competition and the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic.

“He’s doing the best he can, but he can’t do anything without Congress,” said Alice Banner, 86, a retired nurse from Baltimore County, Maryland.

Ben Will, 34, noted the solid job growth during Biden’s presidency and said the infrastructure spending that Biden signed into law would help with growth.

“He’s doing a fantastic job with the cards that were dealt to him,” said Will, a marketing and advertising director from Reading, Pennsylvania.

Overall, 30% of U.S. adults say they think the national economy is good, up slightly from the 25% who said that last month, when the president and congressional Republicans were in the midst of negotiations over raising the nation’s debt limit and a historic government default was a risk. No more than about a third have called the economy good since 2021.

The administration is making a data-driven argument in addition to Biden’s speech. The Treasury Department released an analysis showing that spending on factory-related construction has doubled since 2021 after adjusting for inflation. White House economists issued a report that shows inflation is lower in the U.S. than the rest of industrialized nations in the Group of Seven.

White House aides believe that Biden’s speech on Wednesday can generate greater awareness of his policies and increase Democratic voters’ appreciation of the economy. While the president’s allies acknowledge that many Americans still hold dim views of the economy, they note that the actual economic data was far worse last November, when Democrats mounted a stronger-than-expected showing in the midterm elections.

Biden aides say they are encouraged by data showing Americans’ views can be changed by a consistent message reinforced on multiple fronts, which is what the president and his Cabinet are setting out to do by touring the U.S. over the next three weeks. Their hope is that repetition of Biden’s accomplishments, coupled with a contrast to GOP proposals to undo those initiatives, will stick with voters for 2024.

President Joe Biden is fighting to convince inflation-weary voters that the U.S. economy is healthy.

""America has the best economy in the world,"" he told NBC's ""TODAY"" on Monday, laying out an argument that is central to his reelection campaign.

America's economic standing in the world is becoming an early flashpoint on the campaign trail, where former President Donald Trump routinely depicts the United States as a commercial wasteland.

""We are a nation whose economy is collapsing into a cesspool of ruin, whose supply chain is broken, whose stores are not stocked, whose deliveries are not coming,"" Trump shouted at a Georgia rally last month.

But the numbers paint a different picture, one more in line with Biden's narrative of American economic dominance than Trump's apocalyptic warnings.

Inflation has fallen sharply from its 2022 highs, although it has ticked back up in the past several months.

""On inflation, it is too soon to say whether the recent readings represent more than just a bump,"" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday.

Meanwhile, U.S. gross domestic product grew 2.5% in 2023, significantly outpacing that of other developed economies, according to a January report from the International Monetary Fund. The IMF projected that the U.S. will hold that lead in 2024, though it expects the rate to come down to 2.1%.

Two other large advanced economies, Canada and Germany, lagged with 2023 GDP growth at 1.1% and negative 0.3%, respectively.

""The U.S. economy is leading the way for the global economy. It's driving the global economic train,"" Moody's chief economist Mark Zandi told CNBC.

As economists watch U.S. inflation's wobbly descent, the numbers still remain hot in developed economies worldwide. In Canada, for example, the consumer price index rose 3.9% in 2023 while in Germany, the inflation rate was 5.9%.

Countries calculate inflation differently, which makes direct comparisons difficult.

But Zandi said that even adjusting for the calculation discrepancies, the U.S. still looks good on the inflation front.

""Using the same methodology as let's say the European Union, the Fed's already at target, inflation is already below 2%,"" he said.

And even as interest rates spiked, the labor market has stayed strong. In March, U.S. private companies added 184,000 jobs, payrolls processing firm ADP reported on Wednesday, well ahead of the Dow Jones upwardly revised estimate of 155,000 jobs. It is the fastest employment growth the U.S. economy has seen since July 2023.

The stock market has also made record gains over the past several months and housing values have soared, though they have now begun to decline as inventory improves.

Besides sticky high prices that are projected to cool in the coming year, Zandi said that the fundamentals of the current U.S. economy are nearly ideal: ""The economy is picture perfect. It's hard to argue with it.""","(0, 'GDP')"

Story Highlights Sub-50% presidential job ratings have usually resulted in electoral defeat

Satisfaction, economy ratings similar to those for losing incumbents

37% say they are better off financially, 45% say worse off

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Several key indicators of the 2024 election environment indicate that President Joe Biden faces an uphill climb to win a second term. His job approval rating, Americans’ satisfaction with how things are going in the country and their confidence in the economy are below the levels associated with successful reelection bids in recent elections.

While Democrats hold a slight edge in national party identification and partisan leanings, that advantage is smaller than what it has been in past presidential elections won by Democratic incumbents.

In less direct measures of the electoral environment, Americans are more inclined to say that they are worse off financially, that it is harder to buy things and that the U.S. is as respected throughout the world as it was before Biden took office.

Biden’s fate will ultimately be determined by whether Americans’ views on these metrics improve over the course of the year (as they did for Bill Clinton in 1996 and Barack Obama in 2012), stay the same or get worse (as they did for George H.W. Bush in 1992 and Donald Trump in 2020).

Presidential Job Approval

Incumbent job approval is arguably the best predictor of reelection success. Presidents with approval ratings of 50% or higher close to Election Day have all been reelected. All but one president with a sub-50% approval rating lost, the exception being George W. Bush. He won reelection with a 48% approval rating in Gallup’s final 2004 preelection poll taken in late October. However, he registered multiple 50% readings earlier in the month and had a 51% approval rating among likely voters in that final survey.

Among the approval ratings that did not carry incumbents to victory, Trump’s 46% approval rating is the highest and Gerald Ford’s 45% is close behind. The inauspicious ratings descend from there, all the way down to 34% for George H.W. Bush.

Biden’s 41% job approval rating, the lowest among incumbents in January of an election year, puts him in a precarious spot. It has not been unusual for incumbents to be below the 50% threshold this early on. But Biden’s reelection may depend on his ability to boost his numbers close to that threshold, something Clinton, Obama and Richard Nixon were able to do but Trump and Ford were not. Other presidents, including George W. Bush, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter, saw significant declines in approval during their fourth year in office.

###Embeddable###

Satisfaction With the State of the Nation

Over the past four decades, incumbent presidents have still been reelected when majorities of Americans are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country, but the cutoff seems to be 30% satisfaction. Less than 30% of U.S. adults were satisfied at the time of the 1992 and 2020 elections when the elder Bush and Trump lost, whereas more than 30% were satisfied in the years incumbents won.

Biden started 2024 with 20% of Americans satisfied with the country’s direction. Obama and Clinton had similar marks in January of their reelection years but saw satisfaction increase as the year wore on. For Trump, the opposite was the case, as the relatively high 41% satisfaction in January 2020 was soon dashed by the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic downturn, as well as racial strife associated with the George Floyd killing.

###Embeddable###

Economic Evaluations

Although the economy is always a key issue in presidential election campaigns, Americans’ confidence in the economy is not always determinative of election outcomes. Gallup has computed its Economic Confidence Index in five presidential election years since 1992 when an incumbent sought reelection. The index summarizes Americans’ assessments of current national economic conditions and their perceptions of whether the economy is getting better or worse. Positive scores indicate economic optimism, and negative scores indicate pessimism, with a minimum theoretical score of -100 and a maximum of +100.

Among the past five incumbent elections, Americans were decidedly positive about the economy in one -- 1996, when Clinton was reelected -- and decidedly negative in one -- 1992, when George H.W. Bush was defeated. In 2004, 2012 and 2020, index scores were close to the scale’s zero midpoint, indicating neither positive nor negative views of the economy. In two of those elections (2004 and 2012), the incumbent prevailed, but in 2020, Trump lost, likely because the coronavirus pandemic overshadowed the economy as an issue.

Currently, Americans’ economic confidence is closer to that of 1992 than other incumbent election years. However, the index has been improving in recent months. Biden can hope that economic perceptions follow a similar trajectory to 2012. That year, confidence started more negative than positive but approached a more neutral rating by the election, which Obama won.

###Embeddable###

Party Identification and Leaning

Americans’ partisanship strongly aligns with how they will vote and is thus an important indicator of election outcomes. Democrats typically lead Republicans in Americans’ party preferences; therefore, the size of that lead indicates whether Democrats are in a strong or weak position.

Gallup’s January 2024 poll shows the Democratic Party with a three-point advantage over Republicans: 46% identify as or lean Democratic, and 43% identify as or lean Republican. If this were October, these figures would be concerning for Biden, as it would represent the smallest Democratic advantage in an incumbent election year, including 2004 when Republican George W. Bush won with Democrats holding a five-point edge. In years Democratic incumbents won (1996 and 2012), the Democrats’ party advantage was +10 and +7, respectively.

A possible silver lining for the Biden campaign is that Democrats’ party advantage has often increased between January and October or November of an election year. This has occurred in all election years featuring an incumbent since 1992.

###Embeddable###

While Democratic Party identification and leaning have increased in each of the past five election years involving an incumbent, that pattern has not occurred in other recent elections. In non-incumbent years, Democrats increased their advantage in one (2000), saw no change in another (2016) and saw it shrink in one (2008).

Better Off Than Three Years Ago

Americans are evenly divided in their assessments of whether they are better off now than they were three years ago, with 48% saying they are and 47% saying they are not.

Gallup has asked this question in the early stages of previous election campaigns when incumbents were running for reelection. The current share of U.S. adults who say they are better off now is down from 2020’s pre-pandemic reading, but it is similar to the readings in prior election cycles. In 1992, 1996 and 2003, more Americans said they were better off, and two of the three presidents won reelection. In 2012, slightly more said they were not better off, but Obama still won another term.

###Embeddable###

Americans' perceptions of whether they are personally better off now than three years ago are largely influenced by their party leanings and, to a lesser extent, their income level. There is currently a wide gulf between Democrats’ (74%) and Republicans’ (22%) assessments of whether they are better off than three years ago, and independents are squarely in the middle of the two groups, at 48%.

This is the fifth election cycle of the past six that partisans in the same party as the sitting president seeking reelection are significantly more likely than their counterparts to say they are better off. The gaps in partisans’ reports since 1992 have ranged from four points in 1996 when Clinton ran for a second term to 60 points in 2020 when Trump ran. The current 52-point gap is the second highest.

###Embeddable###

Meanwhile, 53% of those in upper-income households and 50% in middle-income households say they are better off, compared with 41% in lower-income households.

The “better off than three years ago” question is typically only asked early in election campaigns. Near the end of prior campaigns, Gallup has asked Americans whether they were better off than four years ago. That question has not shown an obvious relationship to election outcomes, exemplified by the high scores in the 2020 election that Trump eventually lost and weaker scores in Reagan’s 1984 landslide.

Personal Finances

While the current U.S. inflation rate is far below its 9.1% recent peak in June 2022, it is about twice what it was in November 2020, and many Americans continue to struggle because of high prices. Only 35% of U.S. adults say it is easier to buy things at stores than it was three years ago, while 59% say it is not.

The share of Americans who currently say shopping is not easier is higher than in 1992, 1996, 2003 and 2020. The question was not asked in other presidential election cycles and is not asked at the end of campaigns.

The previous reading from January 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic forced widespread shutdowns, showed a slim 52% majority saying it was easier for them to make purchases than three years ago, and 36% said it was not.

###Embeddable###

Americans’ reports of their own financial situation are also more negative now than in early 2020. Currently, 37% of U.S. adults say they are financially better off than a year ago, 45% say they are worse off, and 16% volunteer that they are the same. These readings are similar to last year’s but sharply different from the last election year, 2020, when 59% reported being better off and 20% worse off.

###Embeddable###

Looking ahead, a steady 61% majority of Americans think they will be financially better off in a year, but this is lower than the 74% who said the same in 2020.

Readings on these personal finance measures differ significantly by party identification, with Democrats much more positive than Republicans. Democrats (58%) are more than four times as likely as Republicans (14%) to say buying things is easier than it was three years ago. Similarly, Democrats (57%) are nearly three times as likely as their Republican counterparts (20%) to say their personal financial situation is better now than three years ago. Independents’ views on both are closer to Republicans’, as 33% say shopping is easier and 35% report an improvement in their financial situation.

There is no significant difference by household income level in views of buying power, as majorities across income groups say it is not easier to shop. However, lower-income (32%) and middle-income households (36%) are less likely than upper-income households (47%) to say their personal financial situation is better than one year ago.

U.S. International Respect

When it comes to foreign policy, only about one-quarter of Americans, 27%, think the U.S. is as respected throughout the world as it was three years ago, while 67% say it is not. Just 3% volunteer that it is more respected now. Americans were similarly pessimistic about the United States’ international standing in past election years, with no more than 40% (in 1992 and 2000) believing respect for the U.S. remained intact. The current reading is identical to 2003 and similar to 2012 (30%).

###Embeddable###

The U.S. has had varying degrees of involvement in world affairs over the past three years, ranging from its military departure from Afghanistan in 2021, its support for Ukraine in the Russia-Ukraine war, and its military support for Israel following the October 2023 Hamas invasion of Israel, which resulted in an Israeli military operation in Gaza. Both the Russia-Ukraine and Hamas-Israeli wars are ongoing, and Americans are sharply divided over the proper U.S. role in each.

Democrats are split in their view of whether the U.S. is as respected around the world as it was three years ago, with 47% saying it is and 44% saying it is not. At the same time, 7% of Republicans think the U.S. is as respected, and 91% think it is not. Independents fall in between the partisan groups, with 27% saying it is respected and 67% saying it is not.

Bottom Line

Biden’s reelection chances do not look very favorable in early 2024. His job approval rating is lower than all recent incumbents at the same point, including those who ultimately lost the election, and key national mood indicators are more in line with those for past losers than winners. Party identification offers Biden some hope but depends on Democrats making gains rather than holding steady in national support, something that has happened at least slightly in each of the past five incumbent elections.

Biden’s chances may rest on him experiencing a comeback similar to what Obama achieved in 2012 when Biden was serving as vice president. That year, national mood indicators and Obama’s job approval rating significantly improved during the campaign, and the president was elected to a second term. Unlike Obama, though, Biden also faces questions about his age and ability to carry out his duties in a second term. Biden is also starting at a lower point in job approval than Obama did, meaning he has to show a bigger improvement.

Biden won his first term after national mood indicators worsened throughout the 2020 election year, which led to his defeating Trump, the incumbent.

Many Americans continue to struggle financially, and Biden has so far been unable to convince voters of the economy's health or his accomplishments. If he cannot do so by the summer, particularly before the Democratic National Convention, his chances of winning reelection will grow increasingly bleak.

127,High inflation and interest rates are coming at a bad time for Biden - The Washington Post,High inflation and interest rates are coming at a bad time for Biden  The Washington Post,"Sat, 13 Apr 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDI0LzA0LzEzL2JpZGVuLWluZmxhdGlvbi1mZWRlcmFsLXJlc2VydmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Washington Post,"The booming economy is exacerbating a key vulnerability for President Biden heading into the height of campaign season, as inflation and interest rates could remain higher until deep into the final weeks of the presidential election. Fresh data this week shows inflation picked up again in March, in the latest sign that the economy is overheating. Unexpectedly strong job growth, wages and consumer spending are a plus for most Americans but bad for inflation. The higher inflation reading makes it more likely that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates — and mortgage rates — elevated until late in the year, possibly until days after the election, eluding much political gain for Biden.

“It’s really a case of bad luck,” said Karen Dynan, a professor at Harvard University and former Treasury Department chief economist. “The Biden administration has made some big strides but it’s up against one of the most disruptive economies in decades. Rate cuts would be a welcome development for a lot of people, but the prospects for cuts have really changed given what’s happening with inflation.”

Gasoline prices, in particular, have always played an outsize role in how Americans feel about the economy. The average price of a gallon of gas has been creeping up in the past two months to $3.63 a gallon on Friday, according to AAA. Fears of rising prices could already be weighing on Americans anew, as consumer sentiment fell unexpectedly in April, according to a University of Michigan survey released Friday.

A booming economy can fuel inflation if spending is so robust that consumers are willing to pay ever-higher prices for goods and services. Consumer spending makes up two-thirds of the U.S. economy, and so far Americans have been more than happy to splurge on services like dining out, travel and hotel stays, despite inflation. That’s forced businesses to ramp up hiring — and raise wages — which in turn pushes prices even higher.

Biden aides point out that the current inflation reading, at 3.5 percent, is below what it was at similar points in President Bill Clinton’s and President Ronald Reagan’s tenures, when year-on-year inflation was at 3.6 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively. Both went on to win reelection.

“Our agenda to lower costs on behalf of working families is as urgent today as it was yesterday,” said Jared Bernstein, chair of Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers. “We’re just going to keep our heads down and continue fighting to lower costs from prescription drugs to junk fees to housing and child care.”

For much of his presidency, Biden has struggled with his message on the economy. When inflation first started to beset the country in the months after the pandemic, the president and his team settled on describing it as “transitory,” trying to signal to voters that the spike was temporary and would subside. When Russia invaded Ukraine, the White House started using the phrase “Putin’s price hike,” blaming the war for rising gas prices.

As inflation dropped, Biden try to rebrand “Bidenomics,” originally used derisively by conservative media, in an attempt to gain credit from voters for a booming job market and growing economy. But as economists have struggled to explain the topsy-turvy economy after covid, Biden has struggled, too.

The president and his aides have been frustrated that they have not received more credit for avoiding a recession and passing massive legislation, specifically the infrastructure law and the CHIPS Act, which will transform the United States’ roads and bridges and turbocharge a domestic semiconductor industry. Aides have been divided over how to sell Biden’s legislative accomplishments while many Americans say they are having trouble affording groceries and other household items.

That dispute spilled into public view this week after Politico published audio of former White House chief of staff Ron Klain, who remains close to Biden, criticizing the White House’s economic messaging. During a conference, Klain said Biden spends too much time touting new bridges and not enough on rising prices.

The White House says Biden can, and must, do both.

“He understands what the Americans are facing,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters this week when asked about Klain’s comments. “And he’s talked at almost every — every event that he’s had — crisscrossing the country after the State of the Union — about lowering costs, how important it is, and how there’s more work to do. You hear that.”

On Saturday, the White House put out a new memo on the economy, debuting a message centered on Trump, warning that if he’s reelected, inflation would climb higher.

“While President Biden’s vision for economic growth is based on strengthening the middle class, lowering prices, and defeating inflation, MAGAnomics is the opposite — a recipe for supercharging inflation and costs for the middle-class with policies that put the wealthy above everyone else,” Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, wrote in the memo.

But, as inflation heats back up, the White House is under renewed pressure to quell Americans’ economic anxieties. Stock markets tumbled this week as investors realized a rate cut was no longer imminent.

Bank of America this week said it does not expect the Fed to begin scaling back on interest rates until December, six months later than its original forecast. “We no longer think policymakers will gain the confidence they need to start cutting in June,” Michael Gapen, the bank’s U.S. economist said in an analyst note. It also expects the Fed to cut less than it had previously thought.

The president this week took the unusual step of commenting on the Fed’s next move, saying he stands by his prediction that the central bank will cut rates by the end of the year. Biden has generally been careful to keep his distance from the Fed, saying he respects the central bank’s independence.

In a twist, the election itself could delay the Fed’s plans. Investors generally expect the central bank to steer clear of policy changes in the lead-up to the presidential race, out of concern that it could be seen favoring one candidate over another.

“It’s hard to imagine the Fed cutting rates aggressively before November,” said Glenn Hubbard, a professor at Columbia Business School who served as an economic adviser to President George W. Bush. “I just don’t see it happening — that’s not a political judgment, it’s just arithmetic.”

Inflation, which peaked at 9.1 percent in June 2022, has come down dramatically since then, with meaningful drops in just about every category of goods and services. In some cases, big-ticket items like cars, furniture and appliances, have actually gotten cheaper in the past year.

But in recent months, progress has petered out. Inflation picked up in March — with prices up 3.5 percent from a year earlier, compared with a 3.2 percent increase the month before. A range of basics — including car insurance, women’s coats, pork chops and visits to the vet — were about 3 percent more expensive than they were in February.

Chad Barrett, 36, who owns a solar-panel business in West Palm Beach, Fla., says inflation and high borrowing costs have forced him to reconsider his vote for Biden. Barrett, a lifelong Democrat who once campaigned for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), plans to cast a “protest vote,” either for a third-party candidate or a write-in.

Until this week, Barrett had been hopeful that the Fed would start lowering interest rates in the next couple of months, offering some relief. But that seems unlikely now — which means he’s already getting notices from lenders that his borrowing costs will go up soon.

“All I hear is, ‘This economy is great, it’s amazing,’ but I’m a millennial who doesn’t own a home and everything is going up in cost,” he said. “It’s a mix of disappointment and frustration.”

In his rematch against former president Donald Trump, Biden has increasingly tried to contrast his economic record with Trump’s.

“We’re in a situation where we’re better situated than we were when we took office where we — inflation was skyrocketing,” Biden said at a news conference Wednesday. “And we have a plan to deal with it, whereas the opposition — my opposition talks about two things. They just want to cut taxes for the wealthy and raise taxes on other people. And so, I think they’re — they have no plan. Our plan is one I think is still sustainable.”

As the president struggles to connect on the economy, though, his campaign is eager to focus on the issue of abortion. Democrats have found electoral success since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, and they are spending millions of dollars to remind voters that Trump was the architect of that decision. As states around the country institute even more restrictive abortion bans, Democrats are optimistic the issue will outweigh the economy for core Democratic base voters, but also potentially disaffected Republicans.

In Fultonville, N.Y., Pam Marshall and her community have been hit hard by rising prices. But the single mom, who left the Republican Party after the Jan. 6 attack, says abortion rights take precedence over economic issues. She plans to vote for Biden in November.","(3, 'inflation')"

Some 46% of people now call their personal financial situation poor, up from 37% in March, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. That’s a notable downturn at a particularly inopportune moment for Biden, given that the share of Americans who felt positive about their finances had stayed rock steady over the last few years — even during the economic turmoil of the COVID-19 pandemic.

And while a majority of Americans see high prices as beyond Biden’s control, they continue to disapprove of his handling of the economy overall.

Overall, 54% say their finances are good in the latest survey. That figure was at least 62% through the global recession caused by the pandemic in 2020, and even in late 2021 and early 2022 as prices began to rise across the country. But inflation’s prolonged bite has left the U.S. and wider world facing the possibility of a downturn and, despite solid job growth, more consumers are feeling the pain.

In Salado, Texas, Bethany Saunders saw the rate she paid for electricity double in August, and her water bill jumped as well as she dealt with a summer heat and drought. Her utilities bills totaled $800, a shock to the 43-year-old, who had carefully budgeted after going without a pay raise for two years.

“That just drained my bank account — I’m not rich, but I knew what I could live on,” said Saunders, who voted Republican in 2020 and plans to do so again this year.

Overall, views of Biden and of the direction of the country held steady in October, after improving somewhat in September. Forty-three percent say they approve of how Biden is handling his job as president, while 25% say the country is headed in the right direction. Biden’s approval rating had dropped as low as 36% in a July AP-NORC poll, and the percentage saying the country is headed in the right direction dropped as low as 14% in June.

The president has been steadfast in saying he believes the economy can escape a recession, and he said in an interview broadcast Tuesday by CNN that any potential downturn would be modest.

“I don’t think there will be a recession,” Biden told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “If it is, it’ll be a very slight recession. That is, we’ll move down slightly.”

Saunders doesn’t think Biden is entirely to blame for her higher bills, but she said h is $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package from last year with its direct payments to Americans was excessive. Some leading economists say the money helped ignite inflation that reached a 40-year peak in June. The government will release an inflation report on Thursday, and economists expect it to show that prices rose 8.1% in September from a year ago.

“I see him throwing money at things we don’t need,” Saunders said of Biden. “It makes me think of the Oprah episode that became famous. ‘You get a car, you get a car, you get a car.’”

The drop in financial well-being was especially acute among Americans in households making less than $50,000 a year, just 33% of whom now call their personal finances good compared with 50% in March. Sixty-one percent of those in household making between $50,000 and $100,000 call their personal finances good, as do 75% of those making more than that — both down only slightly since earlier in the year.

In the latest poll, 23% call the national economy good. That’s similar to the percentage in June but down slightly from 29% in September, when views of the national economy had shown signs of improvement. The drop since September came primarily among Democrats, from 46% then to 35% now. In September, Democrats had appeared increasingly optimistic about the economy compared with earlier in the summer.

Sandra Baker, 56, said she voted for Biden and intends to support Democrats in this year’s elections. The Lincoln, Nebraska resident said the president is trying his best to fix the economy and address political divides.

“He’s doing all he can do, but everything else is so screwed up it doesn’t really matter,” Baker said. “The general vibe — everything the Democrats do — seems to be toward helping the little man and it’s always been like that.”

But the economy has proved a challenge — with gasoline costs becoming a renewed source of financial pressure. The average price at the pump was $3.92 a gallon on Wednesday, up roughly 5.5% from a month ago, according to AAA. Support for Biden had picked up after a 99-day drop in gas prices from a June high that ended in September.

Views of Biden’s handling of the economy remain underwater. Only 36% say they approve and 63% disapprove. But Americans aren’t heaping all the blame for inflation at Biden’s feet: 55% say higher than usual prices are mostly because of factors outside Biden’s control, while 44% say that’s happening mostly because of Biden’s policies.

The president has blamed rising energy and food prices on Russia’s February invasion of Ukraine. He’s also blasted oil companies and refineries for raking in profits off the higher prices, instead of doing more to increase production. Saudi Arabia and other countries tied to OPEC dealt the U.S. a further blow last week by announcing plans to cut oil production by 2 million barrels a day in response to the slowing economy, a move that the administration said would support oil exporters such as Russia.

There are bright spots in the poll for Biden — 55% say they approve of how he’s handling the coronavirus pandemic, long one of his strongest issues, and 63% approve of his handling of natural disaster relief following Hurricane Ian, which battered Florida two weeks ago. On the other hand, just 39% approve of how Biden is handling immigration.

Most adults still consider the national economy to be in poor shape, but there has been a slight increase in those who have a positive opinion. However, this improvement in the view of the economy has not translated into an improvement in President Biden’s approval ratings.

Thirty-five percent say the national economy is good, up slightly from 30% in an AP-NORC poll conducted in December and 24% in January 2023. The economy is seen as poor by 65%, down from 69% in December and 76% a year ago. Both Democrats and Republicans are more likely to describe the economy as good compared with last January. But, while 58% of Democrats now have a positive opinion of the economy, only 15% of Republicans agree.

Thirty-eight percent approve of Biden’s job performance, including 70% of Democrats and just 7% of Republicans. The public has similar opinions about how the president is handling foreign policy in general, and specifically relations with China, as well as the economy.

Biden’s approval on both his overall job as president and his handling of the economy are similar to the last several months, with his rating on the economy remaining below 40%.

While Democrats overall have positive views of Biden, Democrats ages 18 to 39 are much more negative than older Democrats.

The nationwide poll was conducted January 25-29, 2024 using the AmeriSpeak® Panel, the probability-based panel of NORC at the University of Chicago. Online and telephone interviews using landlines and cell phones were conducted with 1,152 adults. The margin of sampling error is +/- 4.0 percentage points.","(0, 'GDP')"

What is being presented as an argument about one question is actually an argument about three different questions:

Is the economy good? Did Joe Biden do a good job with the economy given political constraints? Why do people say the economy is bad when asked by survey takers?

Each of these questions is interesting when analyzed separately. But when you mush them together without realizing you are doing that, you end up in a rhetorical quagmire that causes frustration and confusion.

My interest in the debate is mostly on question number one, i.e. whether the economy is good. When I was introduced to this discourse, this seemed to be what people were arguing about, with the consensus sentiment from liberal thought-leaders being that the economy is not only good, but is extremely good, and that any viewpoint to the contrary is bad faith, borderline insane, or factually bankrupt.

I found this peculiar, because whether the economy is good or bad is, at minimum, a highly contestable question that turns as much on your ideological views about what makes an economy good as it does on various factual indicators.

If we take a snapshot of the current economy and ask whether it is good or bad, certainly anyone with conventional leftist views on economics would say that it is bad. The welfare state is bad. Unionization is low. Public ownership is low. Inequality is high.

This negative assessment is not based on some pie-in-the-sky baseline for a good economy either: we hugely trail many of our developed-nation peers on those metrics. Nor is this baseline being opportunistically selected: the Left spent five years lining up behind a Bernie Sanders campaign that had as its core premise that an economy that looks like what we have right now is really awful.

If we look only at recent changes in the economy, what we see is a very mixed bag. On the one hand, the recovery from the COVID recession has increased employment and compressed the wage schedule, both good things. On the other hand, the rollback of the COVID welfare state has seen free school meals eliminated, cash benefits for the poorest kids eliminated, ten million people kicked off Medicaid, and the return of our completely dysfunctional unemployment benefit system, all bad things.

The question of how exactly to combine these conflicting developments to generate a net assessment of recent changes presents the usual incommensurability problems and therefore heated debate. My simple attempt to net this all out by looking at recent developments in disposable income is presented in the graph below. This disposable income concept includes labor market and welfare state developments in it, but it does not fully settle the debate either.

As I have proliferated this argument over the past few weeks, what I have found is that people respond by changing the subject to questions two and three. So they acknowledge that obviously social democrats must think the current economy is bad and must think that these recent welfare cuts were bad, but then say either that these things are not Biden’s fault or that survey respondents who say the economy is bad are doing so for other reasons.

These latter two questions are of much less interest to me, in large part because there is no real good way to argue about them.

The genius of a government with so many veto points is that it’s impossible to assign blame or credit to anyone for almost anything because no single person or government body is a sufficient cause of most government actions. In practice what this means is that partisans credit the president for everything that passes even though he cannot unilaterally pass anything, but do not blame him for anything that fails to pass because, after all, he cannot unilaterally pass anything.

As to what motivates survey respondents, it’s clear enough that a lot of survey responding is “expressive” in the sense that people don’t attempt to answer the question that is presented to them but instead, consciously or subconsciously, use the question as a proxy for things like “do you like the president” or “how do you feel about the state of the country” or similar. The funniest example of this I have seen is that, shortly after Biden was elected, the percent of Democratic survey respondents who said they felt financially comfortable buying a new refrigerator massively shot up.

A couple of years ago, it became popular to dismiss polling that showed people liked progressive ideas by saying it was unreliable. But weirdly those taking that position presented as their alternative other polling that worded questions about these ideas differently in order to generate more negative responses. Now it seems maybe they are finally coming around to the more natural conclusion that topical polling is itself meaningless, not just when it shows support for public health insurance.

In any case, as interesting as questions about Biden’s culpability and survey behavior are, it is important not to conceptually muddle them with the question of whether the economy is good. Proving that Biden did the best he can and that survey respondents are stupid or expressive does not actually prove that the economy is good. By conventional social democratic measures, the economy is bad, and recent trends in the economy have been mixed at best. Any conclusion to the contrary is therefore based on ideological, not factual, disagreement.","(0, 'GDP')"

Rising prices are largely to blame. New data coming out Tuesday is expected to show that inflation once again lessened its grip on households in October, extending a year-long trend. That comes on top of a string of eye-popping data points — strong economic growth, unemployment at longtime lows, wages finally outpacing inflation, all leaving Americans with more money in their bank accounts than they have had in years.

President Biden has played a considerable role in improving Americans’ financial situation, through legislative victories that have yielded a surge in government funding and related private investment, which is building electric vehicles, new bridges, airport upgrades and a host of other infrastructure and green energy projects that have juiced the economy.

Yet Americans are still angry that prices rose as much as they did, showing up in consumer sentiment that has fallen for three straight months. Just 30 percent of voters approve of President Biden’s handling of the economy, the lowest reading since he took office, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll.

That disconnect between a booming economy and how Americans feel about it appears to be widening at a critical time ahead of next year’s presidential election. It is also shaping up to be a key liability for the White House, even as its policies are bolstering job creation and business investments.

For many voters, the economy’s recent growth comes alongside other realities, such as high inflation, rising interest rates that have made loans more costly and dwindling savings. Importantly, home prices are at an all-time high, and housing affordability is near a record low, which is also influencing people’s feelings about their finances.

“Those are all very salient things: how much you’re spending at the grocery store, how much you’re paying in rent, whether you can afford to move,” said Jonathan Rothwell, principal economist at polling giant Gallup. “Those factors are very important to people’s sense of how the economy is doing, and they’re not performing well.”

Inflation, at 3.7 percent, has come down dramatically from last summer’s high of 9.1 percent and is expected to decline even further in this week’s reading. But it’s still well above what policymakers would like and has become a sticking point for households across the country. Basic expenses, such as food, housing and transportation, are considerably higher than they were a year ago, even as energy prices have declined.

At the same time, families are quickly spending down the trillions in extra cash they had amassed during the pandemic. There is a growing sense among Americans, economists say, that they’re having to overspend to maintain their pre-pandemic standard of living, which is clouding their view of the broader economy.

That’s creating ongoing challenges for the president. The White House has been playing up its “Bidenomics” plan — which has spurred more than $1 trillion in public and private investments in infrastructure, clean energy and semiconductors — with creating new jobs and helping workers secure higher wages. That money is already making its way through the economy and boosting growth.

But the bigger struggle, political analysts say, has been making it clear to Americans that the local improvements they’re seeing, in roads, high-speed internet connections and airports, are being powered by Biden’s policies. Many federal funds are being doled out through state and local governments, and are often going to businesses and contractors instead of directly to families.

“‘Bidenomics’ is the right plan. It’s the right approach, and we need to just work every day to show Americans how it is delivering for them around the kitchen table,” Lael Brainard, director of the National Economic Council, said in an interview. “That’s our focus: trying to make that connection that clean drinking water, affordable high-speed internet, lower drug prices, better jobs — these are all things the president is delivering every day.”

So far, the message appears to be falling flat. A recent New York Times/Siena poll shows that a vast majority of voters in battleground states — 81 percent — say the economy is “fair” or “poor.” Meanwhile, 59 percent of voters in those states said they trusted Trump’s handling of the economy over Biden’s.

Those low marks come even as the U.S. economy has, by many measures, notched quarter after quarter of strong growth. Employers have added 14 million jobs under Biden’s watch, and household wealth surged during the pandemic. The median net worth of U.S. families grew by an unprecedented 37 percent between 2019 and 2022, to $192,900, according to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances.

But there are also signs the biggest income gains went to the wealthiest Americans, according to the Fed’s survey, while average incomes inched down for those at the bottom.

“A lot of the gains that have been reported in the economy have been oriented toward wealthier people,” said Stephen Moore, an economist at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, and an economic adviser to President Donald Trump. “People are feeling financially stressed because over the last two years, inflation has gone up and they’re falling behind.”

Recent union victories could help push wages even higher. In the last four months, hundreds of thousands of workers — including delivery truck drivers, health-care workers, Hollywood writers and, most recently, autoworkers and actors — have secured historic union contracts with higher pay and more job security.

The president made history this fall when he joined autoworkers on the picket line and played a supporting role in getting the deal done, making phone calls to automakers and urging them to stick to the negotiating table. Meanwhile, top Labor Department officials have been involved in recent union negotiations, including at Kaiser Permanente, where 85,000 health-care workers last week ratified a four-year contract that bumps the minimum wage to at least $23 and gives existing workers a 21 percent raise.

“This is a moment for workers, in which workers are winning at the bargaining table, they’re winning in the workplace,” said Julie Su, the Labor Department’s acting secretary. “All of those things did not happen by accident. They happened because this president has been very clear that when we build an economy that does right by workers, that’s good for employers and that’s good for the nation.”

Whether that will translate to higher approval ratings or votes, though, is unclear. White House officials say the strong economy and tight labor market made these contract negotiations possible in the first place, by giving workers the leverage to demand better working conditions. At the same time, union workers in some states have moved away from the Democratic Party in recent elections.

“The big problem for Democrats right now is that Trump did very well with Blue Collar America, no question about it, and a lot of those blue-collar workers are union workers,” Moore of the Heritage Foundation said. “It’s quite possible that by winning these big union concessions, that some of them will migrate back to the Democrats. But if I were a Democrat, I’d be very nervous about the abandonment of the rank-and-file union members.”

The Biden administration though, has a year to turn around its approval ratings and convince Americans that it’s doing enough to improve their financial standing. White House officials say they feel optimistic that Americans will begin to feel better about the economy, particularly as energy costs continue to recede. Average gas prices nationwide have fallen roughly 11 percent in the last year, from $3.80 a gallon to $3.40 a gallon, according to AAA.

The administration is also working to drive down health-care costs by capping prescription drug prices for seniors on insulin, for example, which “will help Americans feel more confident,” according to a senior White House official.

“We are still recovering from the pandemic and its devastating effects on the economy,” said Su. “Workers are, like everybody else, reassessing their role in the economy. They’ve had four decades of increased productivity but stagnating wages. It’s going to take some time for us to build an economy in which those concerns are addressed.”

By any measure, Robert Huber and his fiancée are doing well: They make six figures apiece, have gotten consistent raises and are preparing to close on a custom-built house in Midlothian, Va.

Still, he said they feel the continued squeeze of inflation.

“With food and utilities going up, it doesn’t matter what your budget level is — we’re all feeling the pinch,” said Huber, 46, who works in health-care sales. “We’re doing well, but we’ve certainly cut back on things. When you go to the grocery store and steaks are $14 a pound, when they used to be $7 a pound, it’s like, ‘Eh, maybe I’ll get something else for dinner today.’ It forces you to rethink your budget.”

Huber, a registered Independent who voted for Biden in 2020, said he plans to do so again. He doesn’t blame the president for rising prices — after all, he said, many other parts of the world have it much worse. But he said the administration could be doing more to connect with Americans.

This is the first phase of the new Tech Hubs program, which is an economic development initiative designed to drive regional innovation and job creation by strengthening a region’s capacity to manufacture, commercialize, and deploy technology that will advance American competitiveness. The program invests directly in burgeoning, high-potential U.S. regions and aims to transform them into globally competitive innovation centers.

Tech Hubs was authorized by the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, a key part of President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, which he signed into law in August 2022.

These Tech Hubs are located across 32 states and Puerto Rico, and represent a cross-section of urban and rural regions. Designation is an endorsement of the region’s plans to supercharge their respective technological industries to create jobs, strengthen U.S. competitiveness, and protect national security. The Tech Hubs announced today focus on industries ranging from autonomous systems, quantum computing, biotechnology, precision medicine, clean energy advancement, semiconductor manufacturing, and more, and highlight how the Biden Harris Administration is investing in innovation and economic growth in every region of the United States.

EDA also awarded 29 Strategy Development Grants (SDG) to help communities significantly increase local coordination and planning activities. Such development could make selected grantees more competitive for future Tech Hubs funding opportunities.

“President Biden’s Investing in America agenda is rooted in policies that will empower the United States to out-innovate and out-compete the rest of the world. Our Tech Hubs Program is fundamental to that mission and will supercharge innovation across the nation by spurring cutting-edge technological investments and creating 21st century job opportunities in people’s backyards,” said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “Each of these consortia will help us ensure the industries of the future—and their good-paying jobs—start, grow, and remain in the United States.”

“Innovation, cutting-edge research, and creativity can be found in every community across America. Thanks to President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda, the Tech Hubs program is seizing that potential and investing in regional consortia that will boost U.S. manufacturing, create more good-paying jobs and bolster U.S. global competitiveness,” said Deputy Secretary of Commerce Don Graves. “The phase 1 designees and grant recipients reflect the diverse technological industries growing here at home and are symbols of American innovation and opportunity. The Tech Hubs program will provide them tools and resources to drive economic growth across the nation, which Americans will feel for generations to come.”

“President Biden’s Tech Hubs program will catalyze technological advances in communities across America, laying the foundations for future centers of world class innovation, manufacturing, and good paying jobs,” said Director of the National Economic Council Lael Brainard.

The Phase 1 winners were selected from nearly 400 applications from regional consortia that include industry, academia, state and local governments, economic development organizations, and labor and workforce partners. As part of the Tech Hubs competition, each consortium outlined plans for strengthening its region’s capacity to manufacture, commercialize, and deploy critical technologies.

“These outstanding Tech Hubs Designees exemplify place-based economic development strategies at their best: combining federal resources with regional assets, expertise, and coalitions to implement transformational opportunities, said Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Development Alejandra Y. Castillo. “As each region develops its own strategy to catalyze innovation and job creation, the entire nation grows more secure and more competitive.”

Today, the Department of Commerce launched a second Tech Hubs Notice of Funding Opportunity, allowing these designated Tech Hubs to apply to receive between $40 million and $70 million each for implementation funding, totaling nearly $500 million.

134,Biden's economic ratings are worse than Carter's - CNN,Biden's economic ratings are worse than Carter's  CNN,"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8xMi8yMS9wb2xpdGljcy9qb2UtYmlkZW4tamltbXktY2FydGVyLWVjb25vbWljLXJhdGluZ3MvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBU2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjEvMTIvMjEvcG9saXRpY3Mvam9lLWJpZGVuLWppbW15LWNhcnRlci1lY29ub21pYy1yYXRpbmdz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,CNN,"CNN —

President Joe Biden is struggling in the minds of the American public. While his approval rating is down on a slew of issues, his difficulties are perhaps most noticeable on the economy.

Biden now sports the lowest net economic rating of any president at this point through their first term since at least Jimmy Carter in 1977.

In the latest CNN/SSRS poll, Biden comes in with a 44% approval rating to 55% disapproval rating among registered voters on his economic performance. This makes for a -9 point net approval rating. The average of all polls taken in December is quite similar with Biden at -13 points on the economy.

To put that in perspective, the average president at this point in the last 44 years (since we have been polling on the topic) had a net economic approval rating of +5 points. That means Biden’s is 18 points worse than the average.

The best rating, perhaps unsurprisingly, belonged to George W. Bush following the September 11 attacks. He was at +37 points at a time when his approval ratings on all issues were high thanks to the “rally around the flag” effect.

Notably, Biden’s net rating is worse than his two immediate predecessors, Barack Obama in December 2009 and Donald Trump in December 2017. Both Obama and Trump had net approval ratings on the economy of -4 points.

The economy was, by a lot of measures, in deep trouble in December 2009. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index was well below average at 72.5. Today, it’s at a similar 70.4. Yet, Biden’s ratings on the economy are considerably worse.

Trump was a different story. Consumer sentiment was at 95.9 in December 2017, but Trump’s overall net approval ratings (-20 points) were so bad that they were dragging down his popularity on a host of issues.

Interestingly, Trump’s problem then is the opposite of Biden’s now. Back in late 2017, most voters were not concentrated on the economy. It was not the nation’s top problem. Ergo, what Americans saw as a relatively stronger economy wasn’t translating into helping Trump.

Today, the economy is viewed as the top problem for both the nation and for people’s families, so the low consumer sentiment is dragging Biden down. A Monmouth University poll released earlier this month found that 41% listed economic concerns (either everyday bills and groceries; inflation; job security and employment; or the economy overall) as the top issue for their family. That’s far more than for any other issue.

Inflation, in particular, seems to be a big issue for Biden. Just 28% of Americans approved of the job he is doing to handle inflation in a recent ABC News/Ipsos poll. This comes as more voters said they were concerned about inflation than any other issue in a December Fox News poll, and only 22% said the Biden’s administration efforts to get inflation and rising prices under control were helping. The plurality (47%) said they were hurting.

Indeed, the issue of inflation hurting a president helps to put Biden’s bad position in perspective. The public reaction now looks at least somewhat similar to how the public was reacting to another president under whom inflation was an issue: Carter.

A lot of Republicans like to draw parallels between Carter (who was a one-term president) and Biden. And at least early on, when it comes to public perceptions of the economy and inflation, there are some similarities between them.

Carter’s economic net approval rating of -8 points in an early January 1978 CBS News/New York Times poll was the lowest around this point in a presidency before Biden’s -13 points. The economy, and particularly inflation, was listed as the nation’s top problem in a late October 1977 Gallup poll.

Importantly, far more Americans (52%) in a November 1977 Time Magazine poll thought that Carter was not making a good start to fighting inflation than thought he was (21%). In other words, Americans felt his efforts were not enough to control inflation.

The good news for Biden is that it’s far from clear what the economy and inflation will look like in the future. Carter ended up losing in 1980, in part, because voters felt he didn’t solve the economic crisis. Biden, on the other hand, still has nearly three years until the 2024 election, although his party may still suffer in the midterms because of fears voters have about the economy.","(0, 'GDP')"

Inflation is at a 40-year record high. Yet, President Joe Biden and his administration say that the economy is better than ever. This week, Distinguished Visiting Fellow Stephen Moore explains the truth about Joe Biden’s economy.

Michelle Cordero: From The Heritage Foundation, I'm Michelle Cordero and this is Heritage Explains.

Cordero: Inflation rates hit a 40 year high last week, coming in at 9.1%. The cost of everyday staples also increased. The price of eggs went up 33.1%, meat 8.2%, gasoline 59.9%, used cars 7.1% and air travel 34.1%. This is all in addition to supply shortages. Yet as the economy is flashing huge red warning signs, President Joe Biden and his administration are telling us something different.

Joe Biden: Look, here's where we are. We have the fastest growing economy in the world, the world, the world. We have 8.6 million new jobs just since I got in an office. Unemployment rates down to 3.6%. We've reduced the deficit last year by $320 billion, this year going to reduce it by $1.7 trillion dollars, trillion dollars.

Clip: When you look at inflation, when we look at where we are economically, and we are in a strong, we are stronger economically than we have been in history. When you look at the unemployment numbers at 3.6%, when you look at the jobs numbers, more than 8.7 million of new jobs created, that is important. But we understand that gas prices are high and we understand that food costs are high. And that is because of a once in a generation pandemic and also Putin's war. And that's just the facts.

Cordero: So what's the truth? Are we growing faster and stronger than ever, or is our economy in a downward spiral? Today Stephen Moore, a distinguished fellow in economics at Heritage, will explain. Our conversation after this short break.

Cordero: Steve Moore, thank you so much for joining us.

Stephen Moore: Hi, Michelle. Great to be with you.

Cordero: Okay. So we know what we're seeing at the pump and at the grocery store, we're feeling the pain. So why is the Biden administration saying the economy has never been better? What are they looking at?

Moore: Well, I think first of all, this really suggests that the people in the White House are just out of touch with what's going on in real America. We've always talked about Washington being a bubble, where politicians of both side of the aisle are just not in touch with what's happening in main street America. And this is a really a picture perfect example of that, where it's laughable and it's actually insulting for the Biden administration to tell people who are seeing their incomes being ravaged by the highest inflation rate in 40 years.

Moore: You see there was a study that came out recently that a lot of families are really having to cut back and even the essentials that they buy because their incomes are falling relative to the price of everything from gasoline to buying milk and all the other things that people have to buy, rent.

Moore: And so it's not a good economy. 82% of Americans, according to New York Times poll, and they're hardly on the right, Americans say the country's headed in the wrong direction. And it is. It is headed in the wrong direction. We've got the high gas prices. We have a situation now where I believe we're in a, what I call a soft recession, where the last two quarters have been negative, now only a little bit negative, but still that's officially in a recession.

Moore: And the real question now, I think going forward, Michelle, is whether we're going to have a crash landing here. Whether we're going to be able to glide out of this and we can talk about that, but I'm worried.

Cordero: So another thing we've heard from Joe Biden is that Americans have record savings. Where's he getting that? Is that true?

Moore: Yeah. I'm working on a paper right now, that's why I was laughing. About the things, the multiple things that Biden has said about the economy that are not true. And that's one of the ones I don't even understand.

Moore: Sometimes you can cherry pick data and say, oh, look, this shows, but we've just lived through a stock market crash where the economy's lost $8 trillion in savings. So it's really delusional to say Americans have record high savings when every day that goes by, people are losing their lifetime savings. I mean, my God, my wife and I just looked at our 401k plan and I'm not rich, we lost a couple hundred thousand dollars just in the last six months of our lifetime savings because of the crash in the market.

Moore: And then the fact is that I was looking at credit card data, Americans aren't saving, they're dis-saving, they're running up their credit card so they can pay their bills. So that is another one that it just doesn't comport with reality.

Cordero: So let's talk about the job market. I'm just going to kind of run through some of these indicators. The left claims that the job market is growing. Is that true?

Moore: Look, the job market is good right now. It is good. And there are jobs out there. So my advice to people, if you're been sitting on the sideline for two years, like a lot of people have throughout COVID, now would be a good time to get a job while they're still available. Job growth is definitely slowing. And so over the last three months, we've seen there's fewer Americans working today than there were three months ago.

Moore: And I think we're all a little puzzled. Even the economics team here at Heritage, we have a lot of discussions about why is this happening? Why aren't Americans filling the jobs that are out there? And I do think the government benefits is a big part of this, that we're paying people not to work.

Moore: And one of the things, I mean, the people regulars here at Heritage know that Heritage played such a big role in the 1990s on the historic welfare reforms, where we required people to work to get benefits. We all believe in a safety net, but you have to either be working or looking for a job or getting training.

Moore: And people should realize that under Obama, then especially so under Biden, we've eviscerated all of those. Almost all of the work requirements are gone. And so you've got people who can get rental assistance, food stamps, free healthcare, $300 a week per child benefits, unemployment benefits, all of these things. And they add up to, and by the way, this is all tax free, without working an hour, you can make 70, $75,000 a year. So we have to get back to the idea of work fair.

Cordero: So you're saying, going back to the question that the job market is growing, but that's due to the circumstances left over from the pandemic.

Moore: Yeah, exactly. We're still a little bit below where we were in 2019. We haven't still fully recovered.

Moore: And the other part of this, Michelle, that's really interesting that we've been doing a lot of work on here at Heritage, is looking at the difference between what's happening in the red states and the blue states. So Republican governors handled COVID much, much better than the blue states did. They kept their schools open. They allowed their businesses where possible to stay open, whereas the blue states just shut down.

Moore: And so even to this day, the red states have lower unemployment rates. They have healthier businesses. And so it is also a kind of a tale of two countries. The job market is pretty good in the red states and in the blue states, you still have a lot higher unemployment.

Cordero: Okay. Another indicator is the housing market. Fox Business recently reported that home sale cancellations hit its highest rate since the start of the pandemic. What does that tell us?

Moore: I'm worried about housing because I think we all remember what happened in 2007 and 2008 when we had the financial collapse that was led by the bursting of the housing bubble. And Lord, I don't want to see that again. I mean, that was just a total collapse of the US economy.

Moore: I am worried about a bubble in the housing market. You've got record low affordability, so people can't afford the prices of the houses, and then you have rising mortgage rates. So just to give you an example, now, mortgage rates actually have come down a little bit in the last few weeks, thank goodness. They hit 6%. Now they're at about 5.7, but they were at 3%. So let's just use the single example from three to 6% on a mortgage rate, you have a 30 year mortgage and a $500,000 home, which is about the median house value today. You're going to pay an extra 150 to $200,000 in interest payments over the life of that mortgage. So it's making housing even more expensive and I do think you're going to see a slow down.

Moore: Now, look, we've had a, the housing market's been through the roof over the last five years, so it's got to come down. I just hope it doesn't crash.

Cordero: All right. And then one more thing that I'm seeing the left is actually admitting that inflation is going up, but I see them following it up with, but so are wages. Does that matter?

Moore: Sure. I mean, what's killing the economy and killing families right now is that for roughly the last year or 14 months or so, inflation is up about 8% and wages are up about 5%. So that means families in real terms are 3% poor than they were when Biden came into office. And I lived through this in 1970s. So, people would get eight or 9% pay raises and yet inflation was running at 12%, so they were actually losing money. And that's the phenomenon you're seeing right now.

Cordero: So the left is spinning that then by acting like wages are up is a good thing. Forget about the fact that inflation is up.

Moore: Yeah. Because we want to look at the purchasing power of your wages. And so that's way down. And so we've got to get the inflation rate down. I mean, I want to make this point crystal clear, until we get this inflation rate down, inflation like a cancer, it just kills an economy. You see that throughout American history, you see it in other countries. So we got to, job number one is get that inflation rate down to at least, right now we're at eight and a half percent, we got to get down to no more than four and then get it back down to about the 2% range you want it at.

Moore: And so the Fed has been way behind the curve on this. But another point we've been making at Heritage to all the members of Congress and the people in the policy making positions is the match that lit the forest fire of this high inflation was the runaway spending that happened. And it was the last year of Trump and the first year and a half of Biden where we spent three and a half trillion dollars we didn't have.

Moore: And my only surprise that any economists are even surprised that, of course that's going to lead to inflation when you just flood the zone with all of this cheap money, then all of a sudden it's, as Milton Friedman taught us, it's too many dollars in the economy chasing too few goods. So you've got to, Fed has to start pulling back that money.

Moore: And then the other thing we're talking a lot at Heritage about to, especially the Republicans because they will take Congress, is now you need also a pro growth agenda of how do we get an increase in the supply of goods and services? Well, you're not going to give that by raising taxes and raising regulations. And so we need a pro America energy policy to, as Trump had, we need to be cutting taxes and we need to get government spending under control.

Cordero: All right, Steve, this is your wheelhouse. You're a rockstar when it comes to these issues.

Cordero: In conclusion, we're feeling pain at the pump, feeling pain at the grocery store. The left is telling us that's not true, the economy's great. In a nutshell, what is the state of the economy right now? And are we heading into a recession or not?

Moore: I would use the word precarious. We're in a really dangerous spot right now. We have to turn things around. And Michelle, something that really worries me, that's keeping me up at night now, is as you and I speak, unfortunately, you've got Chuck Schumer now negotiating with Joe Manchin, who was my man of the year. But if he makes a deal with Manchin, I mean with Schumer, for another version of this Build Back Better, you're talking about potentially another trillion dollars of spending and taxes, that would be catastrophic. I mean, I can't imagine they would do something that damaging the economy. We need to be cutting spending and taxes and the Democrats want to do the exact opposite. So that will be our big focus as we've got to stop this bill from happening.

Moore: The Democrats have 50 votes in the Senate, so we have to, hopefully Kristin Sinema or maybe Joe Manchin will come to their senses because if they pass that bill, we'll have a severe recession. That's how dangerous that bill is.

Cordero: Steve, thank you so much for your time and your clarification on these issues.

Moore: Okay. Thank you, Michelle. Have a great week.

The Washington Post,"Sat, 13 Apr 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDI0LzA0LzEzL2JpZGVuLWluZmxhdGlvbi1wb2xpdGljYWwtYW5hbHlzaXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Washington Post,"President Biden has a story he wants to tell voters about the economy, one of consistent job growth over the course of his presidency and of a pandemic recovery that has led the world. Inflation keeps getting in the way. Last week’s inflation report showed consumer prices rising 3.5 percent from March 2023 to March 2024. This continued a string of surprises this year, suggesting a resurgence in inflation after signs had pointed in the other direction.

Biden administration officials have noted that the inflation rate has fallen since its earlier peak, but the latest numbers show it has not fully cooled. For now, it is moving in the wrong direction and remains above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2 percent.

Despite unemployment at a half-century low, the president’s economic job approval is net negative by a significant margin. The RealClearPolitics average shows that he is net negative by 18 percentage points on his handling of the economy and by 27 percentage points on how he’s dealt with inflation.

Political strategists in both parties have reported that voters repeatedly point to higher prices as a source of their unhappiness about the state of the country. The cost of everyday items — gasoline, food, housing — hits them constantly.

It’s hard to persuade voters to look on the sunny side when they are feeling the squeeze of higher prices on their household budgets. Voters’ common refrain is summed up as: Things cost too much.

Gasoline prices are rising once again, a typical occurrence as summer approaches. Although they are below their peak during the Biden presidency, they are significantly higher than when he took office. In early 2021, average gas price was $2.42. Today it is about $3.50, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency.

Food prices are taking another bite out of household incomes. From 2019 to 2023, food prices rose by 25 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Food costs accounted for 11.3 percent of disposable income in 2022, according to the most recent USDA analysis. That is the highest it has been since 1991, when families spent 11.4 percent of disposable income on food.

A dozen eggs now cost, on average, about $2.99, according to one indicator. That compares to an inflation-adjusted $2.09 per dozen in 2020.

Higher interest rates have meant more costly home mortgages. Mortgage rates began to ease but that has stalled or even begun to reverse. The Wall Street Journal carried a story on Friday that looked at the impact on middle-income families. The headline read: “Stay Put or Pay Up: Home Buyers Lose Hope for Lower Rates.”

The story said that, in March, a median-income family could afford a house costing no more than $416,000, given current interest rates and assuming a down payment of 20 percent. Three years ago, when mortgage rates were lower, that family could have bought a house valued at $561,000.

Other unexpected and unavoidable costs are hitting family pocketbooks. Car insurance is one example, with rates up 22.2 percent in the past year, the biggest increase since 1976. In Nevada, a presidential battleground state, auto insurance rates were up 38 percent over the previous year, according to a CNN report.

My colleague Heather Long posted on X earlier this year that, as of February, household repair costs had risen 18 percent over the previous year and nonprescription drugs were up 9 percent. Both, she noted on the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, were the highest such increases ever recorded.

Biden issued a statement last week after the March consumer price index report. He stressed that inflation had declined by more than 60 percent from its peak but said, “We have more to do to lower costs for hard-working families.” He added, “Fighting inflation remains my top economic priority.”

But presidents have few weapons in the fight against inflation. Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard University and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration, said 90 percent of controlling inflation is the job of the Federal Reserve. “The White House mostly has to figure out the best message to get through it, without a lot of tools to change the reality,” he said.

Biden has pushed policies aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs and he has gone after junk fees that companies add to things like airline tickets, car rentals and event tickets. He announced initiatives to provide assistance for home buyers in his State of the Union address, but they are going nowhere.

Twice this past week, the administration announced actions to reduce student debt, efforts aimed to shore up support among younger voters. But those policies affect the pocketbooks only of those who qualify while adding future costs to the government. And they have drawn criticism for helping some who went to college at the expense of others who never went to college.

The Fed would cut interest rates for two reasons — to head off a recession if one was looming or because inflation had eased enough to give officials confidence that lower rates would not reignite another inflationary round. Neither condition exists right now.

There is no recession on the horizon, after a long period of predictions that interest rate hikes could or would bring about a recession. And now prices are rising more rapidly than expected.

Economists think it’s doubtful there will be a rate cut in June, as had been assumed a few months ago. A reduction in rates in September, though perhaps warranted economically by then, could be too close to the election, leaving Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell open to criticism that the Fed was acting to help Biden politically.

The 2024 election will be fought over more than economic issues. The biggest political story of the past week was the decision by the Arizona Supreme Court to resurrect an 1864 law that bans abortions except in the case of a danger to the life of the mother and that imposes penalties on those who provide abortions.

Advertisement

The decision will ensure that abortion will be a key issue in one of the most important battlegrounds in November, with the likelihood of an abortion referendum on the ballot. Vice President Harris, who has led the administration’s messaging on abortion for the past two years, flew to Arizona on Friday to highlight the state court action.

Biden has also made clear he will continue to focus on former president Donald Trump as a threat to democracy. Trump has said a second term would be an opportunity for retribution against his adversaries, and he has never retreated from his false claim that the 2020 election was stolen.

In the 2022 midterm elections, pre-election polls suggested that inflation and the economy were the biggest issues on the minds of voters, which led to predictions of sweeping Republican gains.

In the end, however, abortion and threats to democracy combined to motivate Democratic voters. Republicans came out of the midterms disappointed, gaining only a tiny majority in the House, failing to take control of the Senate and losing several contested elections for governor.","(3, 'inflation')"
138,Why Biden’s strong economy feels so bad to most Americans - CNN,Why Biden’s strong economy feels so bad to most Americans  CNN,"Thu, 07 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wOS8wNy9idXNpbmVzcy91cy1lY29ub215LWJpZGVuLWFwcHJvdmFsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAUVodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIzLzA5LzA3L2J1c2luZXNzL3VzLWVjb25vbXktYmlkZW4tYXBwcm92YWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,CNN,"New York CNN —

What’s the biggest problem with the US economy right now? The vibes are off.

By almost any objective measure, Americans are doing much better economically than they were nearly three years ago, when President Joe Biden took office. Still, a majority — 58% — say Biden’s policies have made economic conditions worse, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS.

That’s up from 50% a year ago.

But the grim outlook is at odds with the hard data, which reveal an economy bursting with optimism.

“Has the economy improved under Joe Biden? There’s literally no question,” said Justin Wolfers, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan.

In January 2021, the start of Biden’s term, “everything sucked,” according to Wolfers. Unemployment was at 6.3% and the economy had yet to rebound from the shock of Covid-19. Wolfers described that time as “one of the worst economic moments of my life.”

Two and a half years later, the US economy is in a much healthier spot.

Unemployment has been hovering near its lowest level in a half-century — roughly 3.5% — for the past 18 months. August marked the 32nd consecutive month of job growth. Real wages (meaning adjusted for inflation) are rising. That’s helped everyone feel confident about continuing to spend money, which keeps the US economic engine humming.

Put another way: People are spending like they’re in a good mood, even if they say they’re not.

“There’s this disjunction between reality and perception that’s as large as I’ve ever seen in my career,” Wolfers told CNN. “If you’d fallen asleep in 2019 and woke up in 2023, you would discover pretty much the sort of economy you would have expected.”

So, why the sour mood?

In short: Inflation, housing and bitter national politics.

How the economy is thriving

Economists are practically stumbling over themselves to revise their growth forecasts higher. Many banks are drastically rolling back or even reversing their expectations for a 2023 recession.

On Wednesday, S&P Global Market Intelligence raised its third-quarter GDP estimate by nearly two percentage points to an annualized rate of 4%, citing surprisingly strong retail sales data. It moved its annual estimate up slightly to a historically strong 2.3%.

An even sunnier outlook comes from the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model, which currently expects third-quarter GDP growth at a whopping annualized rate of 5.6%.

The economy is “growing much stronger than we anticipated,” Morgan Stanley economists recently told clients in a research report. The bank now expects GDP for the year to clock in at a 1.9% pace — nearly double its previous projection.

Inflation hangover

Sharply higher prices in 2021 and 2022 marked a painful economic moment for households around the world. In the United States, inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. The euro zone hit 10.6%, while the UK topped 11%.

Inflation has dramatically improved. The United States hit 3.2% in July, according to the latest Consumer Price Index. (The euro zone hit 5.3% in August, while the UK is at 6.8%.)

That means prices overall are still about 18% higher today than they were in late 2019, before the pandemic, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Despite all of that, real personal consumption expenditures are still growing at a strong pace, said Carola Binder, associate professor of economics at Haverford College. “So it seems that ‘bad vibes’ are not leading to a lot of precautionary saving.”

Gas prices on the rise

Gas prices, which are notoriously volatile, tend to feel like a slap in the face because they are unavoidable — even if you don’t drive, you see the prices on display outside every gas station.

Throughout 2022, gas prices were especially hard to predict as the Russian invasion of Ukraine jolted global commodities markets.

Earlier this summer, US drivers were enjoying big savings on gas compared with 2022. But by late August — around the time the CNN poll was conducted — prices had climbed back up to their highest level in months, just shy of $4 a gallon on average.

Unaffordable housing

The economy feels extra crummy for people looking to buy a home.

Housing affordability is at its lowest point in decades, with mortgage rates climbing above 7% to their highest level in more than 20 years. When Biden took office, mortgage rates were at a record low of 2.65%.

The Fed is partly to blame. Eleven interest rate hikes over the past year and a half have helped push mortgage rates higher, faster.

The median US home price has risen to $416,100 from $258,000 in 2019.

But the affordability issue isn’t just because of higher financing costs. It’s also because of historically low inventory, thanks to a pandemic-era buying spree combined with a lingering shortage rooted in the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis.

The partisan gap

CNN’s latest poll shows that Republicans and Democrats are both souring on President Biden’s handling of the economy.

Only 2% of Republicans and 48% of Democrats said economic conditions had improved under Biden. Nearly a quarter of Democrats said Biden’s policies have worsened economic conditions. Ninety-one percent of Republicans agreed.

“People are no longer telling us how they feel about the economy — really, they’re telling us how they feel about the president,” Wolfers said.

Either way, that poses a political problem for President Biden, whose re-election campaign has sought to highlight the economy’s strengths.

“You can’t jawbone people into feeling better,” said former White House senior adviser David Axelrod on CNN This Morning. “I think the president has to find a way to talk about the things that he’s done in a context other than kind of asking for a report card from the American people.”

139,Biden and Trump ask voters if they're 'better off' than they were 4 years ago. It's complicated - The Associated Press,Biden and Trump ask voters if they're 'better off' than they were 4 years ago. It's complicated  The Associated Press,"Thu, 21 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2JpZGVuLXRydW1wLXZvdGVycy1wYW5kZW1pYy1lcmEtZWNvbm9teS1pbmZsYXRpb24tNTk3ZjRmMmYyYjJlMzJkODkzMzgwMmUzN2VmNjY5MTPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Associated Press,"HOUSTON (AP) — “Are you better off today than you were four years ago?” Rarely have voters’ answers to that question been so complicated.

Former President Donald Trump asked the time-tested question of his supporters in all-caps Monday on his Truth Social platform. President Joe Biden did the same three times over this week during a trio of Texas fundraisers as he closed out a swing through the southwest.

Each candidate is hoping the answer skews in his favor — but the verdict may well hinge on whether people are reflecting back on the COVID-19 pandemic, the state of their pocketbooks or some broader sense of well-being.

Four years ago, the country was in the throes of a nationwide shutdown due to the coronavirus, with surging joblessness and a cratering stock market. Now the presumptive Democratic and Republican nominees are hurtling toward a rematch in which the virus for most Americans is but a traumatic memory, markets are up and unemployment is at or near record lows.

If the handling of the once-in-a-century outbreak defined the 2020 presidential race, it appears that voters have other things on their minds as they consider their choices in 2024.

“Speaking of Donald Trump, just a few days ago, he asked the famous question at one of his rallies: Are you better off today than you were four years ago?” Biden told donors this week. “Well Donald, I’m glad you asked that question, man, because I hope everyone in the country takes a moment to think back when it was like in March of 2020.”

From there, Biden plunged into a recitation of dark moments from the early days of the pandemic, when hospital emergency rooms were overcrowded, first responders were risking their lives to care for the sick and some nurses resorted to wearing trash bags due to the scarcity of personal protective equipment.

Trump, for his part, tosses out a wider net in reflecting on the American psyche.

“Under the Trump administration, you were better off, your family was better off, your neighbors were better off, your communities were better off, and our country was far, far, far better off; that’s for sure,” he said at a rally this month. “America was stronger and tougher and richer and safer and more confident.”

“You have wars that never would have taken place,” Trump claimed. “Russia would have never attacked Ukraine. Israel would have never been attacked. You wouldn’t have had inflation.”

The “are you better off” prompt traces its roots to the 1980 presidential race, when Ronald Reagan skewered then-incumbent President Jimmy Carter during a televised debate and catapulted himself to the White House.

In a February AP-NORC poll, just 24% of Americans said they were better off than they were when Biden became president, while 41% said they were worse off and 34% said neither. Majorities also said the country as a whole and the national economy were worse off than when Biden became president.

Biden aides contend that the question — like other polling barometers of presidential performance — has been overtaken by partisanship. They say their internal surveys have shown that voters tend to block out the pandemic from their memories unless reminded of it, and that when asked about Trump they tend to think of the pre-pandemic years rather than 2020.

Insisting that they are focused on meeting voters where they are, Biden’s team had not intended to put the Reagan question to voters. But once Trump chimed in, Biden was quick with a rejoinder.

Speaking to well-heeled Texas donors Biden reminded his audience that four years ago, morgues were being set up outside of hospitals because so many people were dying, unemployment shot up, the stock market sank and grocery store shelves were bare. Trump, at the time, was disregarding the advice of his public health experts and pushing unproven treatments on the public.

“Remember when he said inject bleach?” Biden asked in Houston. After some chuckles, Biden continued: “I think he must’ve done it.”

Concurrently, Biden’s team released an ad highlighting some of Trump’s most controversial moments from 2020, including the bleach comment, his self-assessment that he’d rate his response to the pandemic a “10” and his reflection on virus deaths that “it is what it is.”

Trump’s national press secretary Karoline Leavitt pushed back at Biden’s claims in a statement.

“Joe Biden and his media allies can cherry-pick numbers from the worst of the COVID crisis all they want, but Americans know Biden has been a disaster and they were far better off under President Trump, which is why President Trump continues to crush Biden in the polls,” she said.

Trump earned abysmal marks from voters four years ago for his handling of the pandemic, which cost him the White House, and more than 1.1 million people in the U.S. would go on to die from COVID-19. But the majority of those deaths occurred during Biden’s presidency as he struggled to contain new variants and to drive up vaccination rates for the life-saving shots that were developed during Trump’s term.

The “better-off” answer, then, can go in multiple directions.

“Today, the answer is unequivocally ‘it depends,’” said Republican strategist Alex Conant. “The pandemic is over, but nobody blames Trump for causing the pandemic or credits him with the vaccines that ended it. The economy is doing well, but only after a bout of historic inflation that people are still upset about. For most voters, the answer isn’t clear — which is why the outcome of the election itself is unclear this far out.”

He added: “I don’t think any voters want to go back to the dark days of 2020, but judging by the poll numbers, most voters don’t like 2024 very much either.”

In some ways, many voters did feel better off during the pandemic — because of massive dollops of government aid. Their bank accounts grew dramatically in size, while the closures tied to the coronavirus kept inflation and interest rates extremely low. Government borrowing is what paid for those perceived gains, as budget deficits totaled $3.1 trillion in 2020 and nearly $2.8 trillion in 2021, according to the Office of Management and Budget.

Average annual incomes spiked with each of the three rounds of pandemic aid. In March 2021, the bottom 50% of U.S. earners saw their average disposable income after inflation jump to $46,000 as they received money from Biden’s coronavirus relief, according to economists at The University of California, Berkeley. Average disposable income has since dipped to $26,100 in March 2023. As a result, people may feel worse off, even though their incomes are actually higher than they were before the pandemic broke out in early 2020.

Biden, though, is trying to put a forward-looking slant on the backward-looking question, as he aims to keep the contrast with Trump central to his reelection campaign.

“The problem isn’t just going back to where Trump had the country. It’s where he wants to take us now,” he told donors.

He concluded: “Folks, it’s not about me. It’s about him.”

This charticle preemptively assesses the state of the U.S. economy by looking at some of the key indicators of aggregate economic health. Overall, the data suggest that the U.S. economy is strong and poised to continue growing.

First, let’s look at scarring, or the permanent damage to the economy caused by recessions. The economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has been rocky at times, but 3.5 years after the official end of the recession, the U.S. economy accomplished a remarkable feat: It completely avoided scarring (which economists also call hysteresis).

By contrast, the Great Recession of 2007–2009 caused lasting damage to the U.S. economy. Figure 1 shows how the U.S. economy contracted to well below levels forecasted by the Congressional Budget Office before the recession and stayed depressed for the length of the recovery. (See Figure 1.)

Figure 1

Meanwhile, the post-pandemic U.S. economy has now caught up to—and exceeded—CBO projections of Gross Domestic Product from before the COVID-19 recession. (See Figure 2.)

Figure 2

Scarring can be particularly harmful for young workers who are looking for employment for the first time. Research shows that these workers face long-lasting negative impacts from graduating into a poor labor market. Even 10 years later, these workers have lower wages, higher chances of unemployment, and worse health outcomes than their peers. So, it’s especially encouraging that young U.S. workers have fared well in the post-pandemic economic recovery: Unemployment for 16- to 24-year-olds is at its lowest level in decades. (See Figure 3.)

Figure 3

Moreover, the Atlanta Federal Reserve finds that these same workers saw significant wage increases after the pandemic. Strong wage growth for these workers suggests they have avoided the labor market scarring that usually impacts young workers after a recession. (See Figure 4.)

Figure 4

These wage gains are primarily attributable to a tight U.S. labor market that has pulled more workers into the labor market. Prime-age women’s labor force participation rates are at historic highs, for example. Additionally, the gap in unemployment between White and Black workers is at its lowest point since both rates have been measured. (See Figure 5.)

Figure 5

Much of this success can be attributed to the strength of consumption in the U.S. economy. Thanks in large part to aggressive fiscal policy during the pandemic, Americans emerged from lockdown with money to spend—and they are spending it. Consumption should remain strong as wage growth is now outpacing inflation for most workers. (See Figure 6.)

Figure 6

According to the New York Federal Reserve, consumer debt also remains low by historical standards. Although credit card delinquency has crept up lately, it is within normal levels historically, and delinquencies for other types of debt are at extremely low levels. (See Figure 7.)

Figure 7

Taken together, the aggregate data paints the picture of a strong economy, with relatively few threats on the horizon. After months of erroneous recession speculation over the past couple of years, the indicators clearly show that the state of the U.S. economy is strong.","(0, 'GDP')"

The summer of 2022 is a season of deepening and widespread discontent, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. The survey finds the public’s outlook on the state of the country the worst it’s been since 2009, while its view on the economy is the worst since 2011. And nearly 7 in 10 say President Joe Biden hasn’t paid enough attention to the nation’s most pressing problems.

Biden’s approval rating in the poll stands at 38%, with 62% disapproving. His approval ratings for handling the economy (30%) and inflation (25%) are notably lower. Rising costs are a primary economic pressure for most Americans: 75% call inflation and the cost of living the most important economic problem facing their family. Last summer, that figure stood at 43%.

With midterm elections approaching, the poll finds no indication that Biden’s standing with the public is improving – and among some critical constituencies, it is worsening. Among Democrats, for example, Biden’s approval numbers have softened by 13 points since the spring (from 86% in a late April through early May poll to 73% now), while his numbers among independents and Republicans have held about even. Biden’s approval rating among Democrats for handling the economy is also on the decline (62% approve, down from 71% this spring). And on inflation, it is barely above water (51% of Democrats approve, 47% disapprove).

Among people of color, 45% now approve of Biden’s overall performance, down from 54% in the spring. That decline includes a 6-point dip among Black adults and a 9-point decline among Hispanic adults. Biden’s approval ratings for handling the economy and inflation now break negative among Black adults, who have been among the President’s strongest backers (47% approve and 52% disapprove on the economy, while 34% approve and 65% disapprove on inflation).

Few Americans who approve of Biden’s overall performance say they do so strongly. Overall, just 12% strongly approve of the way Biden is handling the presidency compared with 43% who say they strongly disapprove of his work. Only 28% of Democrats strongly approve, while among Republicans, strong disapproval is nearly universal at 84%.

The public’s perceptions of the economy and of how things are going in the country overall are deeply negative and worsening. Since the spring, the share saying things are going badly for the country has climbed 11 points to 79%, the highest since February 2009, and shy of the all-time worst reached in November 2008 by just four points. That shift comes largely among Democrats. Just 38% of Democrats now say things are going well in the country, down from 61% this spring. Likewise, there’s been a steep drop among people of color, from 41% saying things were going well in the spring to 27% now.

Only 18% of Americans describe the nation’s economy as in good shape, while 82% say economic conditions are poor. About 4 in 10 (41%) describe the economy as “very poor,” up 11 points since the spring and nearly doubled since December. As some economists warn of a looming recession, most Americans think the country is already there. The poll finds 64% of Americans feel the economy is currently in a recession, higher than the shares who said so just ahead of the Great Recession (46% felt that way in October 2007) and a recession that began in 2001 (44% said the country was already in a recession in February ’01). Majorities across parties say the country is already in a recession, including 56% of Democrats, 63% of independents and 76% of Republicans.

Asked to name the biggest economic problem facing their family today, 75% call out an issue related to the cost of living or inflation, including 38% who mentioned inflation and rising costs generally, 29% who mention gas prices, and 18% who mention the cost of food. All of those figures have increased sharply since last summer. One poll participant said, “Prices on everything just keeps getting higher and higher. is it going to stop?” Another said, “I work 40+ hours and can barely afford to survive. With the price of gas and price of food so high, I don’t see how anyone can have extra money to do anything other than work.” And a third participant said, “Inflation causes so much pain with everything we buy and everything we do.”

While the public’s attention has shifted sharply to inflation, few think the President’s focus has followed. In the poll, 68% say Biden has not paid enough attention to the country’s most important problems, up from 58% who said so last November. That outpaces the previous high in CNN polling saying a President’s attention has been misplaced (59% saying Donald Trump hadn’t paid attention to the most important problems in late summer 2017).

On this question too, Biden is losing ground among his core support groups. Among Democrats, 57% say he has the right priorities, down nearly 20 points from 75% last fall. Among people of color, just 35% say he has the right priorities, and among those younger than 35, only 23% say the President has the right focus.

The poll finds Biden’s approval ratings for handling immigration (39%) and the situation in Ukraine (46%) outperforming those for economic issues, but majorities disapprove on both issues.

The survey also suggests both the President’s and vice president’s personal favorability has taken a hit. A year and a half ago, just before their inauguration, 59% held a favorable opinion of Biden and 51% had a favorable view of Kamala Harris. Now, those figures stand at 36% and 32% respectively. Meanwhile, the public’s view of first lady Jill Biden is mixed: 34% have a favorable opinion, 29% unfavorable and 37% are unsure how they feel about her.

The new CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS June 13 through July 13 among a random national sample of 1,459 adults initially reached by mail, and is the third survey CNN has conducted using this methodology. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.","(3, 'inflation')"

LAS VEGAS — Near the base of the Rainbow Mountains, Daniel Busby looks up longingly at his two-story “dream” townhouse, with the sliding glass door on its second floor, the balcony that wraps around the master bedroom, the five-minute walk from his kids’ elementary school. “I just fell in love,” said Busby, 33, doing a chef’s kiss and smacking his lips together. “And then we started doing the math.”

The gregarious fry cook has enjoyed the windfalls of pandemic economic recovery overseen by President Biden. The president’s stimulus plan gave lower-wage workers more leverage to demand higher pay from their employers, with those in the service sector — like Busby — seeing particularly robust gains.

He went from being unemployed and working part-time at $15 an hour during the pandemic to a full-time job at the Paris Hotel, mostly at the Martha Stewart franchise, earning $19 an hour preparing a risotto dish and, his favorite, the whole chicken dinner. Busby and his wife now make a combined salary of just under six figures — a previously unimaginable sum.

But the gains have not kept up with rising costs, and that has become a major issue for voters like him. When Biden took the oath of office in January 2021, the average monthly mortgage payment in Las Vegas was about $1,200, according to calculations by Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. That number, for new mortgages, has soared to $2,350 today due to rising interest rates and robust housing prices — the outer edge of what Busby was willing to spend.

By many measures, the U.S. economy is a great success story — recession fears have fallen, along with gas prices and the unemployment rate, while manufacturing construction is up along with nominal wages and the stock market. The United States has grown faster since covid-19 than any peer country. Gas prices, once averaging over $5 a gallon, are now approaching $3. The Federal Reserve projects three interest rate cuts in 2024 that could help buyers like Busby.

But the kitchen-table experience of Biden’s first term — a roller coaster of covid adjustment and international shocks — has meant that many voters have experienced the last few years as a time of relative economic hardship. Despite rising wages, voters as a group lost spending power during 2021 and 2022 and have only recently climbed out of the hole. And even though wages are now outpacing inflation, prices are still continuing to rise: The latest government report showed inflation up 3.4 percent relative to the year before, fueling the anxiety even amid positive economic indicators.

A broad and diverse cross-section of American voters say they are experiencing the Biden economy as a challenging time of rising prices and high interest rates, according to interviews with more than 80 voters in four parts of the country — Las Vegas, Milwaukee, Phoenix and rural Georgia — that will play a major role in choosing the next president.

Adjusted for inflation, the per capita disposable income of U.S. residents rose nearly 1 percent from October 2021 to October 2023, a period that excludes the extraordinary one-time stimulus payments when Biden arrived, according to calculation by Robert Shapiro, a Democratic economist who advised Bill Clinton as president. By comparison, per capita disposable income, after inflation, grew about 7 percent under Donald Trump, during the first 34 months of his presidency.

The good news for Democrats is that the growth in spending power has been picking up over the last year at 3.7 percent through November, potentially setting the stage for a banner 2024, when wages will continue to grow even as the rate of inflation continues to fall.

“If incomes continue to rise rapidly over the next year, people will accept it by the election, especially since Biden’s record on jobs and growth is so much stronger,” Shapiro predicts. “Biden can overcome the fact that his income record — the growth of income — will not be strong over the whole term.”

But that is not the nation’s present-day reality. Biden’s polling on the economy has fallen with consumer confidence since he got into office, only recently stabilizing as confidence has begun to rebound. Wages are up, but the sting of higher grocery, coffee and restaurant bills remain. The president is still looking for credit from the budding manufacturing renaissance brought about by recent bipartisan legislation, though relatively few projects have been announced or begun production yet.

White House advisers are optimistic that the American public will soon internalize the good news and give the president credit before November. His political advisers note that other presidents who won reelection, like Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama, overcame challenging first-term economic conditions.

“We’re seeing real progress,” said Jared Bernstein, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, in a statement. “We have more work to do as we execute President Biden’s agenda, a sharp contrast with congressional Republicans’ plans to cut taxes for the wealthy and big corporations while raising health care and prescription drug costs for hard-working American families.”

People like Busby, who voted twice for Obama before sitting out the 2016 and 2020 elections, are not sure they will vote for Biden in 2024 — indecision that could tip the scale in a narrowly divided country. He has chosen, for the moment, to stay with his wife and two daughters, ages 10 and 6, in their 1,100-square-foot Vegas apartment, where the rent recently jumped from $1,100 to $1,600 a month.

After touring more than 30 houses, relentlessly monitoring Zillow and Redfin, and investigating all the first-time home buyer programs they could find, they have put their dream on hold.

“We work full-time hours, but we still can’t afford things. You think, ‘I work full time. I should be able to afford a house,'” he said. “I don’t want to come home one day and then realize I have to pack up and leave. It’s that sense of stability we’re missing.”

‘It’s really hard to keep up’

Milwaukee

Ceree Huley, 75, looked around Gee’s Clippers, the Black-owned Milwaukee barber shop where he works. “This place on a Thursday would be full of people,” he said of the those years before the pandemic.

“I don’t know what the reason they’re not here. … A lot of people are going to do it to themselves,” Huley said, referring to individual haircuts. “Or are they hiding from the costs of the prices that went up 10 dollars or 5 dollars? That could be a factor too.”

After 50 years as a barber, Huley has seen his own wages go up recently but is also paying more for rent after moving to a new place. Unlike some of his customers, he doesn’t blame Biden for his economic situation.

“I don’t know why it is, it seems like the economy gets worse,” said Zontayveon Mosley, a 21-year-old warehouse supervisor, who had come in for a cut. “For the average person who’s making $45,000 to $50,000 a year, it’s really hard to keep up.”

He said he would have backed Biden in 2020, but didn’t vote. He added that he will not vote for him this year and would consider supporting Trump, citing U.S. aid to other countries and the economy.

“Like giving billions of dollars to support others, when we have people that can’t eat, we have people that can’t pay bills, it’s just insane to me,” he said. “I feel like most Black people just lean towards Democrats. But I don’t know, entering the workforce and making money, I own a home. I’ve got to worry about interest rates and all of that. I feel like Trump is a better businessman.”

A stream of Black customers provided a nuanced take on the economy under Biden as they came in and out of the barber shop — decorated with basketball hoops, framed photos of athletes and the forest green Milwaukee Bucks logo sprawled across a gymnasium-style floor, razors buzzing in the background.

The economy here has largely tracked national trends, with weekly wages just below the national average and a nearly identical unemployment rate. William Robinson, a 47-year-old FedEx package handler, said he ends the month with less money than he starts, and it’s “kind of more survival than living” when he goes food shopping. He supported Obama both in 2008 and 2012, but said he will not vote for either Biden or Trump in 2024, describing them as “pretty much the same.”

“You can’t set prices. Inflation, you really don’t control none of that. Really it’s all the stuff that I can’t control that’s kind of making it difficult,” said Robinson, who added that he now needs to make adjustments between wants and needs. “Everybody got their little cheat foods, you know what I’m saying? Like the little cakes outside of the nutritious stuff. You just can’t enjoy it. And even with the stuff that’s nutritious, you got to prioritize, you know?”

Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School poll, said that voter views of the president and the economy “moved in tandem with objective economic indicators tolerably well up until the early 2000s.” Since then, partisanship has become more powerful and the link has begun to break.

In a recent survey, twice as many respondents said they’d heard about inflation compared with the unemployment rate. As for voters’ current perceptions of the economy, Franklin sees a combination of partisan bias and the effect of inflation on real disposable income, especially “coming after this sugar high of transfer payments in the pandemic years.”

It’s a trend that cuts both ways. Ken McClendon, a 51-year-old in the health-care-manufacturing business, said his wages have gone up but his economic situation was better before covid, given that “everything is more expensive now.”

Biden’s handling of the economy was a “little shaky,” he said, before adding, “You have to realize what he walked into.” If the election comes down to a choice between Biden and Trump?

Biden “all the way,” he said.

‘Who gets credit for a dumb idea?’

Dalton, Ga.

One of Biden’s legislative triumphs can be seen through the trees 80 miles north of Atlanta along Interstate 75, a gray, low-slung roof factory of Qcells North America.

The South Korean-owned plant expanded after the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, adding 510 jobs to the growing solar industry. The panels its workers make in a 12-hour shift can produce as much solar power annually as the Hoover Dam’s peak output.

But few at the Oakwood Cafe in nearby Dalton have noticed in this conservative corner of the state, represented by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R). Dalton Mayor David Pennington (R) dismissed the government support of solar panels as the pet project of politicians, embraced both by Vice President Harris, who visited the plant in April, and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R).

“Who gets credit for a dumb idea?” Pennington said, laughing. “When both sides are agreeing on something, it probably proves it is a stupid idea.”

Pennington says residents most often ask him what he’s doing to help address the falling test scores of the city’s students. Families tell him that their grocery bills have gone up in the last three years. Pennington said that the night before, after a governmental meeting, he and his wife went to Krystal, a regional fast food joint, and ordered burgers, fries and drinks for $23, a meal he remembers costing $12 five years ago.

At a nearby table, Eric Azua, a local Realtor and registered Republican, made the same point: He has benefited himself from the Qcells expansion. He said he has sold homes to workers who are able to afford more given higher wages, offering Azua better commissions. But he credits local officials for the new jobs, rather than the Biden administration. Like many others in the area, Azua plans to vote for Trump.

“He needs to be replaced,” he said of Biden.

In 2018, Trump’s steep tariffs on solar panels from China prompted Qcells to build the facility in Dalton. Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act — including a provision by Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) — provided tax credits for every stage of the solar manufacturing supply chain, incentivizing Qcells to expand.

Such expansions of U.S. manufacturing have been happening around the country in recent years, spurred by federal incentives supported by Biden. Monthly manufacturing construction spending rose from $77 million to $207 million between January 2021 and October 2023, a jump of 170 percent, according to census data. It’s progress that Biden has highlighted in his television ads this fall, talking about new manufacturing jobs, new green energy to lower power costs.

“For Joe Biden, it’s about restoring the sense of security working people deserve,” says one Biden spot that has run in Georgia.

The industrial park near the highway that cuts through Dalton has boomed since Qcells first opened there. Beside the first Qcells facility at the site, a second sleek, brightly lit warehouse has popped up, where workers are assembling commercial and residential solar panels with the help of automated machines.

“There are not other jobs similar in the area,” said Lisa Nash, general manager of the Qcells factory. “We can take high school students, people who have made other products, and if they have an aptitude, we can train them. And it’s upskilling.”

Other jobs have come downstream. Mary Sumner, who voted for Biden in 2020, recently started working for the local janitorial company that contracts with Qcells as an extra source of income aside from her job managing an apartment complex. She knows she is part of a minority in her family of 10 and hometown that would give any credit to Biden for anything positive, including the new source of money she receives.

“Four more years and there’s even better things to come,” Sumner said.

Jan Pourquoi, a Democrat and owner of a small Dalton carpet company, attended Harris’s visit to the site. When he looked around the room, he didn’t see anyone who lived in Dalton.

His neighbors and friends tell him they are worse off financially than they were under Trump and they believe Republicans are doing more to address immigration and drugs — or at least they seem to talk about it more. In the last local election, 9 percent of registered voters cast a ballot. In 2024, Pourquoi expects there won’t be any surge of voters supporting Biden, especially for the solar initiatives.

“There are more people aware of Qcells outside this area than in this area,” he said. “What it definitely will not do is change anything on the political dial.”

‘Everything has gone up in price’

Phoenix

Martha Isela Rodriguez remembers when she would go just once a week to buy her groceries at the Fry’s right around the corner from her house.

Now, she checks her mail daily to see the weekly ads with specials and coupons for grocery stores. El Rancho Market has deals on fruits and vegetables on Wednesdays and meat on Thursdays. On the weekend, Food City tends to have some good specials, too.

For Rodriguez, it has become the norm to visit three grocery stores a week — and even then, she’s still paying more than before.

Standing in the kitchen heating tortillas on a comal, a cast-iron skillet, Rodriguez recalled how she used to pay much less for groceries when Trump was president. Everything, from the chuletas de cerdo to the jalapeños she uses for her salsa, was cheaper. And that $380 electricity bill she just paid? It had never been so high, she remarked.

For her, all these higher costs spell trouble for Biden, who she voted for and knocked on doors to get elected in 2020. Her home county of Maricopa went for Trump in 2016 by under three percentage points and then backed Biden in 2020 by just over two percentage points. But she’s skeptical that Biden will win Arizona — or the 2024 election.

“Personally, I see it difficult for Biden to win. There’s already so many people who feel he hasn’t done anything, that the economy isn’t working,” Rodriguez, 48, said as she passed her 1-year-old granddaughter, Maria Daniela, an apple, mango and spinach baby food puree as a snack.

She was hearing it from her co-workers whom she had convinced to vote for Biden in 2020. Now, they either say they won’t vote this year or they’re considering backing Trump. They taunt her for pushing them to support Biden in 2020 — complaining to her about how bad inflation was under Biden and how he was letting in too many migrants and helping them when he wasn’t helping the undocumented immigrants already living here.

“They tell me things like, ‘Look at the gas. It hasn’t gone down at all since your Biden came into power.’ Your Biden, they tell me,” she said. “They say the same with a box of eggs or a gallon of milk. ‘Now that your Biden is around, the prices are up and the salaries don’t match it.’”

“And what can I say? Yes, it’s true,” she added. “Everything has gone up in price.”

Due to inflation, it cost an Arizona family over $2,700 a year more to purchase the same goods and services last August as it would have cost in August 2022, according to an analysis in September by the nonpartisan Common Sense Institute.

The sharpest increases came in distinct sectors, including gas prices, which rocketed higher in early 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine, and have since fallen back to 2021 levels. The pain of those increases was felt especially in suburban and rural areas, where people like Rodriguez drive long distances on a daily basis.

Rodriguez said she knew it wasn’t necessarily Biden’s fault that inflation remained an issue in Phoenix, as she’d heard of it being a challenge globally. But she said she wished he would project more confidence and stability like Obama, the politician whom she said she became a U.S. citizen just to vote for. In her eyes, she said, Obama was handed a terrible economy after George W. Bush’s administration and was able to turn it around.

“Biden just doesn’t have that magic, that energy to get things done,” she said.

In a matchup between Biden and Trump, Rodriguez said she’ll vote for Biden again. It won’t be because he’s done a good job, she said, but because of just how strongly she dislikes Trump.

She added, however, that she doesn’t plan to repeat her election-year summer of knocking on doors in the Phoenix heat to get other Latinos out to vote for Biden this time.","(4, 'national debt')"

While highlighting new and ongoing infrastructure investments across the country, President Joe Biden on Thursday continued to praise the recent GDP report that found the nation's economy grew at a 3.3% annual pace -- much more rapid than expected -- and he gave credit to Americans for an economy that has exceeded expectations.

""Thanks to the American people, America now has the strongest growth, the lowest inflation rate of any major economy in the world. It's because of you,"" he said at an event in Superior, Wisconsin.

The GDP report released Thursday found that in addition to the economy growing at an unexpectedly brisk pace, inflation has eased -- showing Americans' willingness to spend freely in the face of high interest rates and price levels. The latest data marked the sixth straight quarter where the GDP had grown at an annual pace of 2% or more.

Biden took a victory lap for overcoming predictions that a recession would happen since he came into office and the constant headlines warning one was around the corner. With a chuckle, he read the optimistic headlines on the strong fourth quarter.

""Here's this morning's headlines from the Wall Street Journal and other papers: 'U.S. shatters expectations.' Second headline: 'The U.S. economy boomed in 2023.' Third: 'U.S. economy grew at a shocking pace.' I love the 'shocking pace' bit,"" Biden said. ""But my favorite is from the Wall Street Journal: 'What recession? Growth ended accelerating in 2023.'""

As Biden gears up for the general election, he also emphasized how Americans are finally starting to feel better about the state of the economy, which will be a key issue for voters in November. He credited his policies for reaching an auspicious point with the economy.

""Just last week, we saw the biggest jump in 30 years and how positive consumers are feeling about the economy. Things are finally beginning to sink in,"" he said. ""We passed a lot of really good legislation. We knew it was going to take time for it to begin to take hold, but it's taken hold now in turning the economy around.""

And while he touted his successes, Biden also criticized former President Donald Trump over his recent comments that the former president hoped the economy would crash on Biden's watch.

Earlier this month, Trump said in an interview with Lou Dobbs that he wanted the economy to crash in the next year because ""I don't want to be Herbert Hoover.""

Biden questioned, ""can you believe it?""

""Well, he said he's hoping ... it happens soon while I'm still president. That's what he's hoping for,"" Biden said.

Though progress is being made, Biden said, ""we obviously have more work to do, but we're making real progress.""","(0, 'GDP')"

President Biden has denied the damage his Bidenomics blueprint of reckless spending, anti-American energy policies, and sweeping regulations have caused for the economy and American households’ budgets. Chairman Fallon emphasized the need for transparency about how Bidenomics has damaged our fiscal and national security and what we must do instead to get the economy growing again.

Below are Subcommittee Chairman Fallon’s remarks as prepared for delivery.

Today’s hearing is an opportunity to discuss an issue every household in America is familiar with—the clear failure of “Bidenomics” and the crisis caused through the Biden Administration’s reckless spending.

Joe Biden likes to say that “Bidenomics is just another way of saying, ‘Restoring the American Dream.”

But just last week, the Consumer Price Index showed prices have risen 17.4% since Joe Biden took office. That means 26 months of consumers watching their paychecks disappear before their very eyes due to the rising cost of living.

Worse yet, mortgage rates have nearly doubled since Joe Biden took office, making it much harder for Americans to buy a new home.

That is not the American Dream.

Joe Biden likes to say that Bidenomics is about “building from the middle out and the bottom up.”

But those hurt most by the rising prices are low-income households and seniors relying on Social Security for their monthly retirement income.

Wage growth has fallen behind the pace of inflation in 20 of the past 22 months, and most Americans are now unable to pay for a surprise expense of $400 without going into debt.

That is not building from the middle out and the bottom up.

Joe Biden likes to remind us he promised not to raise taxes on anyone earning less than $400,000 a year. But as of June 2023, the average worker was paying an “inflation tax” of 13.5%—effectively a second federal income tax.

The truth is, Bidenomics has been a disaster, and the American people know it.

A recent poll found that 80 percent of Americans credit Joe Biden’s policies for the current state of the economy and 70 percent agreed that their incomes were not keeping pace with inflation.

Our current economic track is nothing short of unsustainable, yet the Biden Administration could not be less concerned.

In fact, Joe Biden considers the current environment a huge success—proudly taking credit for every failed business that couldn’t stay afloat under his crushing regulatory regime, or the parent forced to pay bills with a credit card and going into debt because their wages were not keeping pace with inflation.

According to Joe Biden, we’re supposed to believe that we’re actually better off than we were at the start of his administration. But the facts tell a very different story.

The pain households are experiencing can be tied directly back to disastrous policies pushed by this Administration.

In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency spending made sense—the country was thrown into a tailspin and we had to ensure that our entire economy did not capsize.

However, the Biden Administration plowed forward maintaining these “wartime” spending levels long after that spending was necessary. It’s been said, “Never let a good crisis go to waste,” and the Administration could not have taken this more literally.

From the “American Rescue Plan” to the “Inflation Reduction Act,” the Biden Administration has wasted no time throwing mind-boggling amounts of money at various crises of their choosing with seemingly no regard for the consequences.

The Biden Administration apparently doesn’t care if a gallon of milk costs $6, so long as they can force everyone to purchase an electric vehicle that costs more than the yearly median household income.

Decades ago, Republicans banded together through the “Contract with America” to bring about some of the most impactful economic reforms seen in generations.

By combining a series of targeted, fiscally conservative policies into one unified agenda, House Republicans paved the way for Americans everywhere to prosper.

We have already seen the blueprint for what works, and we can achieve that success again.

We have also seen the blueprint for what does not work, thanks to Bidenomics and the anti-growth policies of this Administration.

I thank our witnesses for appearing before the Committee today and I look forward to a thoughtful discussion.","(4, 'national debt')"

Funded by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the H2Hubs program will help form the foundation of a national clean hydrogen network vital to reducing emissions from some of the most energy-intensive sectors of our economy, including industrial and chemical processes and heavy-duty transportation. Today’s announcement will help ensure both producers and end users in the H2Hubs have the market certainty they need during the early years of production to unlock private investment and realize the full potential of clean hydrogen. Achieving commercial-scale clean hydrogen deployment is critical to creating good-paying jobs and new economic opportunities in communities across the nation while also enabling our long-term decarbonization objectives.

“Ensuring America is the global leader in the next generation of clean energy technologies requires all of us — government and industry — coming together to confront shared challenges, particularly lack of market certainty for clean hydrogen that too often delays progress,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “That’s why DOE is setting up a new initiative to help our private sector partners address bottlenecks and other project impediments — helping industry unlock the full potential of this incredibly versatile energy resource and supporting the long-term success of the H2hubs.”

Clean hydrogen — a versatile and flexible energy carrier that can be produced with low or zero carbon emissions — offers substantial economic benefits and will help create tens of thousands of new, good-paying jobs across the country, particularly in underserved and energy communities. According to DOE’s Pathways to Commercial Liftoff: Clean Hydrogen report, America’s growing hydrogen economy has the potential to add 100,000 net new direct and indirect jobs by 2030. By enabling the development of diverse, domestic clean energy pathways across multiple sectors of the economy, clean hydrogen will strengthen American energy independence and accelerate the American manufacturing boom that has already created over 800,000 jobs since President Biden took office.

Developing a hydrogen demand-side initiative is critical to ensuring the early commercial viability of a H2Hub given that demand formation for a new energy source typically lags creation of reliable supply. This new initiative will support the growth and sustainability of the H2Hubs program by providing the revenue certainty that hydrogen producers require to attract private sector investment. It will also help meet the needs of end users who often prefer the flexibility to purchase hydrogen on shorter-term contracts and require confidence in the long-term availability of clean hydrogen before making critical, long-term investments.

The NOI, which includes a Request for Information on the program’s design, will help DOE refine and validate its approach to provide demand-side support for the hubs to enter the clean hydrogen market and will identify the best approach to engaging and potentially involving private sector institutions in the organization, capitalization, and execution of the implementing entity’s mandate. To help inform the design of a demand-side support mechanism for the H2Hubs program, the NOI seeks public input on potential benefits and risks, operating models, governance structures, and equipped implementing partners. The NOI is also informed by DOE’s dialogue with the energy industry, clean energy investment firms, nonprofit entities, non-governmental organizations, and public response from the demand-side request for information issued in spring 2022 and from DOE’s Pathways to Commercial Liftoff Report on clean hydrogen. Based on demonstrated performance and experience gained with the H2Hubs demand-side support mechanism, DOE may consider similar mechanisms for other technologies and clean energy products in the future.

Funded by the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and managed by DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations with support from the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, the H2Hubs are a critical component of the Biden-Harris Administration’s deep commitment to invest in America’s workforce, jumpstart local economic growth, and create good-paying jobs while strengthening America’s role as a clean energy leader.

Later this year, the Biden-Harris Administration will announce the selection of six to 10 H2Hubs for a combined total funding of up to $7 billion in federal funding—one of the most historic clean energy investments in history and a cornerstone of President Biden’s vision to achieve carbon-free grid by 2035 and net-zero emissions by 2050. The proposed mechanism outlined in the NOI will help connect the H2Hubs to prospective purchasers — providing durable demand and sufficient customers for the Hubs while also supporting President Biden’s whole-of-government approach to building a strong clean hydrogen economy.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Americans give President Biden low marks on the economy. How bad are things? This quiz will help you calibrate your level of concern, and it will show you how your knowledge of economic reality stacks up against other Americans we asked and other Post readers. (We partnered with Gapminder, a Swedish nonprofit, to poll 600 people ages 18 to 65 about the economy. The sample was balanced to reflect U.S. demography.)

✓ Check Yourself Test your assumptions in The Post's editorial quiz, powered by Gapminder. 1 of 4 The economies of the Euro zone are 3 percent bigger today than they were before the coronavirus pandemic. How is the U.S. economy today* compared with before the pandemic? It’s 7% smaller It’s the same size It’s 7% bigger *As of the end of Q3 2023

Brisk consumer spending has made the U.S. economic recovery from the pandemic stronger than Europe’s. Large federal government aid in 2020 and 2021 boosted U.S. household spending and saving. On top of that, many Americans locked in rock-bottom mortgage rates when they were low, so they have not felt the sting of high interest rates as much as consumers in other countries. Strong wage growth and stock market gains have also fueled U.S. spending.

Even so, top-line numbers can mask economic challenges Americans face. Hasn’t inflation stung many households?

The average price for gas was about $2.40 when President Biden took office. The price reached an all-time high of $5 a gallon in June 2022 mainly because of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. But gas prices have fallen a lot since then and are now just over $3 a gallon.

Yet Americans buy far more than just gas. What’s the big picture?

3 of 4 Prices in the United States have risen about 20 percent since just before the coronavirus pandemic. How much have wages grown since then? Less than 1% Around 10% Around 20%

Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement

Inflation hit a 40-year high in the summer of 2022. Prices for almost everything were rising: food, cars, travel, appliances. Costs for many were rising faster than their pay. But that changed in 2023 as many workers saw large wage increases. The average worker’s pay has risen 20.5 percent since January 2020, outpacing the 19 percent rise in inflation over the same time frame. Many low-wage workers are doing even better.

These facts prompt a look at the state of American jobs.

4 of 4 Which president had the strongest job growth in his first term? Donald Trump Mr. Biden Barack Obama

This question is a bit unfair; presidents have only so much control over the economy, and the timing of presidential terms determines how the numbers look. (President Donald Trump saw more than 6 million jobs added in his first three years in office, but those gains disappeared in the pandemic. He ended his first term with millions of job losses.) Moreover, Mr. Biden’s first term isn’t done. But anyone who claims that this key indicator of economic health is off-track has not been paying attention to the country’s jobs bonanza, with record-low levels of unemployment and more than 14 million jobs added through December 2023.

Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement

The U.S. economy — and American workers — have been remarkably resilient. The Federal Reserve’s campaign against inflation has cooled price increases. Hiring remains robust. And growth recently accelerated. Americans are finally becoming more upbeat about the U.S. economy as gas and grocery prices stabilize and growth continues with no recession in sight. There are still people struggling, as food insecurity data and fast-growing credit card debt demonstrate. But jobs remain plentiful and unemployment has sat below 4 percent for the longest stretch in U.S. history since the Vietnam War era. Wages are now strongly outpacing inflation, especially for lower-wage workers, which is boosting spending and people’s confidence in the economy’s future.

Presidents generally get too much credit — or blame — for economic circumstances over which they have much less power than Americans imagine. Yet it is simply wrong to remember Mr. Trump’s term as an economic renaissance that contrasts with misery today. Mr. Biden deserves more credit, if only for staying out of the Fed’s way, something that Mr. Trump might not have done. All Americans should celebrate the “soft landing” the United States is enjoying.

Americans’ views of President Joe Biden’s job performance have ebbed since the start of the year, a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS finds. The public’s views of the national economy remain lackluster, with more than 4 in 10 saying they’re seriously concerned rising costs could push them out of their own communities.

Roughly 4 in 10 Americans say the economy or the cost of living is the most important issue facing the country, far above the share who name any other issue, and few express optimism about where the economy is headed.

Fewer agree with the Democratic Party than with the GOP on how to handle the economy, crime, America’s role in the world or immigration, but Democrats do hold an advantage on a distinctly different set of issues. Americans align more with them than Republicans on abortion, climate change and voting-related issues, according to the survey, issues which seemed to be motivating factors for much of the Democratic base in last year’s midterm elections. And the public is closely split between the Democratic and Republican approaches to helping the middle class.

Neither party has majority support for its approach to any of the topics tested in the poll, with a significant minority of the public saying their views don’t match up with either party’s positions.

Biden, who began the year with a 45% job approval rating, has since seen his numbers erode further. In polls between March and early November, about 4 in 10 approved. In the latest survey, his job approval rating stands at 37%, with 63% disapproving, a downtick that leaves him facing his worst numbers since taking office by 1 percentage point. That remains a few points higher than former President Donald Trump’s approval low point of 34%, reached in 2021 shortly after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. Trump is currently the front-runner for next year’s Republican nomination to challenge Biden.

Biden’s job approval stands at 72% among Democrats and 63% among self-described liberals, down from ratings in the 80s among those groups in January of this year. Fewer than half in most demographic groups now approve of his job performance, including college graduates (48%), Black Americans (47%), Latino Americans (42%), those 45 or older (41%), those younger than 45 (33%), White Americans (33%) and those without college degrees (31%).

A 71% majority of Americans rate economic conditions in the country as poor, with 38% calling them very poor. That marks an improvement from the summer of 2022, when 82% saw the economy as poor, but remains far worse than Americans’ pre-pandemic assessments of the economy. Views of the future are only slightly more optimistic than views of the present, with 61% expecting the economy to remain poor a year from now.

By a 10-point margin, Americans say their views on the economy align more closely with the Republican Party than with the Democratic Party; they also side with the GOP over the Democrats on crime and policing (by a 14-point margin), immigration (by 14 points) and America’s role in world affairs (by 6 points). But the public sides with the Democrats by similar margins on a slate of other issues: abortion (by 16 points), climate change (by 13 points), voting rights and election integrity (by 8 points) and education (by 5 points). Americans are more closely split on which party’s vision for helping the middle class is closer to their own (35% feel closer to Democrats, 32% to Republicans). Those divides follow a similar pattern as seen in polling last spring, in the run-up to the 2022 midterms.

Political independents side with the GOP on crime and policing (by a 13-point margin), immigration (10 points), and the economy (9 points). They align with Democrats on abortion (24 points), climate change (20 points), voting rights and election integrity (19 points), helping the middle class (13 points) and education (11 points).

About one-third of Democrats don’t think their party aligns with them on immigration, world affairs and crime; roughly similar shares of Republicans disagree with the GOP when it comes to abortion and climate change.

Asked to name the most important issue currently facing the country, 42% name economic or financial issues, a slight downtick from 48% at the start of the year, but still far ahead of any other issue. Another 12% in the most recent poll mention immigration or border security, with 10% naming foreign policy issues – an unusually high level of concern for that topic, which may be due in part to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Other topics of concern include partisanship and extremism (6%), guns and public safety (6%), and elections and threats to democracy (4%).

These concerns aren’t equally distributed across party lines. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, for instance, are 17 points likelier than Democrats and Democratic leaners to mention immigration or the border as the most important issue facing the nation, and 11 points likelier to cite economic-related issues. By contrast, Democratic-aligned adults are 8 points likelier than Republican-aligned adults to name issues related to elections and democracy, and 4 points likelier to mention environmental or energy issues.

There’s little variation among all Americans, though, in how the public views Biden’s handling of some of these top issues. Just 33% currently approve of his handling of the economy, 35% of his approach to helping the middle class and 36% of his handling of crime. The president fares slightly better on environmental policy, with 43% approving.

Economic concerns hit home for many Americans

Americans’ concerns for the country as a whole aren’t necessarily the same issues that worry them within their own communities. But both nationally and locally, economic concerns loom large.

An 84% majority say they’re at least somewhat worried about the state of the economy in their community, with 43% saying they are very worried – a rise from two years ago, when only 3 in 10 were very worried. And 74% today say they’re at least somewhat worried that the cost of living will climb so high that they will be unable to remain in their community, with 43% very worried about this possibility.

A 54% majority of those in households making less than $50,000 annually say they’re very worried about being pushed out by rising costs, as do 51% of those younger than 35, 48% of people of color and 48% of those who describe themselves as living in an urban area.

A divide on approaches to crime

A 72% majority of Americans say they’re at least somewhat worried about the risk of crime in their community, including 33% who say they’re very worried, a rise from two years ago. Sixty-five percent say they’re at least somewhat worried about violent crime, and 64% that they’re at least somewhat worried about theft and property crime in their community.

Roughly two-thirds of the public gives credence to a range of proposals to reduce crime in their community. A 71% majority says increasing police patrols would be at least somewhat likely to reduce crime while 69% say the same for increasing police funding. Similar shares endorse the potential effectiveness of enacting stricter sentencing laws for property crime (68%), increasing the number of cases in which prosecutors pursue charges (67%), increasing funding for local social services and anti-poverty programs (67%) and expanding community intervention programs (65%).

But this seeming uniformity masks some significant demographic and political divides. A 78% majority of Democrats see funding for social services as potentially helpful, more than say the same about any other proposal. By contrast, it’s the policy seen by the fewest Republicans as likely to reduce crime, with just 52% believing it would be likely to help.

Republicans, White Americans and those 45 and older are all significantly likelier than Democrats, Black Americans and those younger than 45 to say that increased policing, prosecutions and harsher sentencing are likely to reduce crime in their communities.

Most Americans express at least some confidence in their local police (68%), other people in their community (66%) and their local government (58%) to reduce crime where they live, with fewer saying the same of their state government (47%) or the US government (36%). While 77% of Americans age 45 and older, and 74% of White Americans express confidence in their local police, just 58% of those younger than 45 and 45% of Black Americans say the same.

Americans who are the most concerned about the risk of crime where they live also express the most distrust of their own community – 52% of those who are very concerned about the risk of crime say they have little or no faith in the people living near them to reduce crime levels, compared with 29% of those with less heightened concerns. Those who are very concerned about crime are also significantly likelier than others to say that more police patrols, stricter sentencing laws for property crimes and pursuing charges in more cases are very likely to reduce crime.

A 57% majority of registered voters say that the outcome of next year’s presidential election could have a big effect on the amount of crime and violence in the country, while 42% say that crime levels won’t be affected by who wins. In the fall of 2020, just 31% of registered voters thought that the upcoming presidential election would have no effect on crime.

A 73% majority of Republican voters currently say that the 2024 election could have a major effect on crime and violence, with half of Democratic and independent voters saying the same.

The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from November 1-30 among a random national sample of 1,795 adults initially reached by mail. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.

155,Biden hopes strong job market means soft landing for economy - The Associated Press,Biden hopes strong job market means soft landing for economy  The Associated Press,"Fri, 05 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2JpZGVuLWVjb25vbXktcmVjZXNzaW9uLWpvYnMtZGVidC1saW1pdC02MDExZjBhZTg3MTA0MjgwNDlkOGQ2ZmRhNDdhODhjOdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Associated Press,"WASHINGTON (AP) — For President Joe Biden, the past few days have raised hopes that the U.S. economy can stick a soft landing—possibly avoiding a recession as the 2024 election nears.

Most U.S. adults have downbeat feelings about Biden’s economic leadership, as high inflation has overshadowed a strong jobs market. It’s long been economic orthodoxy that efforts to beat back inflation by the Federal Reserve would result in unemployment rising and the country sinking into recession.

But to the president and some economists, the April jobs report issued Friday challenged that theory with its 3.4% unemployment rate and 253,000 jobs gained.

The strong jobs report came after a Wednesday Fed meeting that suggested the U.S. central bank might pause on its rate hikes, the primary tool for cutting inflation from its still high 5% to something closer to 2%. Talks are also starting over the need to raise the debt limit — with Biden inviting congressional leaders to the White House for a Tuesday meeting in hopes of ultimately getting a commitment to avoid a default.

For a president seeking a second term, Biden struck a confident tone Friday when meeting with aides even as he pushed GOP lawmakers for a clean increase on the debt cap.

“We’re trending in the right direction and I think we’re making real progress,” he said about the overall economy, telling Republican lawmakers to not “undo all this progress” with the debt limit standoff.

The economy could still stumble. Several economists forecast a recession this year, considering the wild cards of the war in Ukraine, global tensions and the debt limit fight. But the steady job gains have suggested to some policymakers and economists that it’s possible to curb inflation without layoffs.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters Wednesday that the current trends are going against history.

“It wasn’t supposed to be possible for job openings to decline by as much as they’ve declined without unemployment going up,” Powell said. “Well, that’s what we’ve seen. There’s no promises in this, but it just seems that to me that it’s possible that we will continue to have a cooling in the labor market without having the big increases in unemployment.”

Heidi Shierholz, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, said there are currently no signs of a recession and if one erupts it will be due to Fed overreach.

“We are in the middle of a soft landing right now — we have shown we can bring down wage growth, bring down inflation,” she said.

But that doesn’t mean voters are pleased with the economy. Inflation remains a persistent irritant as Biden has begun the process of launching his reelection campaign. GOP lawmakers have used the high prices in the wake of the pandemic as a political cudgel, with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., insisting on spending cuts as part of a debt limit deal in order to reduce inflation. The debt limit deals with spending obligations that the United States has already incurred and not future spending.

Just as Biden trumpets the solid job market, Fed officials could interpret the hiring as evidence that they need to raise rates higher and that could cause more pain for the economy and the Democratic administration.

“The starting point is the fact that inflation remains stubbornly high and politically troublesome,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and president of the center-right American Action Forum. ”The Fed would like to get it down. The data don’t just seem to behave. The Fed could very well hike again in June — and that would cause the financial markets to lose their collective mind.”

There is also the possibility that lawmakers fail to avert a default. Or, there could be so much drama over getting to a debt limit deal that the economy gets weaker this summer. The Treasury Department has forecast that its accounting maneuvers to keep the government running could be exhausted by early June, at which point an agreement would need to be in place.

The White House released estimates showing that brinkmanship over the debt limit — even if a deal comes together — could still cost the economy 200,000 jobs.

Nor are all economists convinced the U.S. economy has escaped the gravitational pull of a recession.

Many believe it could occur later this year, possibly shaping the 2024 campaign. The jobs report might only be a temporary reassurance for Biden, rather than a lasting win. The historical pattern could reassert itself right as the campaign season begins to intensify.

“The strong performance of the labor market dampens expectations of an immediate recession,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at the insurance company Nationwide. “Our view remains that a recession remains on the horizon, unfolding in the second half of the year, but the ongoing solid job gains and buoyancy in wage growth does suggest it could start later in the year.”","(3, 'inflation')"

Despite a growing economy and little opposition for his party’s nomination, President Joe Biden confronts a dissatisfied electorate and a challenging political climate nine months before he faces re-election, according to a new national NBC News poll.

Biden trails GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump on major policy and personal comparisons, including by more than 20 points on which candidate would better handle the economy. And Biden’s deficit versus Trump on handling immigration and the border is greater than 30 points.

The poll also shows Trump holding a 16-point advantage over Biden on being competent and effective, a reversal from 2020, when Biden was ahead of Trump on this quality by 9 points before defeating him in that election.

And Biden’s approval rating has declined to the lowest level of his presidency in NBC News polling — to 37% — while fewer than 3 in 10 voters approve of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.

All together, these numbers explain why the poll shows Trump leading Biden by 5 points among registered voters in a hypothetical 2024 general-election matchup, 47% to 42%. While the result is within the poll’s margin of error, the last year of polling shows a clear shift.

Perhaps the best news in the poll for Biden is that he pulls ahead of Trump when voters are asked about their ballot choice if the former president is convicted of a felony. Yet the margin then is just 2 points in Biden’s favor, also within the margin of error.

Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted the survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff and his team at Public Opinion Strategies, says these findings reveal “a presidency in peril.”

“What is most concerning is the erosion of Biden’s standing against Trump compared to four years ago,” Horwitt said. “On every measure compared to 2020, Biden has declined. Most damning, the belief that Biden is more likely to be up to the job — the chief tenet of the Biden candidacy — has evaporated.”

McInturff, the GOP pollster, adds: “It is hard to imagine a more difficult set of numbers before a re-election.”

But Horwitt said that Biden still has time to change voters’ perceptions.

“Biden can take solace that we are in January and not October 2024. At this stage in prior cycles, attitudes can change,” he said.

The NBC News poll, conducted Jan. 26-30, comes after Trump won his party’s presidential nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, as the Israel-Hamas war enters its fourth month, and amid positive news on the U.S. economy, including growing consumer confidence and more than 300,000 jobs created last month.

(The poll, however, was conducted before the U.S. military launched strikes Friday in retaliation for the killings of three U.S. service members in Jordan.)

“Inflation is coming down. Jobs are growing. We created 800,000 manufacturing jobs,” Biden boasted in Michigan on Thursday.

Despite those statistics, Trump holds a 22-point advantage over Biden on the question of which candidate would do a better job handling the economy, with 55% picking Trump and 33% choosing Biden.

When this question was last asked in October 2020 — a month before Biden’s victory over Trump — the then-president held only a 7-point advantage over Biden, 48% to 41%.

That said, the poll shows improving attitudes about the economy, with the share of voters believing the economy will get worse in the next year declining 14 points since October 2022.

Also in the poll, Trump has the edge on securing the border and controlling immigration (35 points over Biden), on having the necessary mental and physical health to be president (+23), on dealing with crime and violence (+21), on being competent and effective (+16), and on improving America’s standing in the world (+11).

Biden holds advantages over Trump on dealing with abortion (+12) and protecting immigrant rights (+17).

The two men are essentially tied on the issue of protecting democracy, with 43% of voters preferring Biden and 41% picking Trump.

Biden’s approval rating falls to new low

The NBC News poll also finds Biden’s overall approval rating dropping to the lowest point of his presidency, with 37% of registered voters approving and 60% disapproving — down from November’s score of 40% approving, 57% disapproving.

Biden’s current approval rating is the lowest for any president in the NBC News poll since George W. Bush’s second term.

In the new poll, Biden’s approval rating has declined especially among Latinos (just 35% of them now approve of his job performance), voters ages 18-34 (29%) and independents (27%).

Additionally, 36% of voters in the poll approve of Biden’s handling of the economy (down 2 points from November), 34% approve of his handling of foreign policy (down 1 point) and 29% approve of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza (down 5 points).

Among voters under 35 years old, only 15% approve of Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war, while a whopping 70% disapprove.

“A major through line in what ails Biden most are his travails with younger voters,” said Horwitt, the Democratic pollster.

Measuring a Biden-Trump rematch

In a hypothetical head-to-head matchup in November’s presidential contest, Trump gets support from 47% of registered voters, versus 42% who back Biden.

That 5-point lead for Trump — within the poll’s margin of error — is up from November’s 2-point advantage for Trump, 46% to 44%.

It’s consistent with other recent polling, including CNN’s national survey and battleground-state polls from Bloomberg News and Morning Consult. But a recent national Quinnipiac University poll found Biden with a 6-point lead over Trump, 50% to 44%. Overall, national surveys point to a divided country in a testy mood — and a highly contested election on the horizon.

In the new NBC News poll, Biden holds the advantage over Trump among Black voters (75% to 16%), women (50% to 40%) and white people with college degrees (50% to 42%).

Trump, meanwhile, has leads among white people without college degrees (62% to 29%), men (56% to 34%) and independents (48% to 29%).

The two men are essentially tied among Latinos (Trump 42%, Biden 41%) and voters ages 18-34 (at 42% each). Among the youngest slice of voters measured, those ages 18-29, Biden has a narrow advantage (Biden 46%, Trump 38%).

But when the poll re-asks voters — on the survey’s final question — about their ballot choice if Trump is found guilty and convicted of a felony this year, the picture shifts. Biden jumps ahead of Trump among registered voters in that case, 45% to 43%. (Read more here.)

Testing Biden, Trump and third parties

In a hypothetical matchup featuring third parties, Trump’s advantage over Biden grows to 6 points, 41% to 35% — with an unnamed Libertarian Party candidate getting 5% support, an unnamed Green Party candidate getting another 5% and an unnamed No Labels candidate getting 4%.

(While the poll didn’t test a ballot including independent presidential candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West, who are still seeking state ballot access across the country, it finds 34% of all registered voters saying they could see themselves supporting Kennedy and 10% saying the same of West.)

And in a hypothetical matchup featuring Biden and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, the NBC News poll shows Haley leading Biden by 9 points, 45% to 36%.

Trump leads Haley by 60 points in GOP race

As for Haley and the GOP presidential race after Iowa and New Hampshire, the poll has Trump leading his former U.N. ambassador by a whopping 60 points among national GOP primary voters, 79% to 19%.

In a separate question, 61% of these Republican voters say Trump should continue as the party’s leader; 14% say Trump was a good president, but it’s time to consider other leaders; and 22% say the GOP needs a new leader with better personal behavior and a different approach.

The NBC News poll was conducted Jan. 26-30 of 1,000 registered voters — 867 contacted via cellphone — and it has an overall margin of error of plus-minus 3.1 percentage points. The margin of error for the 349 Republican primary voters is plus-minus 5.25 percentage points.","(4, 'national debt')"

CNN —

If Punxsutawney Phil saw no shadow, suggesting an early spring, will Americans look at these new bonkers jobs numbers and begin to warm up to “Bidenomics?”

Americans have for years expressed a general discomfort with the state of the economy, which has helped drag down President Joe Biden’s objectively pathetic approval rating. Despite gloomy perceptions of the economy, people have not stopped spending money, which has buoyed many of the economic indicators that please policymakers.

Evidence of a strong economy has so far been lost on a general public that still feels the pinch of inflation and worries about the uncertainty of life in 2024.

Jobs, jobs, jobs

Data released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics pegged US job growth at 353,000 jobs in January, a stunning figure that doubled economists’ projections. The unemployment rate held at 3.7% and has now been under 4% for two full years.

Employment data is but one indicator. There are others to choose from. The S&P 500, the stock index that tracks the largest publicly traded companies, has been on a record-setting tear, strengthening the balances of many people’s 401(k)s.

Not enough credit, too much blame

The old political adage is that presidents get too much blame for bad economies and not enough credit for strong economies.

The coming general election, shaping up to be a rematch between Biden and former President Donald Trump, offers voters alternate realities to choose from.

Biden and his surrogates are bragging about the economy and trying to convince voters that “Bidenomics,” a term the administration’s embraced, is working.

Trump wants credit for Biden’s economy

Trump, meanwhile has said the economy would tumble and hopes it will happen on Biden’s watch rather than his own. He said the stock market is booming because of the prospect of his victory. And he’s promoting conspiracy theories about the Federal Reserve considering rate cuts to favor Biden.

Instead, as inflation has cooled, the Fed has held rates steady, as it did this week, and transmitted that people should not expect rate cuts in March either.

Everyone from investors to progressive senators are hoping for rate cuts to give people cheaper access to borrowed money and, among other things, unlock the real estate market. But Fed officials clearly want to be more certain that inflation is more under control. Their target for inflation is 2%, and recent reports suggest prices have steadied.

Predicted recession has not come

Rather than suffer the recession that was widely predicted coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic, the economy had a shockingly strong year in 2023 and is expected to grow at an even stronger 4.2% rate in the first quarter.

But that doesn’t mean things are getting cheaper. Americans are still feeling the pinch at the grocery store and everywhere else they spend money.

Signs of a thaw in public opinion, but pessimism still dominates

A new CNN poll shows Biden still has a lot of convincing to do: Perception of the economy remains deep under water. But the mood is heading in a positive direction – which should come as a relief to Biden, because the economy is one of his weakest issues, according to favorability polls.

However, if hiring remains strong and inflation keeps falling, it may become easier for Biden to convince voters he’s doing a good job strengthening the economy.

CNN’s polling editor Ariel Edwards-Levy notes that about half the country, 48%, thinks the economy remains in a downturn. Only 35% of Americans say that things in the country today are going well, which is actually an improvement from the 28% who felt positively about the state of affairs last fall.

She adds that while just 26% of Americans say they feel the economy is starting to recover from the problems it faced in the past few years, that’s also up from 20% last summer and 17% in December 2022.

Frustration with affordability continues

The Fed’s work to control inflation was always billed as tough medicine, and there’s growing frustration with it.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic senators told policymakers in a letter Sunday that they also have a duty to acknowledge that “astronomical” mortgage rates are fueling a housing affordability crisis.

“We urge you to consider the effects of your interest rate decisions on the housing market and to reverse the troubling rate hikes that have put affordable housing out of reach for too many,” Warren and fellow Democratic Sens. John Hickenlooper, Jacky Rosen and Sheldon Whitehouse wrote.

Their letter is proof that the fact of a strong economy is felt, if at all, in different ways.

Anyone hoping to buy or sell a house is not likely to say this is a great economy. Anyone in a sector, like tech, which has suffered massive layoffs, is not likely to say this is a great economy. And anyone who still feels like eggs are more expensive than they used to be may wonder how this can be a great economy.","(1, 'employment/wages')"

(AP) — President Joe Biden on Thursday unveiled $82 million for North Carolina to help connect 16,000 new households and businesses to high-speed internet, delivering an election-year pitch about policies he says are “just getting started” at improving the United States.

Watch Biden’s remarks in the player above.

Biden, the Democratic incumbent who is campaigning to win a second term, coupled his economic message with a few jabs at his predecessor, Donald Trump, currently the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination and his most likely future challenger.

Biden brought up Trump’s recent comment that he hoped the economy would crash soon because he doesn’t want to preside over job losses if he were to be reelected in November. Biden told his audience that Trump already was like Herbert Hoover, who held office during the 1929 stock market crash.

“He’s the only president to be president for four years and lose jobs,” Biden said of Trump.

Biden said the work his administration is doing in North Carolina, on high-speed internet, infrastructure and more, is happening in communities across the country, regardless of the politics.

“What we’re doing here in North Carolina is one piece of a much bigger story,” he said. Biden said he was keeping his promise “to be a president for all America, whether you voted for me or not.”

EXPLAINER: Biden isn’t on the ballot in New Hampshire’s primary. Here’s why

Biden talked about all the people who need high-speed internet because they work from home, businesses who need it to reach customers and students who need to do their school work.

“High-speed internet isn’t a luxury anymore. It’s an absolute necessity,” he said in Raleigh, the state capital. “The investment in high-speed internet means something else as well: good-paying jobs.”

Biden’s reelection campaign has made winning North Carolina and its 16 electoral votes a top priority. The Democrat narrowly lost the state in 2020 by 1.34 percentage points to Trump. They are expected to face each other again in November.

Fast-growing North Carolina is considered a presidential battleground, but only twice in the last 40-plus years has a Democrat won the state’s electoral votes: Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Barack Obama in 2008.

Trump won the state in both 2016 and 2020, with the latter victory in part a result of massive turnout for Republicans in rural and non-urban counties overcoming increasingly Democratic strongholds in and around Raleigh and Charlotte.

Republicans hold narrow veto-proof control of the state legislature and a majority on the state Supreme Court. But voters still appear comfortable with a Democratic state chief executive who attempts to counteract GOP policies, which recently have included more abortion restrictions and expanded private school vouchers. Democrats have held the governorship for all but four years since 1993.

WATCH: Biden says U.S. strikes in Yemen aren’t stopping Houthi attacks, but strikes will continue

Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who is term-limited from running this year, spoke before Biden on Thursday, boosting Biden and criticizing Trump.

“I want a president who wakes up every morning thinking about the American people instead of a president who wakes up every morning thinking about himself,” Cooper said.

Polling shows that the economy has been a weakness for Biden, a reflection of inflation hitting a four-decade high in June 2022. Easing inflation rates since then have yet to pull Biden’s approval ratings back to their levels at the start of his presidency. The president has tried to empathize with voters grappling with higher inflation, but he has stressed that his policies are fostering the creation of factory and construction jobs with middle-class wages.

“When jobs grow, everything grows,” Biden said as he ticked through federal spending on projects made possible by his pandemic aid package and an infrastructure law.

The president later picked up a burger, fries and shake from Cook Out and held what his campaign described as a “kitchen table conversation” at the home of a family that benefited from the administration’s student loan forgiveness programs.

The administration is committing a total of $3 billion to build and fund internet connections in North Carolina. The administration estimates that an additional 300,000 state residents will be able to access the internet by the end of 2026.

One way the administration says it has lowered costs for families is by providing discounted internet service to 880,000 households in North Carolina. But the administration is calling on Congress to renew the Affordable Connectivity Program, a separate source of funding that is set to run out of money in April. The program has helped 22 million people save $30 to $75 a month on their internet bills, the administration says.

CNN —

Voters and economists seem to have wildly different views of the US economy, a disconnect that’s hurting President Joe Biden in the key states that will decide the 2024 election.

There’s new polling from The Wall Street Journal that outlines the dichotomy and the challenge it represents for Biden in particular as memories of the Donald Trump years fade.

Perceptions vs. data

Swing state voters, according to the Journal, are more focused on the economy and inflation than those nationwide, and they also have a dimmer view of the state of the country.

Just one-quarter of registered voters in these seven key states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – say the economy has improved in the past two years. The economic data, on the other hand, suggests inflation is cooling and the US seems likely to avoid a recession that seemed likely a year ago. The soft landing happened without even spiking the unemployment rate, which was a real fear.

“A relatively strong economy” is how Larry Summers, the former Treasury secretary, described it last month. For context, Summers was early to raise the alarm about the threat of inflation after the Covid-19 pandemic, and he has loudly criticized the Biden administration and the Federal Reserve for most of Biden’s term.

The US economy vs. your state economy

The disconnect runs much deeper than a misalignment of voters’ perceptions and economic indicators. About half of these voters think their own economic situation is fine, and they might rate their individual states as positive. The national economy, however, gets a bad rating.

From the Journal:

In North Carolina, for example, voters describe the national economy in negative rather than positive terms by 66% to 33%. Yet those numbers are reversed when asked to rate the state’s economy. In Wisconsin, negative views of the national economy outweigh positive ones by 16 points, while positive views of the state economy outweigh negative ones by 17 points.

Across these battleground states, 46% of registered voters said their personal financial situation is headed in the right direction.

Why the disconnect?

The divide between Americans’ views of their personal finances and their broader economic sentiments isn’t new. CNN’s polling editor Ariel Edwards-Levy pointed me to Gallup polling from last April in which just 16% rated the economy as good or excellent, but 45% said their personal finances were good or excellent. (Perceptions of the economy have improved modestly in the intervening year.)

Edwards-Levy also noted that partisanship can play a role in even seemingly non-political questions about the state of the nation.

“People’s answers to surveys are often intended at least partially as an expression of partisan support or opposition,” she said, adding that is “compounded when talking about broad national trends.”

Many may feel left behind

It’s also true that while people might say in a survey that their financial situation is fine, there are indications that they also feel unable to keep up.

Just read CNN’s reporting about tenants who can’t afford to pay their rents, the barriers to home ownership that are compounded on racial minorities or the issue with 401(k) balances.

Stock markets may have repeatedly set records this year, making people with investments feel flush, but only about a quarter of registered voters across the swing states surveyed by the Journal said the ability for the average person to get ahead is moving in the right direction in the US.

The ‘once people start to focus’ argument

Biden’s task with this election cycle will be to convince these voters that their personal and state situation is writ large in the country too.

As it stands, roughly half or more of registered voters in all of the swing states in the new Wall Street Journal poll say Trump is the candidate best able to handle the key issues of the economy, inflation and immigration.

Biden’s supporters say the public will come around as the election nears.

“You know what, once people start to focus in, and they see their two choices, it’s obvious that Joe will win this election,” first lady Jill Biden said on CBS on Wednesday morning.

She disputed the Journal poll, which shows Trump holding a small lead in Arizona and North Carolina and matchups within the margin of error in the other five states. When potential independent or third-party candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are added to the question, Trump still leads by a narrow margin in Arizona and North Carolina, with no clear leader in the other states.

“He’s coming up,” Jill Biden said of the president, indicating he would rise in polls.

It’s certainly true that there’s a lot of campaigning left to do and a lot of time for developments between now and November.

Will a campaign sell voters on Biden’s economy?

On Wednesday, the president joined the progressive, independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at the White House to brag about Democrats’ efforts to contain prescription drug prices.

Biden said that by allowing Medicare to negotiate for certain prescription drugs, he and Sanders “beat Big Pharma finally.” Insulin is now capped at $35 for Medicare enrollees, for instance.

Most voters probably haven’t yet gotten the message about beating Big Pharma. More than half of US adults nationwide said they worry about being able to afford prescription drugs, according to a KFF poll released in February.

Presidential favorability ages well

George W. Bush’s favorability rating was an objectively abysmal 35% when he left office in January 2009, according to CNN polling at the time. Nine years later, as Americans lived through the next Republican presidency – Trump’s – Bush’s favorability rating had completely rebounded. With the Iraq War and the Great Recession in the rearview mirror – and with Bush, unlike Trump, out of politics – 61% of Americans had a favorable view of him.

Trump’s approval rating may have partially rebounded even though he is still very much in the political mix. More than half the country thought Trump should be removed from office after the January 6, 2021, insurrection, according to CNN polling at the time. His approval rating was just 34%. In the years since, as the shock of the attack on the US Capitol has faded and voters came to associate Biden with the White House and the trying years of the pandemic, views of Trump in hindsight have improved.

Now, more than half of registered voters in the Wall Street Journal poll of battleground states said they either strongly or somewhat approve of the job Trump did as president. That blur of hindsight is a huge advantage for Trump. Just 38% of registered voters in the Journal poll said they either strongly or somewhat approve of the job Biden is doing as president.

Biden is neck-and-neck with Trump among registered voters in those seven swing states on the question of protecting democracy. That should stun the White House since Biden has made protecting democracy, both in the US and abroad, the central tenet of his entire presidency.","(3, 'inflation')"

But polling has consistently shown the economy to be a weak spot for Biden’s reelection hopes. Just 33 percent approve of his leadership on the issue, according to a May survey by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs.

For much of his presidency, Biden has blamed high gasoline prices, painfully rising food costs and other cost-of-living expenses on the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. He said those two factors were beyond his control as inflation hit a 40-year high last summer and crushed the his approval ratings.

Indeed, the rate of inflation has fallen over the past year while the job market has remained solid, a combination that seemed unlikely to many economic analysts.

In a Chicago speech on Wednesday, Biden will begin a new effort to actively convince a worried public that the U.S. economy is not heading for recession but actually thriving because of his leadership. For him, there’s a happy confluence of the coming 2024 reelection campaign and a favorable turn in recent economic data, leading the White House to believe that public messaging about “Bidenomics” will help to rally Democratic voters going into next year.

The message is not a new one, though the White House believes it bears repeating so that it soaks in. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at Monday’s news briefing that the president’s upcoming remarks would be a “cornerstone” speech and part of a larger administration-wide effort.

“It’s a vision about growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up — you hear us say that over and over again, because we believe that trickle-down economics does not work,” Jean-Pierre said. “We have the data to prove it.”

Indeed, the rate of inflation has fallen over the past year while the job market has remained solid, a combination that seemed unlikely to many economic analysts who expected efforts to bring down inflation would cause layoffs and a recession. Goldman Sachs has put the odds of a recession in the next 12 months at 25 percent, down from its previous estimate of 35 percent.

Consumer prices rose at an annual pace of 4 percent in May, down from 9.1 percent last June. That’s still higher than the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target, indicating that inflation remains a challenge. But employers added a robust 339,000 jobs last month in a sign that the economy appears poised to keep growing. And the inflation-adjusted annual increase in what people earn each hour turned positive in May, one of the main indicators that White House officials had been looking at for proof the economy was helping workers.

Biden’s GOP rivals have said that the president has broken the U.S. economy. They’ve tip-toed around the healthy 3.7 percent unemployment rate and focused instead on prices at the gas pump, grocery bills, the debt tied to Biden’s $1.9 trillion in pandemic relief and the administration’s focus on shifting away from fossil fuels in order to combat climate change.

“I will stop Joe Biden’s inflation nightmare, save the U.S. economy,” said former President Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner, in a speech to evangelical Christians last weekend.

“You would think that with these economic problems with inflation, you may want to tap into more domestic energy,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in an Iowa speech. “But no, Biden is deliberately trying to kneecap our energy production and he’s trying to force Americans into electric vehicles, which will make us more reliant on China, who provides most of the materials for the batteries.”

Part of Biden’s challenge is that confidence in his economic leadership has waned. In March 2021 just after his round of pandemic relief became law, 60 percent of U.S. adults approved of how the president was handling the economy, according to an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs poll. Since then, that figure has essentially halved.

Still, there are signs that people’s views of the economy are improving. The University of Michigan’s survey of consumer sentiment showed that Democrats, Republicans and unaffiliated voters generally feel better about the current state of the economy than they did a year ago. But confidence among Democrats is still weaker than it was during Biden’s first year.

The administration released a memo ahead of Biden’s Wednesday speech that made the point that his policy ideas are broadly supported in polls, leaving unsaid that those proposals generally fare better than the president himself does.

Biden aides see ‘Bidenomics’ as an expansive framing to a host of the president’s policies for easy public consumption, tying together a diverse set of initiatives meant to boost the nation’s global competitiveness with programs meant to strengthen the middle class at home.

The president is betting that targeted government investments can catapult the economy forward and help workers. During his first two years when Democrats controlled the House, Biden followed up on his pandemic relief by pushing through a bipartisan infrastructure building bill, funding for computer chip plants and tax breaks to encourage the use of renewable energy.

This approach goes back to Biden’s own blue collar identity that surfaces in his speeches: the Scranton, Pennsylvania kid whose family at times just eked by financially.

But it can take several years to replace bridges and tunnels, to build new factories, to lay broadband cable for the internet and to make drivers comfortable with buying electric vehicles. Administration officials have privately acknowledged that there is a lag between the economy that the president is promising and what voters will likely see by the 2024 elections.

Biden in remarks in July 2021 had initially dismissed higher inflation as “transitory,” saying he was confident that the bout coming out of the pandemic was temporary. Those remarks became a point of attack among Republican lawmakers and some economists as inflation worsened after his statement.

Yet Biden has stressed that he provides an alternative to GOP policies that try to boost the economy mostly through tax cuts. He said Monday in announcing more than $40 billion to ensure high-speed internet for the entire country that his ideas are similar to the New Deal-era playbook used to combat the Great Depression nearly a century ago.

“What we are doing, as I said, is not unlike what Franklin Delano Roosevelt did when he brought electricity to nearly every American home and farm,” Biden said.

The question is whether voters think that Biden can deliver just as FDR did and whether elections work the same as they did back in 1936, when the Rural Electrification Act became law. Later that November, Roosevelt won more than 60 percent of the popular vote as he won a second term.

In today’s polarized era, Biden is unlikely to secure anywhere near that margin. But his message on Wednesday will likely be that his presidency has already begun to reshape the world’s largest economy for the better and voters should judge him on that record.

He previewed the takeaway he wants voters to hear at a fundraiser last week in California, even as polls indicate that much of the public still feels pessimistic about the direction of the U.S.

“We unleashed, I think,” he said, “a sense of expectation in America that we can do anything.”

President Joe Biden is trying to win a second term this year by selling an economic rebound, with data to back it all up. But voters sure seem slow to buy that.

Former President Donald Trump paints a picture of looming economic collapse with his standard “only I can fix it” messaging. He went so far this month to openly wish for an economic “crash” in the country this year.

Everyone else is giving off wait-and-see vibes. That's bad news for both Biden and Trump.

Ask economists and people who understand political messaging. They'll tell you, like they told me, that Biden needs voters to feel much better right now about their economic outlook. And Trump needs people to fear it's all teetering on the edge of a cliff.

The truth, as always, is somewhere in the middle. The economy is improving, but it's not all the way back. Inflation is slowing, but things still cost more than they used to. The numbers look good, but numbers don't always go in the direction you want.

When will voters see the realities of the economy?

Larry Sabato, director of University of Virginia's Center for Politics, told me the economy “is usually a lagging indicator” for voters showing confidence that we’re in an upswing.

“It takes people a while to believe good news in particular,” Sabato said. “Fortunately for President Biden, the economy is clearly turning around at the right time for November.”

Abortion is a win for Democrats:Biden refocuses his campaign on abortion rights, reminding voters Trump took Roe away

While Trump’s base won’t stray with the news, Sabato added, Biden’s second term hinges on him motivating his own voters and “winning the small number of true independents.”

Here’s what the math shows us about the economy now: America’s economy grew at a rate of 3.3% in the last three months of 2023 and by 2.5% overall for the year.

Trump bragged about an economy he now says will ruin the country. Biden took that opportunity to laugh.

Trump spent most of his lone term as president bragging about similar numbers.

The Democratic National Committee on Thursday brought receipts, offering links to six times that Trump took credit for economic growth in 2017 and 2018.

In one, Trump said during a July 2017 Cabinet meeting that a 2.6% quarterly growth rate that had just been announced “is an unbelievable number.” Two months later, he told reporters flying with him on Air Force One that “everybody was shocked” to see a newly announced quarterly rate of 3%.

Trump is singing a different song these days. Campaigning in New Hampshire on Monday, he called Biden “a disaster on the economy.”

Even Trump, in that speech, had to slip in a caveat – “except for the stock market.” He was speaking just days after the S&P 500 hit a record high.

Biden had some fun with that Monday, posting video on the website previously known as Twitter of Trump claiming before the 2020 election that the country would see “a stock market collapse the likes of which you’ve never had” if Biden won. It was coupled with a clip from Fox News touting the recent good news about the stock market.

“Good one, Donald,” the current president trolled his predecessor.

Trump knows he needs the economy to tank for him to get reelected

Trump has good reason to hope for a bad economy. Any win for Biden makes Trump’s bid for the White House less likely to succeed.

That’s why Trump is trying to kill bipartisan negotiations in the Senate on legislation to improve border security and reform immigration. That would erase another line of attack for the ex-president.

This is what Republicans support:Judge Kaplan said outright Trump sexually assaulted E. Jean Carroll

Trump is playing to consumer fear while Biden courts them with hope. Fear has always been an easier sell.

When will voters believe the good economic news?

We just spent 2023 listening to endless punditry about an allegedly looming recession. And while those warnings are on the wane, they clearly left some lingering doubt, particularly along partisan lines.

A Suffolk University/USA TODAY poll this month showed signs of optimism, but it also found that Republicans were far more likely than Democrats to assume the country is in a recession rather than in recovery.

Joanne Hsu, director of University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers, said consumer confidence has been “relatively slow” to rebound in the past year, despite the evidence of an improving economy. But then it jumped by nearly 30% as 2023 became 2024.

“That’s really unusual,” Hsu said. “The last time we saw an increase of that magnitude was in 1991, when we were coming out of a recession.”

This confidence, she added, is reflected among Democrats, Republicans and independents. Even so, she cautioned, it's still trending at about 7% lower than the historical average, compiled since 1978.

Inflation issue lingers with voters

James Pethokoukis, who analyzes economic policy as a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said inflation is “the entire story” about consumer confidence because we all just lived through a spike in increased cost unlike anything seen in the past 40 years. That sticks with people more and longer than other economic news – unemployment, job layoffs, interest rates and so on.

“Inflation, that affects everyone,” he said. “It is a far more pervasive phenomenon. So it was an economic shock.”

And, with inflation, prices are more likely to stop going up than they are to come down. Pethokoukis said this summer will be critical for the economy, consumer sentiment and the presidential election.

“People have short memories,” Pethokoukis said. “They’re going to care a lot more about what happens in the economy in the six months before they go to the polls in 2024 than what happened in 2021 or 2022.”

Expect to hear plenty from Biden between now and November about things looking up. He'll be touting statistics, just like Trump back in 2017 and 2018.

And Trump will spout pessimism nonstop, since a bad economy is good for him. He's already shown a willingness to lie about the data and distort economic conditions because that's what he needs to win. The better things get, the more we'll hear about how terrible it all is.

In a Wednesday appearance on the ABC late-night show “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” President Joe Biden made a dramatic claim about the US economy – and repeated himself for emphasis.

“Look, here’s where we are. We have the fastest-growing economy in the world. The world. The world,” Biden said.

Facts First: Biden’s claim is false. The US economy grew by 5.7% in 2021, but more than 50 other countries had faster growth that year, figures published by the International Monetary Fund show; many of them are small or developing countries, but some of them are large or wealthy. In addition, the US economy shrank in the first quarter of 2022, while various other countries experienced growth. And while economic experts expect the US economy to resume growing over the rest of this year, a significant number of other countries are expected to grow faster.

Asked for comment on Friday, a White House official did not attempt to specifically defend Biden’s claim that the US has the fastest-growing economy in the world.

Instead, the official pointed out that the 5.7% growth in the United States’ real gross domestic product in 2021 was the fastest for the country since 1984. The official also pointed out that the International Monetary Fund has projected that, as of the fourth quarter of this year, the size of the US economy will be bigger relative to its late-2019 pre-pandemic level than any of the other six countries in the international forum known as the Group of Seven: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom.

Those comments are accurate. But Biden said on Kimmel’s show, three times, that the US economy is growing faster than that of any other country in “the world,” not just growing faster than six particular countries. And that’s inaccurate.

“Clearly the US has been the G-7 economy that has done best in terms of GDP growth rates since the inception of COVID, but is not literally the fastest-growing economy in the world over this period,” said Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti, a former International Monetary Fund official who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank’s Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy.

How the US compares

Biden took office in late January 2021. Among the dozens of countries that saw faster real GDP growth than the US in 2021 were Ireland (13.5%), Chile (11.7%), Turkey (11%), Colombia (10.6%), India (8.7% for the fiscal year that began in April 2021), Greece (8.3%), Israel (8.2%), China (8.1%), the United Kingdom (7.4%), France (7%) and Italy (6.6%), according to figures published by the IMF and the countries’ governments. (Many countries’ growth rates were higher than usual in 2021 because their economies were rebounding from the 2020 economic crisis caused by the pandemic.)

An economic outlook released this week by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development projected the US would grow by 2.5% in 2022. That was lower than the OECD’s 2022 projections for 11 other members of the Group of 20 international forum: Saudi Arabia (7.8%), India (6.9% for the fiscal year), Indonesia (4.7%), China (4.4%), Australia (4.2%), Spain (4.1%), Canada (3.8%), Turkey (3.7%), the United Kingdom (3.6%), Argentina (3.6%) and South Korea (2.7%).

We’ll add one caveat. There are various ways to measure growth – among other things, you can pick different start and end points and different gauges of economic activity – and there are various complications involved in the data.

Laura Veldkamp, a finance professor at Columbia University’s business school, said there is “no way” that Biden’s claim is true if he was using “fastest-growing” in the usual way, referring to a percentage change. She said, however, that she would personally describe the President’s claim as “misleading,” rather than false, since “the word growth in conversation can mean many things.”

We’ll respectfully stick with our harsher conclusion. If Biden was citing some unusual or obscure measure of growth, he could have explained that. He didn’t, and the White House didn’t either when asked for comment.","(0, 'GDP')"

President Joe Biden on Wednesday formally unveiled “Bidenomics,” the ground-up economic philosophy he claims serves as the driving force behind the US economy’s success.

When an economy grows “from the middle out and the bottom up instead of just the top down… everybody does well,” Biden said in a speech from Chicago.

But the economy’s track record under Biden is anything but flawless. And while Biden’s growing list of Republican challengers differ on many issues, when it comes to the economy, they’re in agreement that Biden failed.

In reality, it’s a mixed bag.

Americans have grappled with inflation for more than a year, including a painstaking issue with housing affordability as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates 10 times in a row to bring that inflation down.

In addition, a tight labor market has left many small businesses with ongoing hiring difficulties. Meanwhile, in anticipation of a recession, large companies have tightened their belts and resized their workforce by laying off thousands of workers.

But it hasn’t all been bad. American workers have rejoiced in a robust labor market that has allowed them to quit their jobs for a better one — one that can pay them more or allow them the flexibility of working from home.

Many Americans were given a financial boost during the Covid pandemic in the form of stimulus checks and a break from student loan payments, although the latter are restarting later this year.

The economy evolved immensely during and after the pandemic. Here’s what Biden can take credit for – and what he can’t.

Fiscal largesse

Some major spending packages passed by Congress did happen under Biden’s watch — from the American Rescue Plan to the Inflation Reduction Act — funneling trillions of dollars toward infrastructure, workforce development, state and local governments and the costly public health response to Covid.

While government spending bolsters consumer demand, it also boosts business investment. Manufacturers’ spending on construction has soared in recent months due to funding Congress approved for infrastructure.

The Treasury Department released an analysis this week that showed the increase in construction spending from manufacturers has been “principally driven by construction for computer, electronic, and electrical manufacturing” and that “the surge appears to be uniquely American — not mirrored in other advanced economies.”

Biden can claim credit for that, but until manufacturers begin to hire workers at a solid clip, it’s hard for Biden to declare there’s a manufacturing boom.

For now, demand for goods has slowed in the United States and other major economies, according to business surveys from S&P Global and the Institute for Supply Management.

In other aspects, the labor market certainly had a boost from Biden’s fiscal policies. The American Rescue plan provided $40 billion toward workforce development, funneled through state and local governments, which aimed to address demographic disparities and invested in the public health workforce.

Still, the economic outlook remains uncertain. While Biden joked Wednesday that he has heard people “forecast the possibility of a recession for 24 months, and it hasn’t happened,” Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at a central banker panel Wednesday he is not ruling out a recession. However, some economists and bank CEOs think a recession could come later than expected.

Plentiful jobs and record low unemployment — but not all thanks to Biden

Since Biden took office in January 2021, the unemployment rate has plunged to 3.7% from 6.3%. All the jobs that were lost due to the pandemic-induced recession were fully restored last summer. Since then, the American workforce has consistently outpaced the pre-pandemic workforce.

However, the labor market had begun to make a comeback well before Biden’s inauguration. Many of the job gains during his presidency were likely a continuation of the bounce-back effect that came as the economy reopened.

Americans are also earning more. Since Biden became president, average hourly earnings have risen by 12% to $33.44, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although that is also connected to the pace of post-pandemic recovery.

And, as Biden pointed out Wednesday, several polls indicate job satisfaction is at a record high.

That said, the labor market is unbalanced.

There are almost 4 million more job openings than the number of people looking for work. That has forced employers to raise wages to lure in more workers.

Biden sees that as a victory. “Pay for low-wage workers is growing at the fastest pace in over two decades,” he said Wednesday.

However, the Fed is less gung-ho about those wage increases, since they’re feeding directly into inflation.

Is Biden to blame for inflation?

Republicans have repeatedly slammed Biden for decades-high inflation, decrying it as the consequence of out-of-control government spending. The causes of inflation are nuanced, but a faction of economists and analysts argue that generous government spending played some role.

Ben Bernanke, the former Fed chair who helmed the central bank during the Great Recession, and Olivier Blanchard, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, argued in a paper presented at the Brookings Institution in May that inflation’s eruption was first driven by shortages and energy prices.

But the two economists asserted that inflation continued to rise because of stimulus-fueled demand and low interest rates.

Although the spending packages passed under Biden are not the main culprits behind inflation – war in Ukraine and the pandemic played a huge part – government spending did play some role. It’s just no longer a source of inflation.

“I will add, though, without crossing any lines, that the spending during the pandemic was very high and it’s come down — and so we look at the fiscal impulse from the level of spending and it’s really not material. It may even be slightly contraction, but let’s just say it’s flat,” said Fed Chair Jerome Powell Wednesday during a panel hosted by the European Central Bank. “If you look at where the inflation is in the economy, I wouldn’t say that that’s an important driver of inflation or something that we think about or consider.”

Inflation has in fact retreated from the four-decade high in June 2022, in large part due to falling energy prices, but Bernanke’s paper argued that the economy needs to slow further to address the labor market’s persistent impact on inflation.

Biden’s response to the inflation criticism is that it’s worse in other major economies.

Americans are in more debt than ever

Whether or not Biden is to blame for inflation, it’s undeniable that it has created financial hardships for Americans.

Household debt is at a $17 trillion record high, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

That’s a 16% increase from when Biden took office.

Americans are piling on debt and struggling to make loan repayments on time as inflation continues to erode the value of their paychecks.

It’s clear that Americans have been remarkably resilient in the face of high inflation, punishing rate hikes, persistent housing unaffordability, economic uncertainty and an unforgiving pandemic that upended every facet of society. Biden should be given credit whenever it is due, but so should everyday Americans.","(3, 'inflation')"

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su, Environmental Protection Agency Chief of Staff Dan Utech, and other key stakeholders participated in a “Good Jobs in the Clean Economy” event with labor, conservation and environmental justice leaders to discuss how their agencies are collaborating to create good quality jobs in infrastructure, clean energy, manufacturing and technology as part of the President’s Investing in America agenda.

During the event, Secretary Haaland and Acting Secretary Su signed a Signed MOU With DOL On GJI [pdf]

to promote cooperative efforts between the two agencies to build sustainable career pathways that meet industry needs for talent and worker needs for quality jobs. The partnerships will enable both departments to share resources and expertise to guide their actions to meet their shared goals to expand an equitable and diverse workforce while taking significant action to combat climate change.

“With funding from the President’s Investing in America agenda, we are putting historic resources into the American workforce throughout our nation that support conservation, legacy pollution clean up, outdoor recreation, and our collective effort to address the climate crisis,” said Secretary Deb Haaland. “I’m thrilled that our new Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Labor will support continued cooperative efforts that help us draw on the strength and creativity of every worker in America.”

“The benefits made possible by our partnership will show we don’t need to choose between good jobs and climate action when, in fact, we can achieve both,” said Acting Secretary Julie Su. “The Investing in America agenda gives us an historic opportunity to put workers first and act to address climate change and other environmental concerns. It also allows us to include workers and communities historically left behind.”

Through the “Bidenomics” strategy, the Biden-Harris administration is growing the American economy from the middle out and bottom up – from rebuilding our nation’s infrastructure, to driving over $500 billion in private sector manufacturing and clean energy investments in the United States, to creating good paying jobs and building a clean energy economy that will combat climate change and make our communities more resilient. The Administration is making a once-in-a-generation investment in America’s infrastructure and our clean energy future and taking the next steps to bring offshore wind energy to additional areas around the country.

Since Day 1 of the Biden-Harris administration, the Department of the Interior has been leading the way in creating good-paying jobs in the clean energy economy, including jobs conserving and restoring public lands and waters, reducing the risk of wildland fire, addressing toxic legacy pollution sites, improving access to recreation and constructing new onshore and offshore clean energy projects.

The Department today released a new fact sheet highlighting workforce development and job creation efforts underway. Clean Energy Fact Sheet [pdf]

177,"President Biden focuses on factory jobs in Wisconsin, ignoring latest Trump indictment - The Associated Press","President Biden focuses on factory jobs in Wisconsin, ignoring latest Trump indictment  The Associated Press","Tue, 15 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2JpZGVuLXBvbGl0aWNzLWluZmxhdGlvbi1lY29ub215LXdpc2NvbnNpbi1iaWRlbm9taWNzLWU2NjVhZTg1OGYwM2YyZDYyY2JhNjViNmM0NjI1ZDNm0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Associated Press,"MILWAUKEE (AP) — On the heels of a fourth indictment for Donald Trump, President Joe Biden focused on manufacturing jobs in a speech at a Wisconsin factory — putting his ideas for growth up against his Republican rivals in a bid to win over voters in a key state in next year’s presidential election.

“It’s really kind of basic: we just decided to invest in America again,” Biden said Tuesday. “That’s what it’s all about.”

His arrival in Milwaukee came on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act, a major piece of economic legislation he signed into law with great ceremony but polls show that most people know little about it or what it does. It also occurred a week before Republicans descend on Milwaukee for the party’s first presidential debate. But as Biden spoke, much of the political world was focused on his predecessor, Trump, who was charged late Monday in Georgia on an alleged scheme to illegally overturn the results of the 2020 election.

Wisconsin is among the handful of critical states where Biden needs to persuade voters that his policies are having a positive impact on their lives by generating roughly $500 billion in corporate investments in factories and other facilities. The president ignored Trump in his speech, but he made the economic case personal by directly challenging the state’s Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, who was just reelected in 2022 and not up again until 2028.

Biden said that his ideas are in opposition to “the conservative Republican view, the so-called MAGA view, which is focused on corporate profits.”

“But you know who believes that?” the president said. “Your significant Senator Ron Johnson. He believes outsourcing manufacturing jobs is a great thing.”

Other Democrats on Tuesday openly compared Biden’s trip to discuss policy with the legal challenges of Trump, the Republican frontrunner trying to oust him in 2024.

“The contrast between Republicans and us is incredible,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters Tuesday on a conference call.

Republican lawmakers are focused on criticizing Biden’s economic leadership over inflation hitting a four-decade peak last summer, saying that many U.S. families are still struggling as a result of higher prices.

“Real wages are down and gas prices are up,” House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said on X, the social media platform formerly known at Twitter. “You are paying the price for failed leadership.”

Biden toured Ingeteam, a clean energy manufacturer of onshore wind turbine generators in Milwaukee, and talked up provisions of the law to boost domestic manufacturing and clean energy, lower health care costs and crack down on billionaires who paying their avoid taxes.

Ingeteam plans to hire 100 workers using Bipartisan Infrastructure Law money to start producing electric vehicle charging stations domestically, according to the White House.

Also timed to Biden’s trip, multinational tech firm Siemens is set to announce that it will start manufacturing solar inverters in Wisconsin’s Kenosha County, a move prompted by increased demand brought by the tax incentives from the IRA law.

Administration officials say the trip is aimed at recognizing the effects of the law, which passed Congress on party-line votes. According to the White House, in Wisconsin, private firms have committed more than $3 billion in manufacturing and clean energy investments since Biden was sworn into office.

Some critics of the legislation say provisions of the law could ultimately end up increasing inflation, even though the annual rate of inflation has fallen from 9% last summer to 3.2% in its most recent 12-month reading. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said during a virtual Peterson Institute for International Economics event in July that while he supported the IRA, the Biden administration’s overall economic agenda is “increasingly dangerous.”

“I am profoundly concerned by the doctrine of manufacturing-centered economic nationalism that is increasingly being put forth as a general principle to guide policy,” Summers said.

Vice President Kamala Harris and top Cabinet officials will be fanning out across the country this week to talk about the Inflation Reduction Act and its provisions. Biden has scheduled an anniversary event at the White House on Wednesday.

The president’s stop in Wisconsin comes shortly before Republicans hold their first presidential primary debate in Milwaukee on Aug. 23. Former President Donald Trump — the leading Republican candidate in polls — has yet to say whether he will boycott or hold a competing event.

Democratic gains helped decide a critical state Supreme Court race this spring that moved Wisconsin’s highest court under liberal control for the first time in 15 years. Republicans, though, will compete aggressively in the state, selecting Milwaukee as the site of its 2024 national nominating convention.

Charles Franklin, director of Marquette Law School Poll, said the trip could help Biden win support from independents, who make up about 10% of voters in the state.

“What he really needs to do is get independents in the state to like him a bit better,” Franklin said. “Coming and talking about his achievements, about factories that are working with American jobs — all of that is a good reason to come to speak to those folks in the state who are not partisans.”

“Because Democrats are already behind him,” Franklin said, and “Republicans are almost certainly not going to cross over.”

They blew up the deficit. It produced an anemic economic growth, if any growth at all. And it stripped the dignity and pride and hope out of a community, one after another,” he said.

Despite criticism from Republicans, Biden assured that the economy is in good shape, saying the U.S. has the lowest inflation rate of any major economy. He also criticized recent Republican spending bill proposals as well as broader “ trickle down ” economic policies.

“It’s about growing the economy from the middle out and bottom up instead of the top down,” he said. “Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well.”

Speaking at Prince George’s Community College in Largo, Maryland, Biden made the case for his administration’s economic vision amid recession fears .

President Joe Biden delivered remarks Thursday on the economy as House Republicans launch an impeachment inquiry and a possible federal government shutdown.

Biden on Wednesday brushed off the House Republicans’ impeachment inquiry, saying the way he sees it, they launched the investigation against him because they want to shut down the federal government.

Biden, speaking at a Democratic fundraiser in Virginia, said that instead of being concerned about the probe, “I’m focused on the things the American people want me focused on.”

The president’s remarks were the first since Speaker Kevin McCarthy announced the launch of a Biden impeachment inquiry while the Republican House leader is also struggling to shore up votes to fund the government and prevent a federal shutdown.

“The best I can tell is they want to impeach me because they want to shut down the government,” Biden said.

He also made a reference to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a top ally of his chief rival heading into the 2024 election, Donald Trump. “The first day she was elected, the first thing she wanted to do was impeach Biden,” he said.

“Look, I’ve got a job,” Biden told his audience. “I’ve got to deal with the issues that affect the American people every single, solitary day.”

McCarthy’s sudden decision to direct an impeachment inquiry into Biden over the business dealings of his son, Hunter, and the family finances has won over even the most reluctant Republicans, with some GOP lawmakers pushing for swift action while others expect it to drag into the 2024 election year.

McCarthy opened and closed a private meeting Wednesday of House Republicans justifying his reasoning for the inquiry sought by former President Trump.

The moment is a politically pivotal one for the embattled McCarthy, whose job is being targeted by Trump’s right-flank allies. He has already signaled potential charges of abuse of power, corruption and obstruction for possible articles of impeachment.

“There’s a lot of accusations out there you just want the answers to,” McCarthy told reporters at the Capitol.

The White House mobilized to fight what it called the “unprecedented, unfounded claims” against the president regarding his son, Hunter, and family finances.

Hard-right Republicans still want McCarthy to slash federal spending below the levels he and Biden agreed to as part of a budget deal earlier this year. And that stand risks a federal shutdown if they don’t fund the government by Sept. 30, when current money runs out.

Democrats are expected to oppose those Republican efforts as well as fight Biden’s impeachment.

Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who led the first impeachment of Trump, said McCarthy’s failure to bring the inquiry before the full House for a vote was “an acknowledgement that he lacks the support in his conference to move forward.”

“He is beholden to the more extreme elements,” Schiff said as lawmakers returned to Washington late Tuesday. “It is yet another indication of the weakness in the speakership and the degree by which he is manipulated by Donald Trump.”

Yet moderate Republicans representing districts that Biden won in 2020 over Trump and who are most at risk in next year’s election generally were supportive of McCarthy’s decision to launch the impeachment probe.

“I would have voted for it,” Rep. Mike Garcia, R-Calif., said about the impeachment inquiry.

Garcia said, “There’s smoke there so we have a requirement to go investigate that and see if there’s fire there.”

Rep. Nick LaLota of New York, another one of the Republicans from districts Biden won, said he wasn’t worried about any backlash back home.

“I think my constituents deserve some answers,” he said.","(4, 'national debt')"

The messaging effort reflects a renewed confidence among Biden’s economic brain trust in the resilience of the U.S. economy and the president’s stewardship, after the administration was relentlessly hammered for more than two years over high inflation and widespread predictions of an imminent recession. On Thursday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that the nation’s economy grew by 2.5 percent over the course of the last year, including a robust annual rate of 3.3 percent in the most recent quarter.

“The U.S. economy is on a very desirable path,” Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen told reporters at the Treasury Department on Wednesday. “And my expectation is, in spite of the fact that there are always risks, the economy is doing very, very well.”

Aiming to capitalize on the strong data, Yellen delivered a landmark address in Chicago on Thursday aimed at both defending the administration’s economic record thus far and beginning to outline its plans for a second-term agenda. In prepared remarks, Yellen rebuked the forecasters who “thought a recession last year was inevitable.” She also touted low gas prices, a jump in consumer sentiment, rising wealth relative to pre-pandemic levels, a decline in the gap between rural and urban unemployment, caps on some drug prices, and some other signs of economic improvement.

“It’s been the fairest recovery on record,” Yellen said, according to her prepared remarks. “The recovery we’ve had — instead of one that was weaker or less fair — meant that we avoided financial pain for most middle-class American families.”

Speaking in Wisconsin on Thursday, Biden similarly said: “I don’t want to bore you all with detail, but, you know, the experts, from the time I got elected, were insisting that a recession was just around the corner. Every month, there was going to be a recession. Well, you know, we’ve got really strong growth.”

The administration’s posture comes amid a broader rethinking of the politics of the U.S. economy, which once appeared to be former president Donald Trump’s most effective weapon in the 2024 presidential campaign. Although Republicans remain optimistic the economy is still a potent winning message — particularly given the administration’s initial attempts to downplay price hikes in 2021 and 2022 — the GOP’s economic case has certainly gotten more difficult, as inflation has fallen from around 9 percent to closer to 3 percent.

Some analysts stress that risks remain to the economy, and there is still a chance that inflation reaccelerates.

“There’s no question about it that the data at the end of this morning were fantastic. The economy has embarrassed people who have called for recessions, and it embarrassed people who called for an end to inflation too early,” said Stephen Miran, who served as an economic analyst at the Treasury Department in the Trump administration. “But it’s premature to be celebrating just yet — inflation risks are real, and recession risks are still real. It’s hard to imagine the economy can have tight labor and housing markets and not see real inflation risks.”

Still, the White House is also growing more assertive in its messaging on the economy. On Thursday, the White House Council of Economic Advisers released a report showing that the “blue chip” index of top economic forecasters had badly misjudged the direction of the economy, projecting much higher inflation and unemployment than turned out to be the case.

“The data tell a compelling story of an economy that has significantly defied expectations, and where persistently tight labor markets and easing price pressures are supporting macroeconomic growth,” the report stated.","(0, 'GDP')"

It’s been hard for voters to digest the mix of roads-and-bridges spending, tax hikes on big companies, tax credits for parents, tax breaks for renewable energy, grants to build computer chip factories, insulin price caps and slogans like “Build Back Better.”

And that barely covers the full breadth of what the administration is doing and trying to do.

Last week, the president gave a speech on “Bidenomics” in hopes that the term will lodge in voters’ minds ahead of the 2024 elections. But what is Bidenomics? Let’s just say the White House definition is different from the Republican one — evidence that catchphrases can be double-edged.

Biden says his economic philosophy is the opposite of a Republican approach that favors broad tax cuts to spur growth. He sees the government as using the tax code in a more targeted fashion and fashioning other programs to foster investment in new technologies, create jobs and boost upward mobility. He wants to do more to educate workers and foster competition within the U.S. economy in hopes of reducing prices.

“I came into office determined to change the economic direction of this country, to move from trickle-down economics to what everyone in The Wall Street Journal and Financial Times began to call ‘Bidenomics,’” the president said. “I didn’t come up with the name. I really didn’t.”

But to Republicans, “Bidenomics” is a slur they can deploy. It’s a philosophy of government spending and anti-oil policies that they say fueled a spike in inflation last summer to a four-decade high. High prices have left U.S. adults deeply pessimistic about the economy, with just 34% approving of Biden’s leadership on the issue, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs.

Here’s the latest for Monday July 3rd: Baltimore police search for mass shooting suspects; France deploys thousands of police to stop violent protests; Massive downpour in Chicago; Hotel worker strike in Southern California.

Based on follow-up interviews with poll respondents, they’re far more aware of gasoline and grocery store prices than the details of Biden’s policies. When asked over the course of multiple polls, a few could cite the bipartisan infrastructure package that Biden signed into law. But the Inflation Reduction Act as well as the CHIPS and Science Act have yet to fully surface on the public radar, despite outreach by the administration and news coverage.

GOP lawmakers were faster to embrace the catch-term than the president.

“Instead of priming the pump, Bidenomics has emptied the tank,” future House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said in a 2021 floor speech. “From inflation to gas lines, the American economy today looks more like it did in 1979 than 2019.”

In case you’re wondering, McCarthy’s 1979 dig refers to high prices under then President Jimmy Carter, who in the 1980 election was bested by Republican Ronald Reagan.

A White House official, insisting on anonymity, said the term Bidenomics was not poll-tested.

The administration says it came from media reports, with The New York Times, National Public Radio, Bloomberg News, The Economist, and even AP using it in reports before the president took the oath of office.

Nor is the phrasing all that novel. Commentators have given the American public the portmanteau words Nixonomics, Carternomics, Reaganomics, Clintonomics, Bushonomics, Obamanomics. When the conservative economists Arthur Laffer and Stephen Moore wrote a book to describe the policies of then President Donald Trump, they entitled it “Trumponomics: Inside the America First Plan to Revive Our Economy.”

President Gerald Ford went with “Whip Inflation Now,” or WIN, in the mid-1970s. Ford’s push had a bit more fanfare than the Bidenomics launch did with the president’s speech this past week at the Old Chicago Main Post Office.

For Ford’s effort, Meredith Willson — famous for writing the musical “The Music Man” — crafted a song entitled ”WIN!” In 1974, The New York Times published the lyrics: “Win! Win! Win! We’ll win together, Win together, that’s, the true American way, today. Who needs inflation? Not this nation.”

But, of course, Biden is trying to offer the country a doctrine rather than a jingle.

Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson said the president wants to show the voters that he has plans and solutions for their troubles, not that he’s necessarily fixed everything.

“For 40 years people have been clamoring for an approach to the economy that puts working people at the center instead of prioritizing the wealthy and that’s what he’s delivering on,” Ferguson said. “So the story that he can tell is a different approach to the economy and the proof is in the pudding. It’s also so core to who he is. People believe he’s the guy who’d make the economy work as hard for working people as working people work for the economy.”

That’s likely because they have been left behind, especially native-born Americans.

This is perhaps most evident in figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If one looks only at the headline numbers in each monthly report, the economy appears to be off to the races. Nonfarm payrolls are up, and unemployment is down.

But few analysts have bothered asking questions like what kinds of jobs are being added to the economy, how much they pay, who has the jobs, or why the unemployment rate is so low.

The economy is not adding high-paying, full-time jobs that come with benefits. The number of full-time jobs was roughly flat over the last 12 months, so essentially all the job growth was part-time employment. As the layoffs mount, Americans are replacing their previous job with more than one part-time job.

>>> Americans in Crosshairs of Cost-of-Living Crisis

That increases the number of payrolls without increasing the number of people employed, which helps explain the unprecedented disparity between the two categories. The shift to lower-paying part-time employment has become so dramatic that it is dragging down average hourly wages.

In fact, December and January marked the biggest two-month decline in full-time employment since the government-imposed lockdowns of March and April 2020.

Aside from those losing their primary job, Americans are increasingly taking second or third jobs to make ends meet.

But even the BLS statistics on multiple job holders understate the extent of the problem. When a person gets a second job, that increases the number of multiple job holders. But when that person gets a third job, it doesn’t.

With 60% of Americans living from paycheck to paycheck, it’s no surprise that so many of them have gotten extra jobs as they rack up a record $1.1 trillion in credit card debt to cover necessities.

The low unemployment rate is also a facade as the pandemic recedes from the headlines, the product of over 5 million people missing from the labor force. The number of people not in the labor force was trending down before the lockdowns in early 2020, but it has remained elevated since then and is still above June 2020 levels.

Adding those missing workers back into the labor force yields an unemployment rate of over 6%. While not horrific, that percentage is common during recessions and shows that Americans are not faring as well as is being portrayed.

Yet the best explanation for Mr. Biden’s poor polling on the economy has to do with who is getting these millions of new jobs. It turns out they are not native-born Americans.

While last month’s job data quickly garnered hyperbolic terms like “blowout,” a fairer word would be depressing for many Americans. Native-born employment was not only a whopping 5.5 million below its pre-pandemic trend but was even 121,000 below its pre-pandemic level, or 0.1%.

>>> Home Prices: From American Dream to American Nightmare

Conversely, foreign-born employment was 2.8 million above its pre-pandemic level, or 10.3%, having returned to its pre-pandemic trend last year. It turns out all the job gains since the beginning of 2020 have gone to the foreign-born, while native-born Americans have actually lost jobs on net.

Even the BLS concedes that its figures reflect at least some illegal aliens working in America. With millions of such illegal aliens pouring across the southern border due to Biden administration policies, it makes sense that this would augment the workforce of foreign-born people here legally and boost employment numbers.

That native-born Americans have made no progress in terms of job numbers in four years is a key reason why they view the economy so poorly, but it isn’t the only one. Their inflation-adjusted weekly earnings are still down 4.2% under Mr. Biden, according to BLS estimates.

The reality is even worse because the BLS has grossly undercounted many price increases, such as the cost of homeownership. Using rental data, the BLS estimates this has risen by less than 20% in the last three years.

Conversely, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta uses real-world housing data to estimate that the cost of homeownership has risen 76.5% over the same time, or four times the official BLS metric.

It is surprisingly easy to square the circle of good economic headlines and lousy polling on the economy: The benefits of “Bidenomics” go to a few, and Americans as a whole come last.","(1, 'employment/wages')"

The U.S. economy is doing better. But President Joe Biden does not appear to be benefitting. His approval remains flat to declining. Biden has trailed Trump by about two percentage points consistently since October.

Many pundits ask: when will Biden start to benefit from an improving economy?

They are asking the wrong question. Presidential approval once corresponded to changing economic conditions. This link is now broken. It probably has been for two decades. Biden’s 2024 chances do not depend on the economy.

This is bad news for our democracy. It means that performance doesn’t matter for presidential incumbents. This undermines a fundamental premise of accountability.

This de-linking between economic performance and presidential approval follows from changes in partisanship and media. As the public has become more polarized, and media more fragmented, political reality has split into three: a Democratic Reality, a Republican Reality, and a Politically Disengaged Reality.

In the Democratic Reality, Democrats are the good people, and Republicans are the bad people. When a Democrat like Joe Biden is in the White House, the Democratic Reality has confidence in the administration. Biden and his administration deserve credit for the good news in the economy and the world more broadly. Bad news, like a rough economic patch, however, is not Biden’s fault. They are due to circumstances beyond his control, and he and his administration are doing the best they can.

Sometimes, Democratic Reality will be critical of Biden and his administration. But the starting premise in Democratic Reality is that Biden’s doing the best he can, and nobody is perfect. And good news should be shared and discussed widely. In Democratic Reality, Biden’s approval remains high. It has nothing to do with the economy.

In Republican Reality, Democrats are the enemy, and Republicans are the heroes. In Republican Reality, as long as Joe Biden is in the White House, America is at risk (though at risk of what depends on the day or week). If anything bad happens, it is clearly Biden’s fault. If anything good happens, it is in spite of Biden. But mostly, Republican Reality tries to ignore the good things that happen, and focus on all the bad things.

In Republican Reality, disapproval of Joe Biden is a first premise. The rest of reality must be made to fit that first premise. This means that among Republicans, approval of Joe Biden will always be in the single digits. The same can be said of any Democrat. It has nothing to do with the economy.

But there is also a third reality: The Politically Disengaged Reality. In this reality, politics and political events exist on the margins, only occasionally interjecting themselves into awareness. This is the reality where news comes through TikTok, Instagram, and other social media. It is a reality where other passions—pop culture, sports, video games, etc—dominate attention. It is a reality for people who don’t care about politics. Increasingly, it’s full of people who feel like the whole system is so corrupt and broken that there is no point in being engaged. There is plenty of evidence to suggest they might be right.

In Politically Disengaged Reality, little political news breaks through. Mostly it’s bad news, since bad news is stickier and more interesting than good news. Conflict also breaks through, since conflict is more interesting than compromise. Bad news and conflict also confirms the pre-existing expectations of those who inhabit this reality: that American politics is deeply broken. Nobody represents them; nobody cares about them. Strong anti-system vibes infuse this reality. I call the voters who inhabit this reality “Shrug Emoji Voters.”

These “Shrug Emoji Voters” sometimes vote, and sometimes don’t. They can be convinced to vote against a candidate they see as a major threat. And they might even get excited about a new candidate, especially a fresh new face (hope springs eternal). But fresh faces constantly disappoint. And once a politician disappoints, there are few second chances. Approval ratings steadily dry up among this group. Like a desert, very little will grow on barren soil once it cracks and craters. If the economy is doing better, they will be the last to know and attribute it to Joe Biden.

It wasn’t always this way. In an earlier era, the realities were much more overlapping because the parties themselves were more overlapping. We once had something more like a four-party system, with liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats, alongside conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats. More voters were open to at least supporting either party.

And the news environment was less fragmented. Most people read a local paper and a national news magazine, and they saw the same political news, more or less. They could give it a Republican spin or a Democratic spin, but it was still the same news. Even if you weren’t particularly interested in politics, you still had to get the local newspaper to read the sports scores or the movie listings. It was harder to avoid national political news because you still saw the front page, even if you skipped past it.

Now, Democrats and Republicans are more socially and geographically segregated than ever before, and this social and geographic segregation is amplified and exacerbated by the fragmented media landscape It is easier than ever to construct your own reality through À la carte media consumption.

It is also easier than ever to avoid political news altogether, and to thus remain completely ignorant of the state of the economy, or the state of the world. And it may be more rational to do so today, as well. Most of the news is bad. Especially in an era in which each individual article gets its own web-traffic stats, conflict-driven, emotional content is more prized than ever.

Tell me what you think about Joe Biden, and I’ll tell you what you’re going to think of the economy in October. If you like Biden, you’ll like the economy. If you don’t like Biden, you won’t like the economy. People already know what they think. They can now choose the reality to reflect what they already think. LOL. Nothing matters. Shrug.

The era of shared media is not coming back anytime soon. Our best hope lies in more overlapping partisan realities, through more political parties. With two separate partisan realities, the world splits apart. With multiple overlapping partisan realities, perspectives can shift. Different citizens can find different points of entry. We don’t have to agree on everything. But we should at least be able to agree that the world is complex, with multiple perspectives. When reality is bifurcated, politics becomes zero-sum and destructive. If our side is always good, and their side is always bad, the compromise necessary for a healthy democracy becomes impossible.","(0, 'GDP')"

Larry Summers, the former Obama and Clinton official, slammed parts of President Joe Biden’s economic agenda as “increasingly dangerous” this week, saying it could end up causing higher prices for Americans.

“I am profoundly concerned by the doctrine of manufacturing-centered economic nationalism that is increasingly put forth as a general principle to guide policy,” Summers said on Tuesday while speaking virtually at an event held by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

Specifically, Summers took issue with the administration’s trade stance, efforts to prop up US manufacturing and its antitrust crackdown. The former Harvard president argued this approach could prove to be inflationary.

“It is wrong to suppose that manufacturing-based economic nationalism is a route to higher incomes or better standards of living for the middle class,” Summers said.

“Bidenomics is a fundamental break from trickle-down economics, which underinvested in the American people and our competitiveness,” White House spokesperson Michael Kikukawa told CNN in a statement in response to the Summers criticism. “The pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine made clear that supply chains and critical resources can be easily disrupted, hurting consumers, workers, and the entire economy.”

The White House spokesperson added that Biden’s investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and semiconductors “are not just creating new factories and jobs, they are making our economy more resilient.”

Manufacturing on the rise

Biden has made reviving American manufacturing a central part of his economic agenda. Biden signed into law legislation that incentivizes domestic manufacturing around clean energy, computer chips and other areas.

The White House has hailed a surge in private investment in American manufacturing under Biden’s watch.

“It used to be: find the cheapest market in the world, send the job overseas, and bring the product back. Not on my watch. Right here, we’re doing — we’re creating jobs in America, and we’re exporting American products,” Biden said during a speech about “Bidenomics” in Philadelphia last month.

Booming manufacturing investment has helped boost the US economy, with Morgan Stanley economists citing that as a key reason for their brighter economic projections.

Summers said he agrees with a “large part of” what the administration has done, including the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act, which sought to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing.

“I believe those two signature items of Biden policies were appropriate steps,” Summers said.

Inflation concerns persist

However, the famed economist and former president emeritus of Harvard University, and former Secretary of the Treasury, is taking issue with the doctrine behind those policies.

“We do not have a problem of a shortfall of jobs,” Summers said, noting that the number of open jobs relative to people looking for work remains high. “We do have a problem of costs.”

High inflation has hurt workers by eating into their paychecks. Real wages, adjusted for inflation, have declined, making it harder for Americans to get by.

Summers argued that globalization and the reduction of trade barriers have helped consumers by lowering inflation and ushering in a period of low interest rates.

“That is why I am so concerned by the administration’s attitudes, or non-attitudes, toward trade,” he said.

On the antitrust front, last week the Biden administration released new guidelines that signal officials plan to continue a tough approach when it comes to stopping harmful mergers.

“Unchecked consolidation threatens the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based,” Attorney General Merrick Garland in a statement last week. “These updated merger guidelines respond to modern market realities and will enable the Justice Department to transparently and effectively protect the American people from the damage that anticompetitive mergers cause.”

Summers, however, argued that the new guidelines “discard” a long-standing focus on lowering consumer costs when it comes to antitrust actions.

“Yes, we should enforce the antitrust law more than we have over the last 30 years,” Summers said. “But we should do that in service of a doctrine of higher incomes through lower costs for consumers.”","(3, 'inflation')"

Under the leadership of President Biden and Senate Democrats, the American economy is coming back in a big way – the economy is growing far faster than expectations, inflation is going down, more families are seeing more money in their pockets, investment in American manufacturing is at a record high, and the American people are feeling better about the economy.

“A clear new pattern is emerging showing Americans are feeling more and more optimistic about the economy – and it’s not hard to see why,” said Leader Schumer. “After Democrats led passage of historic legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Infrastructure Law, American families are seeing more money in their pockets, more jobs, lower inflation, and higher wages. Unlike hard-right Republicans who stoke chaos and pursue partisan agendas, Senate Democrats and President Biden are taking America in the right direction.”

The investments Democrats that we made are starting to pay off for the American people – and we are just getting started. Thanks to legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Infrastructure Investment And Jobs Act, and more, communities across the country are seeing new and historic investments that will create good-paying jobs and grow our economy. This morning, Leader Schumer announced another investment in New York made possible by the CHIPS and Science Act. And last week, Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Senator Tammy Baldwin, (D-WI), and Senator Tina Smith (D-MN) stood with President Biden to announce a critical $1 billion investment to replace the Blatnik Bridge connecting Wisconsin and Minnesota.

National

West Long Branch, NJ – Just one-third of Americans feel they are benefitting from the current boom in the U.S. economy, a lower number than during the pre-Covid boom years. The Monmouth (“Mon-muth”) University Poll finds that just under half the public gives President Joe Biden credit for this upturn, but few say his policies are helping the middle class, especially compared to his predecessor. The poll also finds that disapproval of Congress has hit a nominal record for the past decade.

Recent economic indicators show the U.S. economy has been growing, including lower unemployment, higher productivity, and a high Dow Jones average. When asked about this economic upturn, about half of the public says Biden deserves credit for it (22% a great deal and 26% some credit) while half says he does not (14% not much and 36% not at all). Nine in 10 Democrats (89%) give the president at least some credit for the improving economy while just 1 in 10 Republicans (10%) say the same.

When asked whether their own family has been helped by this upturn, just one-third say they have personally benefited either a great deal (9%) or some (24%). At the opposite end of the spectrum, 40% of Americans say they have not benefited at all. These numbers were more positive when Monmouth asked this question before the pandemic. Between 2015 and 2019, the number of Americans who said their family benefited at least somewhat from national economic growth ranged from 39% (January 2015) to 50% (August 2018). Those who said they did not benefit at all was no higher than 29% (January 2015 and April 2018) and as low as 23% (January 2017).

Reports of how American families have been impacted by national economic growth has varied with partisanship over time. For example, the top-line results at the end of Barack Obama’s presidency and just past the halfway point in Donald Trump’s term were similar – 47% of the public reported at least some economic benefit in January 2017 and 43% said the same in April 2019. However, this overall stability masked significant partisan shifts between the two administrations. In the Obama era poll, 63% of Democrats said they were benefiting from national economic growth, while 42% of independents and 37% of Republicans said the same. Under Trump, just 27% of Democrats said they were benefiting from the economy, while it was higher among independents (44%) and especially Republicans (61%). According to the current poll, 61% of Democrats say they are benefiting from the economic growth during Biden’s term, but just 27% of independents and 14% of Republicans agree.

“When it comes to making a connection between the national economy and Americans’ own well-being, Biden is doing about as well as Obama did among his fellow Democrats and similar to how Trump performed among Republicans. The problem for Biden is he is doing decidedly worse than either of his two predecessors among independents,” said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute.

Looking at how Biden’s policies have affected different economic groups shows that 16% of Americans say middle-class families in general have benefited a lot, 21% say poor families have benefited a lot, and 41% say wealthy families have benefited a lot. Conversely, 45% say middle-class families have not benefited at all from Biden’s policies, 40% say the same about poor families and 19% say the same about wealthy families. Compared to prior Monmouth polling, there has been some improvement for Biden on these numbers for middle-class and poor families, but the biggest difference has been in perceptions of how wealthy families have been affected. The number who say the wealthy have been helped a lot rose by 13 percentage points since 2022. Perceptions of how Biden has helped wealthy families is not quite as high as it was for Trump during his term (58% said the wealthy were benefiting a lot in 2019). More importantly, though, Biden’s numbers are slightly worse than Trump’s when it comes to helping middle-class families. About the same number say the middle class has been helped a lot by Biden as said the same for Trump in 2019 (18%), but the number who feel this group has not been helped at all is nine points higher for Biden than it was for his predecessor (36%). Also, when it comes to helping poor families, Biden does better than Trump, but much worse than Obama.

“The administration can beat the drum on all sorts of positive economic news. From the standpoint of Biden’s presidential campaign, however, if voters don’t think this bounty is reaching the middle class then that can become the economic ‘fact’ which matters most,” said Murray.

Public opinion of Biden’s overall job performance currently stands at 38% approve and 58% disapprove. This represents a slight improvement from Monmouth’s December poll which marked an all-time low for Biden since taking office (34% approve and 61% disapprove), but it continues an overall negative trend since last summer. Biden’s job rating went from net positive to net negative in the fall of 2021 and continued to worsen into the summer of 2022. It slowly started to rebound through the remainder of the year, but then grew more negative after January 2023 when he held a 43% approve and 48% disapprove rating. Currently, 79% of Democrats give Biden a positive job rating, but only 29% of independents and just 4% of Republicans do the same.

A majority of Americans disapprove of the way Biden has handled five different policy areas, while he earns a split decision on employment. Specifically, 48% approve and 49% disapprove of his handling of jobs and unemployment. This is somewhat better than his 42% approve and 53% disapprove rating on this policy area in December. The president’s policy ratings are more negative on transportation and energy infrastructure (43% approve, 53% disapprove) and climate change (41% approve, 53% disapprove). He gets decidedly poor ratings on handling inflation (34% approve, 63% disapprove), foreign policy (33% approve, 65% disapprove), and immigration (26% approve, 71% disapprove).

Biden’s approval number on inflation is six points better than in December (28%), while he has inched up 3 points on climate change (from 38%). His approval ratings on infrastructure and immigration are basically the same as they were two months ago (at 42% and 26%, respectively). Foreign policy was not asked in the December poll.

Among independents, 45% give Biden positive marks on handling jobs and unemployment, while 33% each approve of his performance on infrastructure and climate change. At least 8 in 10 Democrats approve of Biden’s handling of these three issues, while fewer than 1 in 10 Republicans say the same. Among Democrats, 71% approve of how Biden has handled inflation, 65% approve of his foreign policy efforts, and a bare majority (54%) approve of his work on immigration. No more than 1 in 4 independents and very few Republicans approve of Biden’s handling of these three issues.

On another topic, the U.S. Congress receives an abysmal job rating of 14% approve and 79% disapprove. This disapproval level is nominally the worst congressional rating since Monmouth started asking this question nationally in 2013. The current result just edges out statistically similar 78% disapproval ratings recorded in both June 2022 and August 2016. The current poll’s congressional approval rating matches the prior record low of 14% (from August 2016 and July 2013). Disapproval of Congress is widespread across all partisan groups, including 82% of Republicans, 82% of independents, and 74% of Democrats.

“One thing that Americans of all partisan stripes seem to agree upon is that Congress is broken,” said Murray.

In other poll results, Vice President Kamala Harris receives a job rating of 35% approve and 58% disapprove, which is basically unchanged from polls taken since the fall. Only 17% of the public says the country is going in the right direction, while 69% say it is on the wrong track. Democrats are split between saying the country is heading in the right (36%) or wrong (40%) direction, while nearly all Republicans (95%) and most independents (73%) feel things have gotten off on the wrong track.

The Monmouth University Poll was conducted by telephone from February 8 to 12, 2024 with 902 adults in the United States. The question results in this release have a margin of error of +/- 4.1 percentage points for the full sample. The poll was conducted by the Monmouth University Polling Institute in West Long Branch, NJ.

METHODOLOGY

The Monmouth University Poll was sponsored and conducted by the Monmouth University Polling Institute from February 8 to 12, 2024 with a probability-based national random sample of 902 adults age 18 and older. Interviews were conducted in English, and included 183 live landline telephone interviews, 362 live cell phone interviews, and 357 online surveys via a cell phone text invitation. Telephone numbers were selected through a mix of random digit dialing and list-based sampling. Landline respondents were selected with a modified Troldahl-Carter youngest adult household screen. Interviewing services were provided by Braun Research, with sample obtained from Dynata (RDD, n= 557), Aristotle (list, n= 152) and a panel of prior Monmouth poll participants (n= 193). Monmouth is responsible for all aspects of the survey design, data weighting and analysis. The full sample is weighted for region, age, education, gender and race based on US Census information (ACS 2021 one-year survey). For results based on this sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling has a maximum margin of plus or minus 4.1 percentage points adjusted for sample design effects (1.56). Sampling error can be larger for sub-groups (see table below). In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls.

Demographics (weighted)

Party (self-reported): 28% Republican, 40% Independent, 32% Democrat

Sex: 48% male, 51% female, 1% other

Age: 29% 18-34, 33% 35-54, 38% 55+

191,Biden aims to repair places left broken by previous economic strategies - The Washington Post,Biden aims to repair places left broken by previous economic strategies  The Washington Post,"Wed, 13 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDI0LzAzLzEzL2JpZGVuLWVjb25vbXktbWlsd2F1a2VlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Washington Post,"MILWAUKEE — President Biden, speaking Wednesday in a community that he cited as a painful example of racist urban policy, highlighted a new economic strategy aimed at revitalizing places that for decades have been cut off from the nation’s growing prosperity. Biden spoke at a Boys and Girls Club of Greater Milwaukee in a largely Black and Latino neighborhood where 17,000 homes and 1,000 businesses were destroyed in the 1960s to make way for an interstate highway. The president’s trip, which includes a stop in Michigan on Thursday, is part of an effort to court minority voters in states that are key to his political future.

In conjunction with the Midwestern swing, the White House unveiled $3.3 billion in federal grants to remove or retrofit highways that separate minority neighborhoods in many cities from jobs, entertainment centers, hospitals and other services.

“Too many communities across America faced the loss of land, wealth and possibilities that still reverberate today,” Biden said. “Today we’re recognizing that history to make new history.”

Milwaukee is one of 132 communities in 40 states that will benefit from the Transportation Department program, which is among a number of new federal initiatives designed to aid places suffering long-term economic ills, officials said.

“For communities too often left behind, we’re rebuilding the roads, we’re repairing cracks in the sidewalk,” Biden said. “We’re creating places to live and play safely and to breathe clean air.”

Biden’s embrace of strategies aimed at spurring development in specific locations marks a significant shift in U.S. policy, part of the broadest government intervention in the economy in at least four decades and one with significant political overtones. States such as Wisconsin are critical to Democratic hopes in November, and Biden’s appeal to Milwaukee’s large number of Black voters may decide his fate there.

The administration’s “place-based” approach aims to use a mix of spending and tax credits to spread prosperity more evenly, rebuild communities devastated by the loss of factory jobs and prevent blight in areas that otherwise would suffer during the transition to cleaner energy sources.

If it succeeds, the effort could in theory help heal an economic divide that has fueled political resentment and convinced millions of Americans that Washington has abandoned them to decay.

“People and capital are trapped in places where the prospects are not that good,” said Simon Johnson, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “This is a big country with a lot of space. Let’s have economic development where people want it.”

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, previewing the program earlier in the week, told reporters that “the very fact that American English has the phrase ‘wrong side of the tracks’ tells you everything you need to know about our awareness in this country of how infrastructure can divide just as sure as it can connect.”

But in seeking to focus federal power on reviving downtrodden communities, the president is gambling on a set of policies with a mixed track record. Even its supporters acknowledge that Washington may struggle to sustain the decades-long effort that some distressed areas would require to heal.

“This is just not something that happens overnight. We should be thinking of this in a multigenerational context,” said John Lettieri, chief executive of the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan think tank that, among other things, focuses on economically distressed areas.

The political stakes for Biden’s visit to Milwaukee were also evident. His campaign announced this week that it was basing its Wisconsin operation in Milwaukee, the most racially diverse city in the state, part of an effort to consolidate the coalition that helped Biden win Wisconsin by nearly 21,000 votes in 2020.

Biden has made addressing racial inequity a key aspect of his presidency, and now his reelection bid. He was elected in 2020, after the killing of George Floyd, amid calls for criminal justice, education and policing reforms.

Biden, facing energetic opposition from Republicans, has failed to push through several bills of widespread importance to Black Americans and other minority groups. There has been no sweeping police and criminal justice reform, and efforts to codify voting protections into federal law died in Congress. Biden did sign an executive order in 2022 aimed at preventing and punishing police misconduct.

His aides say the administration has delivered other gains, including historic appointments to the courts, including that of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, and the selection of Vice President Harris as the first Black and Asian American woman in her role. Biden has also said that equity is baked into individual provisions of laws like the Inflation Reduction Act.

On Wednesday, he stressed his initiatives that have disproportionately benefited Black Americans, everything from capping the price of insulin for Medicare recipients to increasing the Black employment rate. Former president Donald Trump and his Republican allies, Biden said, are trying to undo much of the progress his administration had made in recent years.

Even as he battles for political support, the president is also intent on cementing his economic legacy. His industrial policies, including the place-based efforts, have reoriented Washington toward a more active economic role.

About 20 individual programs in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Inflation Reduction Act and the Chips and Science Act are likely to sprinkle tens of billions of dollars across the economy over the next half-decade, the largest such geographically focused effort in years.

“This is a sea change,” said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

Many of the programs, especially those aimed at promoting domestic semiconductor production, enjoy bipartisan support. But lawmakers have not always fully funded them.

The Chips Act, for example, authorized $10 billion in funding over five years to establish 31 tech hubs in communities across the country, an effort to promote technology development outside Silicon Valley and other longtime industry centers.

But lawmakers ultimately appropriated just $500 million for the hubs. In October, the Commerce Department named sites in 32 states as eligible to apply to receive the first implementation grants of $40 million to $70 million each.

Economists long favored targeting people rather than places for government help. But that began to change as the shared growth of the immediate post-World War II era gave way to a more uneven pattern. Some hard-hit areas — like former coal-mining towns and factory communities in the Midwest — have now suffered for years with low employment rates and chronic social ills.

Wednesday’s presidential visit to Milwaukee was part of an all-hands-on-deck administration effort to promote Biden’s economic policies, as the president faces pressure to improve his poll numbers in coming months. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen, for example, traveled to Elizabethtown, Ky., visiting Advanced Nano Products, a maker of materials used in electric-vehicle batteries.

White House officials distinguish Biden’s approach from what they call the failed “trickle-down” policies of the past. Emphasizing low tax rates and deregulation, while trusting the market to allocate capital to worthy projects, resulted in growth that was markedly lopsided, they said.

An approach centered instead on leveraging the advantages of specific communities will narrow the regional divide in economic outcomes, the officials contend. Over the past few decades, as innovative technologies drove growth, jobs and wealth have become more concentrated in a few coastal cities while other areas languished.

Between 2005 and 2017, according to Brookings, about 90 percent of all high-tech jobs sprouted in five metro areas: Boston, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle and San Diego.

Americans who once routinely moved in search of opportunity also became significantly less mobile as the high cost of housing in job-rich places often made relocation prohibitively expensive.

In 2022, just 8.7 percent of Americans moved — close to an all-time low and down from more than 20 percent in the mid-1980s, according to the Census Bureau.

“The market failure, we think, is pretty clear,” said a White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the initiative before it was formally announced.

Biden’s approach seeks to help downtrodden communities by improving outdated roads, bridges and telecom connections; attracting private funds to invest alongside the government; and eliminating physical barriers to opportunities, such as the interstate highways that were plowed through many African American neighborhoods in the 1950s and 1960s.

Officials say they intend to “stack” or combine multiple federal initiatives in individual locations in hopes of overwhelming entrenched problems. In a recent speech, the director of the National Economic Council, Lael Brainard, cited Milwaukee and Allentown, Pa., as evidence of early success.

These place-based strategies echo moments from the nation’s past, such as President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s 1933 legislation establishing the Tennessee Valley Authority, which spurred regional development with electrification and flood control. In the 1960s, the Appalachian Regional Commission helped spur highway construction across one of the nation’s poorest areas.

“TVA and ARC both worked. Of course, they were a sizable amount of resources,” said Tim Bartik, senior economist with the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research.","(2, 'housing')"
193,"AP-NORC poll finds an uptick in positive ratings of the US economy, but it's not boosting Biden - The Associated Press","AP-NORC poll finds an uptick in positive ratings of the US economy, but it's not boosting Biden  The Associated Press","Thu, 01 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2JpZGVuLXBvbGwtc3VydmV5LWVjb25vbXktdHJ1bXAtZWxlY3Rpb24tZGNhMWI2MGY2NzQ5ZDVlYjUwYmMwZTc2MDA4MTQ4NTXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Associated Press,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Stocks are near record highs. Growth was surprisingly strong last year. And once-hot inflation has begun to cool. But so far, U.S. adults are feeling only slightly better about the economy.

A new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that 35% of U.S. adults call the national economy good. That’s an uptick from 30% who said so late last year and up from 24% who said so a year ago. While 65% still call the economy poor, that’s also an improvement from a year ago, when 76% called it poor.

Voters’ confidence in the economy could be a pivotal factor in this year’s presidential election as it is consistently rated as a top issue. Recent data on the economy has shown that growth accelerated last year even as inflation returned closer to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, proving wrong a multitude of Wall Street and academic economists who said a recession would be the consequence of efforts to lower inflation.

President Joe Biden and his aides have taken to highlighting the economic positives as consumer sentiment has rebounded. Biden is also drawing an open contrast with former President Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner. Trump supporters remember his tenure with pride for how the economy fared, but his term was marred by job losses tied to the coronavirus pandemic.

The evidence of a stronger economy has yet to spill over into greater support for Biden. The new poll puts his approval rating at 38%, which is roughly where that number has stood for most of the past two years. Biden’s approval rating on handling the economy is similar, at 35%.

Respondents interviewed for the survey often expressed their views on the economy through a personal lens. Some judged it based on their grocery bills and prices at the gasoline pump. Others assessed the economy based on their appreciating investments. Housing prices mattered, and so did job prospects for their adult children and the upward trajectory of the federal debt.

Molly Kapsner, 58, lives on a farm in Wisconsin and thinks the economy is doing “pretty well” because she has three children finishing college this year and all of them have job options. She voted for Biden in 2020 and plans to do so again.

“He has a lot on his plate right now and he’s doing quite well,” she said. “He’s just putting his head down and doing his job and not trying to create a circus in our country.”

David Veksler, who voted for the libertarian candidate, Jo Jorgenson, in 2020, said he’s worried about the rising federal debt. The 43-year-old software engineer manager from Denver said the borrowing will hurt growth in the long term, even if his investments are doing well now.

“I think he’s similar to his predecessors in furthering unsustainable deficits,” Veksler said of Biden. “I’m as negative on him as I was on Trump.”

Harry Broadnax, a 62-year-old retiree, said he increasingly thinks about the economy in relation to the increase in migrants illegally crossing the U.S. southern border. He feels their presence is diverting financial resources from U.S. citizens.

“I would like to see them block up the border like Trump wanted,” said Broadnax, who is from North Carolina, adding for emphasis, “I’m a Democrat.”

Broadnax doesn’t see himself voting for Biden or Trump, whose criminal indictments worry him.

The Biden administration has tried to put a greater focus on the big numbers used to assess the overall economy, making its case through hard data.

Lael Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council, told a group of reporters last week that skeptics about the economy had overlooked how Biden’s policies boosted the labor market and repaired supply chains wrecked by the pandemic.

“The big miss here was not to understand how much, by surging back into the workforce, by addressing supply chains that were completely broken, those inflationary pressures would come down,” she said.

Trump has said that the economy is “fragile” and “running off the fumes of what we did.” The Republican front-runner has said on social media that stocks are rising because he is likely to return to the White House. That claim overlooks the influence of the Fed, as well as the fact that average annual growth has been higher under Biden so far than it was during Trump’s term.

There continues to be a political split in how people think about the economy. As a consequence, there might be a limit on how much Biden’s approval numbers can climb even if the economy keeps thriving as it did last year.

Democrats remain far more likely than Republicans to describe the economy as good, 58% to 15%. Still, views have improved at least slightly since the same time last year, when 41% of Democrats and 8% of Republicans called the economy good.

Sixty-five percent of Democrats, but just 7% of Republicans, say they approve of Biden’s handling of the economy, both largely unchanged since late last year.

However, the poll did show a brighter outlook on the economy from some key voter demographics. Since a year ago, a disproportionate increase in sentiment has come from college graduates and older adults — two groups that tend to turn out to vote at higher rates. There is also the possibility that voters will care more about the personalities of the Democratic and Republican nominees than they do about the state of the economy.

Deborah Shields, 70, who works in direct sales, said she’s noticed an improvement in the economy as her investments have improved. Yet she said her opposition to Trump will determine her vote in November.

“I would never, never, ever vote for Trump,” said Shields, who lives in Orlando, Florida. “He’s a megalomaniac.”

Richard Tunnell, an Air Force veteran on disability, voted for Trump in 2020 and would do so again if the former president is on the ballot. The 30-year-old from Huntsville, Texas is a hard “no” on Biden.

“He’s just a puppet,” Tunnell said. “They’ll boot people out like Trump who give a crap, but they’ll put in people like Biden who they can put on strings and manipulate.”

However, President Joe Biden is unlikely to measure his own achievements by the gyrations of the stock market, economic experts say — and that message is likely to resonate with an anxious population.

“I doubt Joe Biden views the stock market as a barometer of his immediate success,"" said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. ""He is focused on the health and welfare of Americans. He will gauge success on how much he can flatten the curve, prevent deaths and get the economy back in shape.""

For much of Trump's presidency, it was easy for him to claim credit for stock gains, since he was set up for success, economists say.

“The economy was in pretty good shape. Nothing was really out of balance,” said Dan North, chief economist for North America at Euler Hermes.

Corporate expectations of lower taxes and fewer regulations sent business optimism soaring. “It was the right environment to go up. The Biden stock market has an awful lot going against it,” North said.

The Biden stock market has an awful lot going against it.""

Last March 9 and again on March 12, as the coronavirus began to take over the country, stocks fell so far, so fast, that electronic “circuit breakers” had to be triggered to stave off a full-blown collapse. That weekend, Trump tweeted, “BIGGEST STOCK MARKET RISE IN HISTORY YESTERDAY!” while saying nothing to address, or even acknowledge, the nation’s growing economic fears. The following week, circuit breakers were again triggered on two different days as stocks continued to slide.

The CARES Act, along with aggressive action from the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates and add liquidity to the financial system, ultimately stopped the market’s fall. In the ensuing months, Wall Street recovered, while Main Street suffered.

Experts say this is just one example of why it was not only pointless, but foolhardy, for Trump to claim credit for a rising market. “In the investment business, generally speaking, we know that the things that make the stock market move are myriad and complex. It’s difficult, at best, to gauge cause and effect,” Martin said.

Despite his self-professed business acumen, Trump squandered some of the market momentum he was handed, analysts say. “He did quite a few things to really impede the progress of the stock market,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at the Independent Advisor Alliance. “The trade war with China was, by far, the most detrimental.”

That trade war was widely regarded as a failure: It drew to an uneasy truce in early 2020, with little gained for American consumers or businesses.

The new president, on the other hand, faces a heavier lift. “President Trump is handing Biden an economy in shambles, still down nearly 10 million jobs from its pre-pandemic peak and struggling to avoid a double-dip recession,” Moody’s Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi wrote in a research note earlier this week.

“Whereas you might say what Trump inherited was a 'normal market,' Joe Biden is inheriting a market that’s at extremes,” Martin said. “You just have a whole new ballgame for Joe Biden.”

Valuations are high, inflation is broadly low but shows pockets of escalation, and market observers say Wall Street seems to be positioned for a best-case scenario regarding Covid-19 containment and immunity. Anything that doesn’t live up to the market’s lofty expectations could trigger a reversal in investor sentiment.

“If you're the average person, do you care if GDP was 3.2 or 3.4 percent? No, you care if you have a job.”

If the market does drop from its current highs, though, economists don’t expect Biden to respond the way his predecessor might have. Unlike Trump, Biden is more likely to focus on containing Covid-19 and getting the sputtering labor market recovery going again. “The Biden administration, I think, is going to focus more on the unemployment rate and jobs and less on what the actual stock market may do,” said Megan Horneman, director of portfolio strategy at Verdence Capital Advisors. “Right now, our immediate problem is still the coronavirus and getting the economy reopened.”

North said: “It’s going to take a long time to get those 10 million jobs back, particularly because there's been so much permanent business closure. That's what I believe the administration will focus on and, honestly, should focus on.""

President Biden’s approval ratings have remained low since earlier this summer, with 42% approving of his handling of his job as president overall and just 36% approving of his handling of the economy. Forty-two percent also rate his handling of foreign policy as good. The AP-NORC poll conducted in June found similar results: 41% approved of his overall job performance and 34% approved of his handling of the economy.

Among Democrats, 65% approve of Biden’s handling of the economy and 76% approve of how he’s handling his job as president overall, but approval is much lower among younger Democrats. Just 52% of Democrats under age 45 approve of how he is handling the economy, while 77% of older adults approve. And only 68% of Democrats under 45 rate his handling of his job as good compared to 84% of those older than 45.

When it comes to Biden’s ability to effectively perform key functions of the presidency, a majority of the public has hardly any confidence in his ability to reduce corruption in the government, and many have similar views regarding his ability to manage the White House, handle a crisis or achieve major policy goals.

In addition to having low confidence in Biden’s abilities, the public largely opposes him running for president again in 2024, with only 24% saying they would want him to do so. Despite viewing Biden’s job performance positively, over half of Democrats (55%) do not want Biden to run for president in 2024, although 82% say they would support him if he were the nominee. Younger Democrats are much more likely to be against him seeking re-election, with 66% of those under the age of 45 saying they would not want him to run again compared to 45% of those older than 45. However, 77% of young Democrats still report they would most likely support Biden if we were selected as the party’s nominee.

Overall, the public’s perception of the direction of the country remains pessimistic, as does their view of the economy. Seventy-four percent of the public believes the country is heading in the wrong direction, and just 34% describe the economy as good. However, Democrats have a more optimistic view of the economy than Republicans (52% vs. 15%).

The nationwide poll was conducted August 10-14, 2023 using the AmeriSpeak® Panel, the probability-based panel of NORC at the University of Chicago. Online and telephone interviews using landlines and cell phones were conducted with 1,165 adults. The margin of sampling error is +/- 3.8 percentage points.

The Montgomery Locks and Dam near Pittsburgh is in the midst of a $857 million upgrade to ensure water levels in the Upper Ohio River are high enough for large cargo ships to pass through.

On a grassy roadside nearby, a white sign announces who’s behind the work: “Project funded by President Joe Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.”

For Biden, taking credit for an improving economy — including the jobs and growth made possible by the trillion-dollar public works law — has become a political imperative, one that will help determine whether he is reelected to a second term next year. Even as Democrats relish a recent hot streak of positive economic data, they acknowledge it won’t benefit Biden politically unless voters begin to associate him with the improvements.

The White House office responsible for the infrastructure signage says there will be hundreds of thousands of signs claiming credit for projects made possible by the 2021 law, many of which are just now getting started. The same sign is posted near a road improvement project in Wisconsin and a border crossing in Arizona. Even where the work isn’t obvious, there are signs. At a large empty field in Montana, a sign announces a Superfund site is being cleaned up thanks to the law.

It’s all now collected under the banner of “Bidenomics,” the blanket term adopted by the White House to take ownership of an improving economy ahead of the 2024 election.

Despite the improvement, polls continue to show wide disapproval of how Biden has handled the economy, to the frustration of the White House and its Democratic allies. Even as inflation slows, wages rise, hiring continues apace and recession fears ease, many Americans are still pessimistic about the economy and blame the president.

“It’s understandable that Americans’ perception of the economy operates with somewhat of a lag to real economic data,” said Brian Deese, who until February served as director of Biden’s National Economic Council. “The recent uptick in consumer sentiment is promising and heartening. If we continue to see progress in that direction, I would expect it would start to flow through more clearly into approval numbers as well.”

Progress in changing Americans’ sour economic perceptions has so far been slow. About half of Americans think the economy is still in a downturn and getting worse, according to a CNN poll released Thursday. Only 37% approve of Biden’s handling of the economy – a figure that has held roughly steady since last fall.

Three-quarters of Americans describe economic conditions in the country as poor, according to the CNN poll – despite better than expected economic growth, and experts from the Federal Reserve to Goldman Sachs to Bank of America now saying a recession is no longer likely in the next year.

Voters have more concerns, though, than just their bank accounts. Biden’s age continues to worry voters, according to polls. Enthusiasm for a second Biden term remains low among Democrats. And the national mood has been dampened by years of political and economic turmoil.

“Post Covid, people are in a bad mood. They’re not very convinced and optimistic about anything because there’s a level of PTSD, certain level of depression,” a Democratic strategist said. “It’s not because of Joe Biden. It’s just because of the times.”

On Friday, government data showed the economy added 187,000 jobs in July, slightly lower than expected but still a sign of robust hiring. The report showed the unemployment rate ticking down to 3.5%, near a historic low.

The jobs report is the latest in a string of positive economic data. Last week, government figures showed the economy grew at a 2.4% rate in the April-through-June period, a faster pace than in the first three months of the year and well above economists’ expectations.

Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan rose 13% in July, the second straight month of improvement. And wages are now rising faster than prices.

White House aides acknowledge it will take time both for Americans to start feeling the effects of a stronger economy and to associate Biden with those improvements. But they see recent data as encouraging tailwinds.

“We’re finally getting the kind of clouds-clearing that we need for people to actually hear that message and see what we’re doing,” a senior administration official said. “I think communication in this day and age is always tough, it’s a fractured media environment. And that makes it even more necessary for us to keep repeating it.”

Speaking in Maine last week, Biden suggested Republicans were looking elsewhere for attack lines — including investigations of his family — now that economic conditions were improving.

“Republicans may have to find something else to criticize me for now that inflation is coming down. Maybe they’ll decide to impeach me because it’s coming down,” he said at a textile factory in Auburn, the signs behind him all labeled “Bidenomics: Made in America.”

What might serve as a laugh line for Democrats is rooted in some reality: Even significant economic improvements may not shift political winds in an increasingly partisan climate. CNN’s July polling found 70% of Democrats approved of Biden’s handling of the economy, compared to just 5% of Republicans. And while increased optimism was apparent among respondents who identified as Democrats, an overwhelming majority of Republicans were still pessimistic.

“There is a tough set of questions around, ‘Are there structural factors at play that will make it more challenging for POTUS to convince voters that the gains are under his stewardship?’” a former senior administration official said.

Biden’s advisers believe the attempt to brand the president’s economic accomplishments has been working — slowly, they acknowledge — to shift perceptions of his record, citing the uptick in consumer sentiment. Yet Biden’s economic approval remains anemic, meaning the effort that began earlier this summer with podium speeches at shipyards, factories and plants around the country will continue into the fall.

Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and several other top administration officials launched another travel blitz this week – that will include stops by the president next week in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah – highlighting key legislative accomplishments and touting positive economic data across the country.

So far, the administration has leaned on its own Cabinet to deliver its message. But Biden should take a page from the playbook of President Barack Obama, another former official said, and leverage private-sector executives to talk up the economy.

“The Biden surrogate playbook doesn’t exist,” the former official said, suggesting leaders from manufacturing, clean energy and semiconductor industries could be effective cheerleaders for Biden’s policies and the investments they’ve spurred.

Obama faced similarly negative economic perceptions at a similar point in his first term, but the economy was in much worse shape. Only 26% of Americans approved of his handling of the economy in August 2011, a month in which unemployment stood at 9.1% and the US economy created zero jobs.

He went on to handily win reelection the following year.

“Obama had to change people’s minds about where he started from and the bad hand that he was dealt and what he did to improve the economy, and Biden has that story on steroids,” the Democratic strategist said. “He has a story about turning the economy around no president has.”

White House aides and advisers acknowledge there’s still time for that story to change, for momentum to slow, or for new risks to appear.

“The bottom line is, we don’t have a history of looking at economic cycles that follow global pandemics, that follow major shocks to our supply chains and our energy markets because of geopolitical forces,” another current senior administration official said. “There’s a lot that’s unusual about this economic cycle.”

With 15 months until Election Day, the Biden administration remains most focused on sustaining the momentum – and the message.

“I think they’re pretty comfortable playing the long-ish game on this,” the first former senior administration official said. “They are asking themselves the question, ‘Where are we going to be a year from now?’”","(4, 'national debt')"

The global economy is in a synchronized slowdown and we are, once again, downgrading growth for 2019 to 3 percent, its slowest pace since the global financial crisis. Growth continues to be weakened by rising trade barriers and increasing geopolitical tensions. We estimate that the US-China trade tensions will cumulatively reduce the level of global GDP by 0.8 percent by 2020. Growth is also being weighed down by country-specific factors in several emerging market economies, and by structural forces, such as low productivity growth and aging demographics in advanced economies.

In the October World Economic Outlook, we are projecting a modest improvement in global growth to 3.4 percent in 2020, another downward revision of 0.2 percent from our April projections. However, unlike the synchronized slowdown, this recovery is not broad-based and remains precarious.

The weakness in growth is driven by a sharp deterioration in manufacturing activity and global trade, with higher tariffs and prolonged trade policy uncertainty damaging investment and demand for capital goods. In addition, the automobile industry is contracting owing also to a variety of factors, such as disruptions from new emission standards in the euro area and China that have had durable effects. Overall, trade volume growth in the first half of 2019 has fallen to 1 percent, the weakest level since 2012.

We are downgrading growth for 2019 to 3 percent, its slowest pace since the global financial crisis.

In contrast to extremely weak manufacturing and trade, the services sector continues to hold up almost across the globe. This has kept labor markets buoyant and wage growth and consumption spending healthy in advanced economies. There are, however, some initial signs of softening in the services sector in the United States and euro area.

Monetary policy has played a significant role in supporting growth. In the absence of inflationary pressures and facing weakening activity, major central banks have appropriately eased to reduce downside risks to growth and to prevent de-anchoring of inflation expectations. In our assessment, in the absence of such monetary stimulus, global growth would be lower by 0.5 percentage points in both 2019 and 2020.

Advanced economies continue to slow towards their lower long-term potential. Growth has been downgraded to 1.7 percent for 2019 (compared to 2.3 percent in 2018) and it is projected to stay at this level in 2020. Strong labor market conditions and policy stimulus are helping to offset the negative impact from weaker external demand for these economies.

Growth in emerging market and developing economies has also been revised down to 3.9 percent for 2019 (compared to 4.5 percent in 2018) owing in part to trade and domestic policy uncertainties, and to a structural slowdown in China.

The uptick in global growth for 2020 is driven by emerging market and developing economies that are projected to experience a growth rebound to 4.6 percent. About half of this rebound is driven by recoveries or shallower recessions in stressed emerging markets, such as Argentina, Iran, and Turkey, and the rest by recoveries in countries where growth slowed significantly in 2019 relative to 2018, such as Brazil, India, Mexico, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. There is, however, considerable uncertainty surrounding these recoveries, especially when major economies like the United States, Japan, and China are expected to slow further into 2020.

Escalating risks

In addition, there are several downside risks to growth. Heightened trade and geopolitical tensions, including Brexit-related risks, could further disrupt economic activity, and derail an already fragile recovery in emerging market economies and the euro area. This could lead to an abrupt shift in risk sentiment, financial disruptions, and a reversal in capital flows to emerging market economies. In advanced economies, low inflation could become entrenched and constrain monetary policy space further into the future, limiting its effectiveness.

Policies to reignite growth

To rejuvenate growth, policymakers must undo the trade barriers put in place with durable agreements, rein in geopolitical tensions, and reduce domestic policy uncertainty. Such actions can help boost confidence and reinvigorate investment, manufacturing, and trade. In this regard, we look forward to more details on the recent tentative deal reached between China and the United States. We welcome any steps to de-escalate tensions and to roll back recent trade measures, particularly if they can provide a path towards a comprehensive and lasting deal.

To fend off other risks to growth and to raise potential output, economic policy should support activity in a more balanced manner. Monetary policy cannot be the only game in town. It should be coupled with fiscal support where fiscal space is available, and policy is not already too expansionary. Countries like Germany and the Netherlands should take advantage of low borrowing rates to invest in social and infrastructure capital, even from a pure cost-benefit perspective. If growth were to deteriorate more severely, an internationally coordinated fiscal response, tailored to country circumstances, may be required.

While monetary easing has supported growth, it is essential that effective macroprudential regulation be deployed today to prevent mispricing of risk and excessive buildup of financial vulnerabilities.

For sustainable growth, it is important that countries undertake structural reforms to boost productivity, improve resilience, and lower inequality. Reforms in emerging market and developing economies are also more effective when good governance is already in place.

The global outlook remains precarious with a synchronized slowdown and uncertain recovery. At 3 percent growth, there is no room for policy mistakes and an urgent need for policymakers to support growth. The global trading system needs to be improved, not abandoned. Countries need to work together because multilateralism remains the only solution to tackling major issues, such as risks from climate change, cybersecurity risks, tax avoidance and tax evasion, and the opportunities and challenges of emerging financial technologies.","(0, 'GDP')"

by Patrick Canning and Rosanna Mentzer Morrison

Highlights: Low-income participants in USDA’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) generally spend their benefits soon after receiving them, spending that has cascading effects throughout the economy.

A recent ERS analysis finds that during a slowing economy, $1 billion in new SNAP benefits would lead to an increase of $1.54 billion in Gross Domestic Product (GDP)—54 percent above and beyond the new benefits.

The $1 billion in new SNAP benefits would generate an additional $32 million in income for the U.S. agriculture industries and support an additional 480 full-time agriculture jobs.

USDA’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the Nation’s largest food assistance program. In fiscal year 2018, SNAP served an average 40.3 million people per month and issued $60.9 billion in benefits to be spent in food stores authorized to accept SNAP benefits. The primary goal of SNAP is to provide low-income households with additional resources for buying food.

But SNAP also serves as an automatic stabilizer for the economy. For example, during an economic downturn, when unemployment increases and wages fall, more individuals become eligible for SNAP and enroll in the program. As SNAP participants spend this increased Federal assistance, income is generated for those involved in producing, transporting, and marketing the food and other goods purchased by SNAP recipients. The impact of this increased spending by SNAP households “multiplies” throughout the economy as the businesses supplying the food and other goods—and their employees—have additional funds to make purchases of their own. This multiplier effect on the economy may extend well beyond the initial money provided to SNAP participants.

Although the multiplier theory is well known, the size of the multiplier from increased SNAP benefits is less clear. A recent ERS study examined the multiplier impact of a hypothetical $1 billion increase in SNAP benefits and found that this expansion of benefits during a slowing economy would increase Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by $1.54 billion and support 13,560 jobs, including nearly 500 agricultural jobs (farming, forestry, fishing, and hunting). The expanded benefits would also boost income in the agriculture industries by $32 million.

Higher SNAP Benefits Expand Spending on Food and Other Goods

The size of the multiplier for any kind of government assistance, or spending, depends on how much of the assistance is spent and on what. Previous research concludes that reasonable estimates for the government spending multiplier under general economic conditions range from 0.8 to 1.5, meaning that $1 of additional government spending increases GDP between $.80 and $1.50. Research also suggests that the size of the multiplier depends on economic conditions and the types of spending that take place. Spending multipliers tend to be higher during recessions, when there are underemployed resources in the economy.

Also, empirical research has found that when the government spending targets low-income individuals, such as SNAP recipients, the multipliers tend to be larger. Low-income recipients of government assistance spend most, if not all, of the money they receive soon after receiving it. Higher income individuals, on the other hand, are more likely to save a substantial share of their increased income from the government spending. Although savings spur economic growth through deferred consumption and investment spending, these are less likely than SNAP recipients’ spending to occur in the short term (within a year).

ERS researchers used data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to identify and measure the broad types of goods and services that SNAP and non-SNAP households purchase as their incomes increase. While SNAP benefits must be spent on food purchased at grocery stores, supercenters, and other food retailers (food at home), most SNAP participants spend their own cash in addition to SNAP benefits to purchase adequate food. Although SNAP households would spend the full amount of a SNAP benefit increase on food at home, their total food-at-home expenditures would be less than the combined amount of their previous spending plus the new benefit amount. This occurs because SNAP recipients usually redirect some of the cash that they would have spent on food at home to other goods or services.

The researchers used other studies’ estimates and their own analysis to derive a value that best represents how much an additional $1 of SNAP benefits would boost spending on food at home for an average SNAP household during 2016—the period of analysis for the data compiled in their study. This value is referred to as the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) food at home, and they estimated the MPC for food at home from SNAP benefits to be 0.30. This implies that for every dollar of new SNAP benefits, a 30-cent net increase in food-at-home spending would occur, and 70 cents of non-SNAP income would be redirected from food-at-home spending to other goods or services. (Estimates from other recent studies of the food-at-home MPC from SNAP benefits range from 0.16 to 0.65.)

The two categories with the largest increases in spending by SNAP households due to the additional benefits were food (including food-away-from-home spending) and durable goods. Because of their low incomes, SNAP households were, on average, likely to spend all of the new assistance income, rather than direct a part of it to savings.

When non-SNAP households received additional income, the researchers found that, on average, they were likely to spend 63 percent of the new income, and put the rest into savings. The two top categories toward which non-SNAP households would direct an income boost were savings and durable goods. Non-SNAP households’ MPC for food at home is estimated to be 0.02.

When these MPCs are applied to the additional income given to SNAP households through the new SNAP benefits, along with their share of the multiplier effects, the $1 billion in benefits is estimated to increase spending by $28.80 per SNAP recipient, ranging from $9.40 for food to $2.70 for housing and utilities. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, SNAP households accounted for 11 percent of the U.S. population in 2016. Multiplying the per capita spending amounts by SNAP participant population results in a total spending increase of $1.03 billion, with food accounting for $335.7 million of that amount.

SNAP-induced per capita expenditures of non-SNAP households are likely to be substantially lower because they do not receive the SNAP benefit. Their income increases come from the multiplier-induced spending that is triggered by the new spending of SNAP participants. Also, non-SNAP households, on average, save 37 percent of an income boost. However, because non-SNAP households represented nearly 90 percent of the population in 2016, overall SNAP-induced spending of non-SNAP households ($592 million) amounts to 58 percent of total new spending of SNAP households.

An additional $1 billion in SNAP benefits has the largest effect on spending for food, followed by durable goods Category SNAP recipient Non-SNAP recipient $ per capita Durable goods 6.1 0.5 Food 9.4 0.1 Health care 3.5 0.4 Housing and utilities 2.7 0.2 Nondurable goods 3.9 0.3 Other services 3.2 0.5 Total 28.8 2.0 $ million nationwide

Expanded SNAP Spending Raises GDP

ERS researchers compiled a new social accounting matrix to quantify the impact of additional SNAP benefits on GDP, employment, and Gross Domestic Income (GDI) across the farm economy and other industries affected by the increased SNAP assistance (see box, “Defining GDP and GDI”). A social accounting matrix is a fully integrated economic accounting system that summarizes all transactions and income transfers in the U.S. economy among economic agents, such as businesses, government entities, and private households. ERS’s matrix, called the Food Environment Data System, Social Accounting Matrix, uses 2016 data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis to model how the increased spending by SNAP households and, in turn, non-SNAP households would affect various sectors of the U.S. economy.

The model assumes that the average new SNAP household has the same spending and saving behaviors as the average existing SNAP household. Given SNAP households’ MPC for food at home of 0.30, then $1 billion in new SNAP benefits implies an increase of $300 million in food-at-home spending. This leaves $700 million remaining to be spent by new SNAP households on other goods and services. The ERS model estimates that this increased spending, combined with the subsequent induced spending of both non-SNAP households and SNAP households, would raise total output across the 202 industries in the ERS model, and lead to employment and income effects. The model finds $1 billion in new SNAP benefits would raise GDP by $1.54 billion, implying a GDP multiplier of 1.5.

Additional SNAP Benefits Have the Largest Effect on the Trade and Transportation Industries

Across the economy, approximately $1.54 billion in GDI and approximately 13,560 jobs would be supported by the $1 billion new SNAP expenditure. The hypothetical new $1 billion in SNAP benefits would have a relatively large effect on manufacturing industries and the trade and transportation industries. For example, over $200 million in GDI and 1,540 full-time equivalent jobs would be generated for manufacturing industries from the new SNAP benefits. Manufacturing industries include food and beverage processors, manufacturers of consumer durables, as well as packaging manufacturers.

For the trade and transportation industries, new income totaling $406 million and 4,450 jobs would be generated. These industries include grocery stores, food and other wholesalers, plus the trucking and rail freight industries, among others. As previously noted, the two largest grouped items of new spending would be food and durable goods, both of which rely on transportation and trade (wholesaling and retailing) services to market these products. Heath care and social services would see an increase of 2,020 jobs. The hypothetical new $1 billion in SNAP benefits would generate an additional $32 million in GDI going to the agriculture industries (farming, forestry, fishing, and hunting) and 480 full-time equivalent jobs.

The $32 million in GDI and 480 jobs accruing to the agriculture industries may seem low given the $377 million in additional combined food spending from SNAP and non-SNAP households, but two factors explain this result. First, the foods that consumers buy include inputs beyond the farm ingredients used in the food. For processed foods and beverages, these inputs can include extensive manufacturing steps and elaborate packaging, in addition to the transportation and retailing steps to get them to the consumer. Even unprocessed fresh fruits and vegetables must be shipped, and often packaged, before consumers purchase the produce in grocery stores.

ERS’s Food Dollar data series breaks out the value of the farm and non-farm inputs used to grow, manufacture, and market domestically produced U.S. foods and beverages. In 2016, 18.9 cents of a typical dollar spent on domestically produced foods and beverages in food stores went to U.S. farmers. For foods and beverages purchased in restaurants, schools, and other away-from-home eating places (food away from home), the U.S. farm share was lower—4.0 cents, reflecting the added inputs to prepare and serve away-from-home meals. Non-SNAP households are more likely to direct most of their new food spending from their income boosts to food away from home.

A second reason for agriculture’s relatively low gains from new SNAP benefits stems from the fact that some of the foods and beverages purchased by Americans are imported products, such as Chilean berries and New Zealand lamb. Imported foods and beverages made up almost 13 percent of food and beverage spending by Americans in 2016, according to ERS’s Food Dollar statistics. Purchases of imported foods do not boost U.S. growers’ incomes or agriculture jobs.

New SNAP benefits would likely advantage farmers more than would other fiscal stimulus policies directed towards low-income households, such as tax cuts or cash assistance payments. Previous studies estimated that a low-income household receiving $1 in cash assistance would increase its spending on food by 5 to 10 cents—in contrast to the 30-cent increase that is estimated to result from an additional $1 of SNAP benefits, which is targeted towards food at home. Mental accounting may play a role in these MPC for food-at-home disparities. According to mental accounting theory, households treat different income sources differently. With targeted assistance, such as SNAP benefits, households are likely to shift less of their own funds from food to other goods or services than they would do with cash assistance.

Spending Effects Would Be Smaller Under More Robust Economic Conditions

These findings about the multiplier impacts from additional SNAP assistance are derived from a model that is most appropriate to conditions during a slowing economy when unemployment is relatively high and interest rates on new business loans are relatively low. The model assumes that the additional spending—and the subsequent increased industry output—does not put pressure on the supply of labor and cause wages and loan interest rates to rise.

The multiplier impacts are likely to be smaller when the economy is at or near full employment because labor costs could potentially rise faster than production, which would raise consumer prices and reduce consumers’ purchases relative to what they would have been had consumer prices not changed. Because SNAP participation and the benefit amounts received largely depend on a household’s income, new and higher SNAP spending by the Federal Government is most likely to occur during economic downturns when employment and incomes fall and there are underemployed resources in the economy.

Defining GDP and GDI Annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures the value of all personal and government consumption expenditures, plus the value of all private, business, and government investment—plus the value of net export sales (exports minus imports)—over the entire calendar year. Gross Domestic Income (GDI) measures the same value as GDP, but does so in terms of the incomes accumulated from the sales reported in the measure of GDP. These incomes can be added up by the type of industries that sell their goods and services, or they can be added up by the categories of persons or institutions who can claim these incomes from industry—for example, hired labor, stockholders, business owners, and domestic and foreign governments.","(0, 'GDP')"

Transcript

HOST: Welcome to Ocean Shorts where we revisit popular Making Waves and Diving Deeper episodes. I’m your host Kate Nielsen. You may not realize it, but wherever you live in the U.S., you benefit from our ocean economy. From exports to imports, production jobs, and tourism, the ocean dollar stretches from the coast all the way to the heartland. In June 2015, I was joined by Jeff Adkins, an economist with NOAA, to talk about our ocean economy.

Let's listen in.

JEFF ADKINS: Well, when I talk about the ocean economy, I’m speaking specifically about a dataset that’s produced by NOAA in cooperation with the Labor Department and with the Bureau of Economic Analysis. It’s called Economics National Ocean Watch and it has time series data for six economic sectors that depend on the resources of the oceans and Great Lakes. And when I say depend on, it’s a couple of meanings—one is more directly dependent through use of the resource, things like offshore oil and gas and commercial fishing or it depends on it because it needs to happen in close proximity to the ocean—things like tourism and marine transportation.

HOST: Where in the U.S. is the largest ocean economy? Which state or which region?

JEFF ADKINS: Well, the largest economy as a whole is California, it’s enormous. It’s larger than several nations, they’re actually larger than most nations, I think there’s nine or 10 nations with an economy bigger than California, so not surprisingly, they’re one of the biggest. They’re one or two depending on whether you’re looking at employment or wages or GDP, but it’s huge. In terms of GDP it would be Texas with the GDP associated with offshore oil and gas, but in every other measure, California is the largest.

HOST: How are the inland areas of the U.S. connected to our ocean economy?

JEFF ADKINS: Well, to begin with the entire economy is really interconnected, I’ve used the analogy that it’s like a big spider’s web and if you touch any part of it the whole thing moves. Looking specifically at the ocean economy you see things like agriculture in the heartland and manufacturing all across the country and retail trade that are very dependent on our coastal ports. Restaurants across the country serve seafood that have been caught in the ocean environment. Vacationers from all across the country show up at the coastal beaches and surfing and on the business side of things, businesses across the country are supplying food and other supplies for the hotels and restaurants that support that coastal tourism.

HOST: Jeff, just to wrap up our chat today, I wanted to see if you had any final, closing words to leave our listeners with?

JEFF ADKINS: The message that I always come back to is that, you look at these data on the ocean economy and it paints the picture for what a complex planning environment that we work in that we have this common pool of resources, the ocean. And some industries that use it depend on healthy ecosystems, some of the industries that use the same resource have the potential to the health of those ecosystems and some years, everybody does well. It’s an example of how, with careful management, you can create the win-win’s where we can have the extractive industries that are doing well at the same time as those who depend on ecosystem health.

HOST: That's all for today's Ocean Shorts. Thanks for joining us! For more information on our ocean economy, see our show notes for links. Be sure to tune in for the next episode.","(0, 'GDP')"

206,An Update to the Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028 - Congressional Budget Office,An Update to the Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028  Congressional Budget Office,"Mon, 13 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiby5nb3YvcHVibGljYXRpb24vNTQzMTjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Congressional Budget Office,"CBO regularly updates its economic forecast to incorporate changes in the agency’s methodology and to ensure that the projections reflect recent economic developments and current law. This report presents the agency’s latest economic forecast, which includes the following key projections of real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product (GDP) and other factors:

In 2018, real GDP is projected to grow by 3.1 percent. That is about 0.6 percentage points faster than the pace of its growth in 2017 (see figure below). The pickup in growth is largely the result of increases in government spending, reductions in taxes, and faster growth in private investment. For the second half of the year, CBO expects real GDP to grow at roughly the same average pace as it grew in the first half of the year, which would represent a moderation following the 4.1 percent annualized growth of GDP reported in the second quarter. Such moderation occurs because several factors that boosted second-quarter growth— including a rebound in the growth of consumer spending from a weak first quarter and a surge in agricultural exports—are expected to either fade or reverse. In 2019, the pace of GDP growth slows to 2.4 percent in the agency’s forecast as growth in business investment and government purchases slows.

Growth of actual output is expected to outpace the growth of its maximum sustainable amount through the rest of 2018 and 2019, creating excess demand in the economy . Although that growth in actual output leads to lower unemployment rates and higher income in CBO’s forecast, it also creates demand for goods, services, and labor that exceeds the economy’s long-run capacity to supply them.

. Although that growth in actual output leads to lower unemployment rates and higher income in CBO’s forecast, it also creates demand for goods, services, and labor that exceeds the economy’s long-run capacity to supply them. Excess demand will put upward pressure on prices, wages, and interest rates over the next few years . In CBO’s forecast, the growth of actual output slows markedly after 2019 because higher interest rates, along with the slower growth of federal outlays projected under current law, restrain demand. As the excess demand dissipates, the unemployment rate rises and inflation and interest rates fall. By 2022, the excess demand in the economy disappears.

. In CBO’s forecast, the growth of actual output slows markedly after 2019 because higher interest rates, along with the slower growth of federal outlays projected under current law, restrain demand. As the excess demand dissipates, the unemployment rate rises and inflation and interest rates fall. By 2022, the excess demand in the economy disappears. From 2023 to 2028, real GDP is projected to grow by about 1.7 percent each year. That is slightly slower than potential output grows, on average. (Potential output is CBO’s estimate of the maximum sustainable output of the economy.) The difference between actual and potential output arises because of a slight, temporary slowdown in the growth of actual output from 2025 to 2026, when some of the major provisions of the 2017 tax act (Public Law 115-97, originally called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) are scheduled to expire.

Although CBO’s current economic forecast does not differ significantly from the forecast that the agency published in April 2018, it nevertheless incorporates several important changes. For example, the current forecast is based on the path for discretionary spending specified in CBO’s most recent budget projections, which were released in May. That path includes less fiscal stimulus over the next few years than did the path that the agency used when it previously projected economic growth. That revision slightly lowered the agency’s projections of output growth and interest rates in the near term. Additionally, CBO has further revised downward its forecast of interest rates over much of the projection period on the basis of information about financial markets and the projections of other forecasters. It has also revised slightly upward its near-term inflation forecast on the basis of recent data on consumer prices.

The economic projections in this report do not differ significantly from those of other forecasters. They are slightly stronger in the near term than most of the forecasts by the private-sector economists who contributed to the July 2018 Blue Chip Economic Indicators. They are somewhat stronger in the near term and weaker in the long term than the latest forecasts by Federal Reserve officials.","(0, 'GDP')"
207,Americans' views on the current economy - Pew Research Center,Americans' views on the current economy  Pew Research Center,"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZXdyZXNlYXJjaC5vcmcvc29jaWFsLXRyZW5kcy8yMDE5LzEyLzExL21vc3QtYW1lcmljYW5zLXNheS10aGUtY3VycmVudC1lY29ub215LWlzLWhlbHBpbmctdGhlLXJpY2gtaHVydGluZy10aGUtcG9vci1hbmQtbWlkZGxlLWNsYXNzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Pew Research Center,"By many measures, the U.S. economy is doing well. Unemployment is near a 50-year low, consumer spending is strong and the stock market is delivering solid returns for investors. Despite these positive indicators, public assessments of the economy are mixed, and they differ significantly by income, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.

Majorities of upper-income and middle-income Americans say current economic conditions are excellent or good. But only about four-in-ten lower-income adults share that view, while a majority say the economy is only fair or poor.

Views of the economy are strongly linked to partisanship, with Republicans and independents who lean toward the Republican Party much more likely than their Democratic and Democratic-leaning counterparts to have a positive view of the current economy. While attitudes toward the economy have long been partisan, they are particularly so today – and virtually all the increase in positive views of the economy since Donald Trump became U.S. president has been among Republicans. Still, income gaps persist within these party groups. In fact, lower-income Republicans are roughly four times as likely as those in the upper-income tier to give the economy an only fair or poor rating.

To the extent that current economic conditions are helping particular groups, the public sees the benefits flowing mainly to the most well-off. Roughly seven-in-ten adults (69%) say today’s economy is helping people who are wealthy (only 10% say the wealthy are being hurt). At the same time, majorities of Americans say poor people, those without a college degree, older adults, younger adults and the middle class are being hurt rather than helped by current economic conditions.

When asked how economic conditions are affecting them and their families, nearly half of adults (46%) say they are being hurt, 31% say they’re being helped and 22% say they don’t see much of an impact. Overall, Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say economic conditions are hurting their own families, but views differ significantly by income within parties.

A variety of factors go into Americans’ assessments of current economic conditions, the most prominent being perceptions about wages and income, the availability of jobs and the cost of health care. Two of these three factors are also seen as having a significant impact on people’s own financial situations: 51% say wages have a great deal of impact on their household finances, and 43% say the same about health care costs. The overall job situation is seen as less personally relevant. Instead, 45% say consumer prices have a large impact on their own financial health.

A look inside the financial lives of Americans reveals an enormous gulf in the day-to-day challenges and worries that lower-income and upper-income adults experience. Two-thirds of lower-income adults (65%) say they worry almost daily about paying their bills, compared with about one-third of middle-income Americans (35%) and a small share of upper-income Americans (14%). The cost of health care is also a worry that weighs on the minds of many Americans, particularly those in the lower-income tier. More than half of lower-income adults (55%) say they frequently worry about the cost of health care for themselves and their families; fewer middle-income (37%) and upper-income Americans (18%) share this worry.

The nationally representative survey of 6,878 adults was conducted online from Sept. 16-29, 2019, using Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel.

Defining income tiers To create upper-, middle- and lower-income tiers, respondents’ 2018 family incomes were adjusted for differences in purchasing power by geographic region and for household size. “Middle-income” adults are in families with annual incomes that are two-thirds to double the median family income in our sample (after incomes have been adjusted for the local cost of living and for household size). The middle-income range for this analysis is about $40,100 to $120,400 annually for a three-person household. Lower-income families have incomes less than roughly $40,100, and upper-income families have incomes greater than roughly $120,400. Based on these adjustments, 31% are lower income, 46% are middle income and 17% fall into the upper-income tier. See the methodology for more information about how the income tiers were determined.

Views of the economy differ depending on income and political leanings

A majority of Americans (56%) say they think current economic conditions in the country are excellent or good, including relatively few (10%) characterizing conditions as excellent and 46% saying they are good. Roughly four-in-ten Americans (44%) say current economic conditions are only fair (35%) or poor (8%).

While most Republicans and independents who lean to the Republican Party (75%) say economic conditions in the country today are excellent or good, only 41% of Democrats and Democratic leaners share that view.

But within parties, views differ substantially by income. While roughly nine-in-ten upper-income Republicans (89%) feel positively about current economic conditions, lower-income Republicans are far less likely to share that opinion. Some 57% of lower-income Republicans say current economic conditions are excellent or good, roughly similar to the share of upper-income Democrats who say this (55%). Only about one-third of lower-income Democrats (34%) rate current economic conditions positively.

Looking to the future, about half of Americans (48%) say they expect economic conditions will be about the same in a year, roughly one-third (32%) say the economy will be worse and just 20% say they think the economy will be better. The share saying economic conditions will get better is largely consistent across income groups, but upper-income adults are somewhat more likely to say they expect things will get worse.

Current views of the economy are strongly linked to predictions for the future: Those who say economic conditions are excellent or good are about three times as likely as those who have a more negative view to say things will be even better a year from now (29% vs. 9%).

Wages, job availability and health care costs matter most in Americans’ assessment of the overall economy

Americans rely on a variety of indicators to shape their views of the economy. Overall, jobs and wages are among the most important factors in their assessments of current economic conditions. About half of adults (48%) say wages and incomes contribute a great deal to their opinion about how the economy is doing; 45% say the availability of jobs has an equally important impact on their views. The cost of health care is also an important indicator for many Americans – 43% say this contributes a great deal to their assessments of the economy. About a third or more of adults say prices for consumer goods and food (37%), the country’s tax system (36%) and the federal budget deficit (32%) contribute a great deal to their views of the economy. Somewhat less important are real estate prices (27%), stock market performance (25%) and gas prices in their area (23%).

When it comes to the factors that influence their own household financial situation, Americans point to some – but not all – of the same indicators. Wages and incomes remain at the top, but less emphasis is placed on the overall availability of jobs. About half of the public (51%) says wages and incomes affect their household financial situation a great deal, 43% say the same about the cost of health care and 45% say prices for food and consumer goods impact them personally.

But other economic measures, such as the availability of jobs or the budget deficit, have a greater impact on the public’s perception of the economy than on their own household finances. While 45% say the availability of jobs contributes a great deal to their opinion about the economy, fewer (28%) say it has a great deal of impact on their own financial situation. Similarly, Americans are twice as likely to say the federal budget deficit impacts their views of the economy as they are to say it has a major impact on their household finances (32% vs. 16%).

The degree to which these various factors influence household finances differs significantly by income tier. Consumer prices and gas prices have a bigger impact on lower-income households than on middle- and higher-income households. Fully 57% of lower-income Americans say the price of food and consumer goods affects their household financial situation a great deal, compared with 46% of middle-income Americans and just 22% of those in upper-income households. Similarly, 42% of lower-income adults say the cost of gas has a significant impact on their financial situation, compared with 26% of middle-income adults and 14% of those in higher-income households.

The cost of health care affects lower- and middle-income households to a greater degree than is the case with higher-income households: About half or fewer of lower- (49%) and middle-income (46%) adults say health care costs affect their financial situation a great deal, compared with 28% of higher-income adults. On the other hand, upper-income adults are more likely to say the stock market impacts their household finances than are middle- and lower-income Americans (25% vs. 14% and 13%, respectively).

Majorities of adults say the current economy is hurting the middle class and the poor

Regardless of their views about the economy, a sizable majority of the public says the country’s current economic conditions are only helping certain groups of Americans. About seven-in-ten adults (69%) say that current economic conditions are helping people who are wealthy a lot (53%) or a little (16%). Just 10% of Americans say the current economy is hurting the wealthy and 19% say it is neither helping nor hurting.

In addition, the public sees more of an upside than a downside to current economic conditions for people with college degrees and people who are white. About half say these groups are being helped, while fewer say they are being hurt or neither helped nor hurt.

Higher-income Americans are the most likely to say that the current economy is helping wealthy people. About eight-in-ten upper-income Americans (81%) say this compared with 70% of middle-income and 62% of lower-income Americans.

Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say the current economy is helping the wealthy (77% vs 63%). Party differences persist among those in the upper-income tier (92% of Democrats vs. 70% of Republicans) and the middle-income tier (83% vs. 59%). However, among lower-income Americans, similar shares of Republicans (62%) and Democrats (63%) say the current economy is helping the wealthy.

Majorities of Americans say the economy is not working to the benefit of several other key demographic groups. Roughly two-thirds of Americans (64%) say that people who are poor are being hurt by current economic conditions (27% say they are being helped by the current economy). Similarly, 62% of adults say that people without college degrees are hurt by current economic conditions (23% say they’re being helped). Similar shares of Americans say that the current economy is hurting older adults (62%) and younger adults (61%). Meanwhile, roughly one-quarter of Americans say the economy is helping older (26%) and younger adults (28%).

About six-in-ten Americans (58%) say the economy is hurting those in the middle class, while 32% say the middle class is being helped by the current economy. Americans across income levels are about equally likely to say the current economy is hurting the middle class.

There are differences across parties, however, with Democrats much more likely than Republicans to say current economic conditions are hurting the middle class (72% vs. 41%) and the poor (83% vs. 41%). There are also differences within parties. Republicans are particularly divided by income when it comes to views of which groups the economy is hurting. For example, about half of lower-income Republicans (49%) say the economy is hurting the middle class, compared with smaller shares of middle-income (39%) and upper-income Republicans (33%). Majorities of Democrats across all income groups say the economy is not working for the middle class (77% of higher-income vs. 79% of middle-income vs. 61% of lower-income).

Lower-income Americans are about twice as likely as upper-income Americans to say the economy is hurting them and their family

Only about three-in-ten adults (31%) say the economy is helping them and their family. Nearly half (46%) say current economic conditions are hurting them and their families, and 22% say they are neither helping nor hurting.

Lower-income Americans are especially likely to see current economic conditions as harmful: 60% say conditions are hurting them and their families, compared with 43% of middle-income and 29% of higher-income adults. About half of those in the higher-income tier say economic conditions are helping their families (47%), compared with only 22% of lower-income Americans.

There is also a partisan gap in the extent to which Americans see the economy working for themselves and their families. About four-in-ten Republicans (42%) say the economy is helping them, compared with roughly a quarter of Democrats (23%). Instead, a majority of Democrats (57%) say the economy is hurting them and their families (32% of Republicans say the same).

Differences by income tier persist within each party. Lower-income Republicans are far more likely than higher-income Republicans to say current economic conditions are hurting them (47% vs. 18%). Fully 57% of higher-income Republicans say the current economy is helping them, compared with 41% of middle-income Republicans and just 30% of lower-income Republicans.

There are also differences among Democrats. Roughly two-thirds of lower-income Democrats (65%) say that current economic conditions are hurting them, as do a majority of middle-income Democrats (57%). About two-in-ten middle-income (21%) and lower-income (19%) Democrats say the current economy is helping them. In contrast, upper-income Democrats are as likely to say the current economy is helping them as they are to say it’s hurting them (38% each).

About half of middle-income adults can meet basic expenses with a little left over

The current financial situation of Americans differs drastically by income group. Overall, about three-in-ten adults (29%) say they live comfortably, 41% say they meet basic expenses with a little left over for extras, 22% say they just meet basic expenses and 7% don’t even have enough to meet basic expenses.

Among upper-income Americans, 72% say they live comfortably. By comparison, 28% of middle-income and just 8% of lower-income Americans say the same. About half of middle-income Americans (52%) say they meet basic expenses with a little left over for extras, and 17% say they are just meeting basic expenses. Lower-income Americans, however, are about as likely to say they meet basic expenses with a little left over (36%) as they are to say they just meet basic expenses (39%). One-in-six lower-income Americans (17%) say they don’t even have enough to meet basic expenses.

White adults (35%) are more likely to say they live comfortably than are black (11%) or Hispanic (20%) adults. And Americans ages 65 and older are twice as likely to say they live comfortably as those ages 18 to 29 (45% vs 22%).

Lower-income Americans are more likely to say they lived comfortably while they were growing up than to say the same about their situation today (23% then vs. 8% now). Just the opposite is true for higher-income adults: About one-quarter (26%) say they lived comfortably while growing up, far fewer than the 72% who report living comfortably now.

Though only about three-in-ten (29%) of all adults say they currently live comfortably, most of those who don’t are optimistic that they will in the future. Roughly six-in-ten adults who say they don’t currently live comfortably (63%) say they think they will have enough money to live comfortably in the future. There are significant differences by income, however. Among higher-income adults who say they don’t live comfortably now, 84% say that they think they will in the future. By comparison, 68% of middle-income and 56% of lower-income Americans who don’t live comfortably now say the same.

When asked to assess the financial situation of “most Americans,” the public paints a fairly negative picture. Only 5% of all adults say that most Americans live comfortably. About four-in-ten (38%) say most meet their basic expenses with a little left over for extras, and roughly half (47%) say most Americans just meet their basic expenses. An additional 9% say most Americans don’t even have enough to meet basic expenses.

Pluralities of all three income groups say they think most Americans are just meeting their basic expenses.

Roughly four-in-ten Americans say they frequently worry about the amount of debt they have

For many Americans, financial worries weigh heavily on their day-to-day lives. Some 45% say they worry every day or almost every day about being able to save enough for retirement. Sizable shares also worry almost every day or more frequently about paying their bills (41%), the amount of debt they have (41%) and the cost of health care for themselves and their family (39%). One-in-five employed Americans regularly worry about losing their job.

More than half of those with lower incomes say they frequently worry about paying their bills (65%), being able to save for retirement (60%), the amount of debt they have (58%) and the cost of health care for them and their families (55%). In contrast, about four-in-ten or fewer middle-class adults and smaller shares of those with higher incomes share these worries.

And while 34% of employed lower-income adults say they worry about losing their job every day or almost every day, 17% of workers with middle incomes and 10% of employed Americans with higher incomes say the same.

Few lower-income Americans have investments, about half have credit card debt

Experiences with savings and debt underscore the disparities that exist across income groups. Overall, about seven-in-ten Americans (69%) say they have some type of savings account, more than half (55%) say they have an IRA, 401(k) or a similar kind of retirement savings account, and about one-third (35%) say they have investments in stocks, bonds or mutual funds other than those held in an IRA or 401(k).

Upper-income Americans are especially likely to have each of these. About nine-in ten upper-income Americans have savings (89%) and retirement accounts (87%). Fewer (68%) have stocks or other personal investments.

Many middle-income Americans have a savings account (78%) and retirement account (65%), but fewer have stocks (38%). Just 14% of lower-income adults have stocks, and roughly one-quarter (26%) have retirement accounts. Still, a sizable share of lower-income Americans have savings accounts (48%).

Roughly half of Americans (52%) report having credit card debt, about four-in-ten have a car loan and a similar share have a mortgage. About three-in-ten (29%) have debt from medical bills and roughly one-quarter (23%) have student loan debt.

Middle-income Americans are the most likely to have credit card debt – 59% do, compared with 51% of lower-income and 41% of upper-income adults. Lower-income Americans, however, are much more likely to have medical debt (42%) than those in the middle- (28%) or upper- (10%) income tiers.

WASHINGTON, January 9, 2018— The World Bank forecasts global economic growth to edge up to 3.1 percent in 2018 after a much stronger-than-expected 2017, as the recovery in investment, manufacturing, and trade continues, and as commodity-exporting developing economies benefit from firming commodity prices.

However, this is largely seen as a short-term upswing. Over the longer term, slowing potential growth—a measure of how fast an economy can expand when labor and capital are fully employed—puts at risk gains in improving living standards and reducing poverty around the world, the World Bank warns in its January 2018 Global Economic Prospects.

Growth in advanced economies is expected to moderate slightly to 2.2 percent in 2018, as central banks gradually remove their post-crisis accommodation and as an upturn in investment levels off. Growth in emerging market and developing economies as a whole is projected to strengthen to 4.5 percent in 2018, as activity in commodity exporters continues to recover.

“The broad-based recovery in global growth is encouraging, but this is no time for complacency,” World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim said. “This is a great opportunity to invest in human and physical capital. If policy makers around the world focus on these key investments, they can increase their countries’ productivity, boost workforce participation, and move closer to the goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.”

Download the January 2018 Global Economic Prospects report.

2018 is on track to be the first year since the financial crisis that the global economy will be operating at or near full capacity. With slack in the economy expected to dissipate, policymakers will need to look beyond monetary and fiscal policy tools to stimulate short-term growth and consider initiatives more likely to boost long-term potential.

The slowdown in potential growth is the result of years of softening productivity growth, weak investment, and the aging of the global labor force. The deceleration is widespread, affecting economies that account for more than 65 percent of global GDP. Without efforts to revitalize potential growth, the decline may extend into the next decade, and could slow average global growth by a quarter percentage point and average growth in emerging market and developing economies by half a percentage point over that period.

“An analysis of the drivers of the slowdown in potential growth underscores the point that we are not helpless in the face of it,” said World Bank Senior Director for Development Economics, Shantayanan Devarajan. “Reforms that promote quality education and health, as well as improve infrastructure services could substantially bolster potential growth, especially among emerging market and developing economies. Yet, some of these reforms will be resisted by politically powerful groups, which is why making this information about their development benefits transparent and publicly available is so important.”

Risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside. An abrupt tightening of global financing conditions could derail the expansion. Escalating trade restrictions and rising geopolitical tensions could dampen confidence and activity. On the other hand, stronger-than-anticipated growth could also materialize in several large economies, further extending the global upturn.

“With unemployment rates returning to pre-crisis levels and the economic picture brighter in advanced economies and the developing world alike, policymakers will need to consider new approaches to sustain the growth momentum,” said World Bank Development Economics Prospects Director Ayhan Kose. “Specifically, productivity-enhancing reforms have become urgent as the pressures on potential growth from aging populations intensify.”

In addition to exploring developments at the global and regional levels, the January 2018 Global Economic Prospects takes a close look at the outlook for potential growth in each of the six global regions; lessons from the 2014-2016 oil price collapse; and the connection between higher levels of skill and education and lower levels of inequality in emerging market and developing economies.

Regional Summaries:

East Asia and Pacific : Growth in the region is forecast to slip to 6.2 percent in 2018 from an estimated 6.4 percent in 2017. A structural slowdown in China is seen offsetting a modest cyclical pickup in the rest of the region. Risks to the outlook have become more balanced. Stronger-than-expected growth among advanced economies could lead to faster-than-anticipated growth in the region. On the downside, rising geopolitical tension, increased global protectionism, an unexpectedly abrupt tightening of global financial conditions, and steeper-than-expected slowdown in major economies, including China, pose downside risks to the regional outlook. Growth in China is forecast to moderate to 6.4 percent in 2018 from 6.8 percent in 2017. Indonesia is forecast to accelerate to 5.3 percent in 2018 from 5.1 percent in 2017.

Europe and Central Asia : Growth in the region is anticipated to ease to 2.9 percent in 2018 from an estimated 3.7 percent in 2017. Recovery is expected to continue in the east of the region, driven by commodity exporting economies, counterbalanced by a gradual slowdown in the western part as a result of moderating economic activity in the Euro Area. Increased policy uncertainty and a renewed decline in oil prices present risks of lower-than-anticipated growth. Russia is expected to expand by 1.7 percent in 2018, unchanged from its estimated growth rate in 2017. Turkey is projected to moderate to 3.5 percent this year from 6.7 percent in the year just ended.

Latin America and the Caribbean : Growth in the region is projected to advance to 2 percent in 2018, from an estimated 0.9 percent in 2017. Growth momentum is expected to gather as private consumption and investment strengthen, particularly among commodity-exporting economies. Additional policy uncertainty, natural disasters, a rise in trade protectionism in the United States, or further deterioration of domestic fiscal conditions could throw growth off course. Brazil is expected to pick up to 2 percent in 2018, from an estimated 1 percent in 2017. Mexico is anticipated to accelerate to 2.1 percent this year, from an estimated 1.9 percent last year.

Middle East and North Africa : Growth in the region is expected to jump to 3 percent in 2018 from 1.8 percent in 2017. Reforms across the region are expected to gain momentum, fiscal constraints are expected to ease as oil prices stay firm, and improved tourism is anticipated to support growth among economies that are not dependent on oil exports. Continued geopolitical conflicts and oil price weakness could set back economic growth. Growth in Saudi Arabia is forecast to accelerate to 1.2 percent in 2018 from 0.3 percent in 2017, while growth is anticipated to pick up to 4.5 percent in the Arab Republic of Egypt in FY 2018 from 4.2 percent last year.

South Asia : Growth in the region is forecast to accelerate to 6.9 percent in 2018 from an estimated 6.5 percent in 2017. Consumption is expected to stay strong, exports are anticipated to recover, and investment is on track to revive as a result of policy reforms and infrastructure upgrades. Setbacks to reform efforts, natural disasters, or an upswing in global financial volatility could slow growth. India is expected to pick up to a 7.3 percent rate in fiscal year 2018/19, which begins April 1, from 6.7 percent in FY 2017/18. Pakistan is anticipated to accelerate to 5.8 percent in FY 2018/19, which begins July 1, from 5.5 percent in FY 2017/18.

Sub-Saharan Africa : Growth in the region is anticipated to pick up to 3.2 percent in 2018 from 2.4 percent in 2017. Stronger growth will depend on a firming of commodity prices and implementation of reforms. A drop in commodity prices, steeper-than-anticipated global interest rate increases, and inadequate efforts to ameliorate debt dynamics could set back economic growth. South Africa is forecast to tick up to 1.1 percent growth in 2018 from 0.8 percent in 2017. Nigeria is anticipated to accelerate to a 2.5 percent expansion this year from 1 percent in the year just ended.","(0, 'GDP')"

213,The Economics of Data - International Monetary Fund,The Economics of Data  International Monetary Fund,"Mon, 23 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltZi5vcmcvZW4vQmxvZ3MvQXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAxOS8wOS8yMy90aGUtZWNvbm9taWNzLW9mLWRhdGHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,International Monetary Fund,"What do all these valuable economic activities have in common, despite taking place on different continents and in different sectors of the economy?

Had we asked the question of global firms thirty years ago, the answer would probably have been “not much.” But today, the answer is clear. They all rely on the same indispensable input: data. And lots of it.

Global cooperation is needed to ward off the risk that the digital economy becomes fragmented, with data access limited by national borders.

Many of the world’s largest firms—both in the tech sector and elsewhere—now have data at the core of their business models. The value of data intensive companies like Alibaba, Alphabet, and Facebook has shot up. Some ask whether data is the new oil?

In our new paper, we explore some of the insights that economics gives us to think about the implications of data proliferation, and what this means for modern data policies. Cooperation between regulators, both within and across countries, will be vital to tackle the challenges associated with the increased flow of data.

First, the economics

Data is information, so collecting and trading it creates and shifts information across companies and consumers—for better and for worse. On hand-held screens around the world, social networks and search companies track their users to offer them new and individualized services they are more likely to enjoy.

Access to more data is helping level the playing field—whether this means a small startup getting a loan or a consumer informing themselves before purchasing a used car. But it can also mean that someone gets rejected for health insurance coverage or a mortgage because of their personal characteristics.

Data has become a key input in modern economic production alongside land, capital, labor, and oil. It feeds artificial intelligence algorithms whose predictions power applications from driverless cars to drug testing to credit provision to ad targeting.

But data is unlike other inputs, including oil, in important ways. The same data can be used by many people simultaneously without being depleted, which means its accumulation stands a better chance of boosting productivity and long-run growth. The value of data gets unlocked when it can be accessed by many firms or researchers, who then compete to innovate and generate knowledge.

Another way data is different is that when personal data about someone is exchanged by two companies, the transaction impacts the person’s privacy and can leave them at a strategic disadvantage. If that person isn’t compensated or even made aware of the transaction, the data market can generate undue harm that leaves us worse off.

Finally, it’s expensive to prevent the theft or misuse of data by others. Will firms spend enough to protect the data they have collected? Preserving their reputation provides a strong incentive to avoid a major data breach, but individual firms are unlikely to consider the impact of their decision on the public’s trust in the broader data economy.

Towards modernized data policies

The proliferation of data in the economy presents a tremendous opportunity to boost growth through efficiency and innovation. But to do so without compromising other objectives—privacy, equity, and stability—we argue that governments must modernize current policies to tackle three growing challenges.

First, data markets are too opaque—while most of us participate in the data economy daily, we aren’t fully aware of how our data is used, transferred and processed. This leads to too much data collection and too little privacy. Government policies must clarify the rights and obligations over data for the market to function efficiently.

Second, companies who build up large datasets have an incentive to hoard them. This potentially stifles competition and reduces the social benefits that could flow from wider data access. Governments can deploy a range of policies to encourage data sharing that can promote competition and innovation, while respecting privacy.





Third, it is unclear that companies are doing enough to protect the data they hold from theft and misuse. This threatens public trust and creates risks to stability that policy measures should mitigate to ensure adequate investment in cybersecurity.

Dealing with these challenges will require cooperation, both among domestic agencies and across countries. Issues of growth, privacy, competition, and stability have traditionally been handled by separate ministries and regulators; effective data policy will require an integrated approach to manage complex trade-offs.

Global cooperation is also needed to ward off the risk that the digital economy becomes fragmented, with data access limited by national borders. If countries don’t trust how global partners handle data, they may opt to erect digital barriers that impede international data sharing, undermining innovation and efficiency.

The economics of data point to a promising future, provided we get the policies right today.","(0, 'GDP')"

In some cases (advanced economies and China), these developments magnified cyclical and structural slowdowns already under way.

Further pressures came from country-specific weakness in large emerging market economies such as Brazil, India, Mexico, and Russia. Worsening macroeconomic stress related to tighter financial conditions (Argentina), geopolitical tensions (Iran), and social unrest (Venezuela, Libya, Yemen) rounded out the difficult picture.

With the economic environment becoming more uncertain, firms turned cautious on long-range spending and global purchases of machinery and equipment decelerated. Household demand for durable goods also weakened, although there was a pick up in the second quarter of 2019. This was particularly evident with automobiles, where regulatory changes, new emission standards, and possibly the shift to ride-shares weighed on sales in several countries.

Faced with sluggish demand for durable goods, firms scaled back industrial production. Global trade—which is intensive in durable final goods and the components used to produce them—slowed to a standstill.

Central banks reacted aggressively to the weaker activity. Over the course of the year, several—including the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank (ECB), and large emerging market central banks—cut interest rates, while the ECB also restarted asset purchases.

These policies averted a deeper slowdown. Lower interest rates and supportive financial conditions reinforced still-resilient purchases of nondurable goods and services, encouraging job creation. Tight labor markets and gradually rising wages, in turn, supported consumer confidence and household spending.

As investors’ confidence in the global economic outlook lost steam, so did the upswing.

2. One reason behind this loss in momentum is the implementation of tariffs by major economies—especially the United States—and retaliatory measures taken by others, including China. The increasingly protectionist rhetoric on trade has meant higher uncertainty about trade policy, which weighs on future investment decisions.

3. Despite these actions, the US economy expanded at a fast pace in 2018, as tax cuts and spending increases stimulated demand. The US Federal Reserve has continued to raise the policy interest rate as a result. Interest rates on US long-term bonds have increased less, as investors see risks to future growth and value the safety of US Treasury securities.

4. As growth and interest rates in the United States have outpaced those in other major economies, the US dollar has appreciated against most other currencies in 2018.

5. Some vulnerable emerging market economies have come under strain as the US dollar gained value and the level of risk that global financial investors were prepared to accept dropped. Most of these countries have seen increases in their external borrowing costs, but the extent of these increases varied widely.

How will the global economy fare in 2019? Stay tuned until January 21, when the World Economic Outlook Update will present the IMF’s view on where the global economy is headed.","(0, 'GDP')"

People and companies engaged in the informal economy usually operate on a small scale. This means there are no official statistics on the informal or shadow economy, as it’s sometimes called, so economists need to estimate its size. Some common techniques include surveys or indirect indicators such as the demand for currency.

The size of the informal economy—measured as a share of GDP—has fallen gradually across all regions.

Our chart of the week, based on an updated version of earlier IMF research, shows that the size of the informal economy—measured as a share of GDP—has fallen gradually across all regions. While reforms to reduce informality, such as reducing the hurdles to registering a business, are working, the shift from informal to formal takes time.

The regions with the highest share of informality during 2010–17 are sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean—both at 34 percent of GDP. This compares with 9 percent of GDP for North America. In the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the informal sector is equivalent to nearly 15 percent of GDP.

The informal economy is generally associated with low productivity, poverty, high unemployment, and slower economic growth. It is also more prevalent in low-income countries because as countries develop, the easier it is for workers to transition to the formal sector. At the same time, it provides employment and income to people who would otherwise not find employment, or it supplements their income from employment in the formal, regulated sector.

The challenge for policymakers is to create an environment where the formal sector can thrive while creating opportunities for people working in the informal sector to maintain or improve their living standards. Some of these measures include reducing the costs of doing business, tackling corruption, and improving access to finance and services.

This year’s topic of the seventh IMF Statistical Forum—Measuring the Informal Economy—will review the definition of “informal” and explore new technologies, such as using night lights from satellite images, to capture the true size of the informal economy. This will help policymakers better address the challenges of persistent informality.","(0, 'GDP')"
217,"Greece: Economy Improves, Key Reforms Still Needed - International Monetary Fund","Greece: Economy Improves, Key Reforms Still Needed  International Monetary Fund","Tue, 12 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltZi5vcmcvZW4vTmV3cy9BcnRpY2xlcy8yMDE5LzAzLzExL25hMDMxMTE5LWdyZWVjZS1lY29ub215LWltcHJvdmVzLWtleS1yZWZvcm1zLXN0aWxsLW5lZWRlZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,International Monetary Fund,"Greece: Economy Improves, Key Reforms Still Needed

Greece has now entered a period of economic growth that puts it among the top performers in the eurozone. It must now persevere with efforts to address crisis legacies and pursue needed reforms to ensure continued success, says the IMF in its recent assessment of the country’s economy.

As the IMF concludes its latest assessment on the state of the Greek economy, IMF Country Focus sat down with Peter Dohlman, IMF mission chief for Greece, to discuss the report's findings, key recommendations, and the IMF’s relationship with Greece.

What is the current status of Greece’s relationship with the IMF?

Greece no longer has a borrowing arrangement with the IMF. Instead, our relationship with Greece is centered on two formal consultations each year covering core macroeconomic and financial sector issues. As you know, we hold annual Article IV consultations with all our members, where they undergo “economic health checks,” and in the case of Greece, this took place last July. In addition, Greece is covered by what is known as Post-Program Monitoring, where we hold a second annual discussion with countries that have large outstanding loans from the IMF. Greece currently owes about SDR7.7 billion (€9.4 billion) to the IMF, making it the third largest borrower after Argentina and Ukraine.

How has the economy performed of late, and what is your assessment of future performance?

There are a lot of positive developments to point to. We expect growth to accelerate to nearly 2½ percent this year from around 2 percent in 2018. This puts Greece in the upper tier of the eurozone growth table. Unemployment is coming down, though is still unacceptably high, especially for young people. The government is meeting its ambitious fiscal targets agreed with European member states, though not without some cost to growth. Market access has been re-established with two successful government bond issuances this year.

We also see normalization in other areas. For example, customers are now free to move their cash to any bank in Greece, and the banks themselves have almost fully repaid emergency liquidity assistance provided by the European Central Bank. Over the medium term, we expect growth to gradually moderate as the economy reaches full employment.

What are some of the vulnerabilities and risks facing Greece’s economy?

Despite its hard-earned economic stability, Greece remains a country confronted by elevated vulnerabilities and weak payment discipline. This is reflected, for example, in the very high nonperforming loan ratios in the banks and elevated levels of private- and public-sector debt and arrears.

On the domestic side, there are risks from election year pressures on policies—such as to increase wages—as well as possible fatigue after years of cost cutting and reform efforts. The necessary adjustment away from the unsustainable policies that led to the crisis has imposed a heavy cost, despite efforts to protect the most vulnerable through targeted support—such as the guaranteed minimum income scheme. We also see fiscal risks from various court cases now underway that are challenging key government policies. Recent labor market policy decisions, notably the sharp hike in the minimum wage and renewed collective bargaining arrangements, help boost incomes but also increase costs and reduce firms’ abilities to respond to changing market conditions, which in turn pose risks to employment and competitiveness.

On the external side, we see risks from a potential tightening of global financial conditions or a further slowdown in growth in the EU or emerging markets.

How can Greece address these challenges and keep the economy on track?

In our report, we focus on three policy areas.

First, we are recommending policies to enhance labor market flexibility and boost productivity and competitiveness. This means that Greece should find ways to help employers more easily adjust to changing market conditions and maintain customers through addressing the rigidities in labor markets, but also through policies to help reduce nonwage costs for firms—such as lowering the tax burden and financing costs. Relatedly, product market reforms aimed at improving product choice, quality, and competition continue to lag in Greece. A renewed reform push in this area would also help support higher employment and growth.

Second, Greece can do more to support growth and social inclusion by improving the fiscal policy mix. For example, through the planned broadening of the personal income tax next year and stronger tax compliance, Greece can lower tax rates and still boost revenues to increase investment and targeted social spending. Further efforts are needed to upgrade and modernize the system of social protection, which would also facilitate ongoing efforts to improve competitiveness. In addition, we are recommending that the government prepare a contingency plan in the event large fiscal risks materialize.

Third, we are urging the government to do more to fix banks, which remain crippled by past-due loans. This will help households and businesses to once again be able to borrow at reasonable interest rates. Together, these policies can spur more growth and strengthen the resilience of the Greek economy to future shocks.

We will pick up on these issues again during the 2019 Article IV mission, scheduled to take place this summer.","(0, 'GDP')"

October 2016 Newsletter

Julie Wenah is a Policy Advisor at the Economic Development Administration

EDA Deputy Assistant Secretary Matt Erskine and EDA Policy Advisor Julie Wenah pose for a photo with manufacturing students at Austal USA in Mobile, Alabama.

Manufacturing is the backbone of the American economy.

Our ability to innovate and create products, tools, and services that transform the way we live and operate is essential to our national competitiveness.

In 2013, President Obama tasked the Economic Development Administration (EDA) with creating a program that recognizes the resurgence of U.S manufacturing and incentivizes communities to operate within a region to leverage local assets to become globally competitive. As a result, the Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership (IMCP) program was born.

My background is in intellectual property and energy/infrastructure in Africa, so when I joined EDA nearly two years ago, I was excited to delve deep into the world of manufacturing. It has been quite a ride.

The best part of leading this initiative is getting to work alongside talented federal partners across the country and 12 other federal partner agencies to support manufacturing communities.

I speak on behalf of EDA's federal partners when I say that our favorite part of this initiative is working alongside amazing manufacturing communities who have termed us their ""Best Friends Forever."" We operate as a family - there is no 'you' and 'us' between the federal government and manufacturing communities. We work collectively to enhance and improve the economic development climate in these communities.

Another great example of collaboration is when Deputy Assistant Secretary Matt Erskine traveled to communities on the West Coast/Rocky Mountain region. He visited a bike factory in Utah, after visiting a composite recycling center in Washington the day before. Utah was looking for ways to discard scrap from bike manufacturing and Deputy Assistant Secretary Erskine was able to connect the factory and recycling center with one another.

On October 7, we celebrate the 5th Annual Manufacturing Day, or as we like to call the month of October here at EDA, ""Manufacturing Month.""

EDA leadership will continue to travel - to manufacturing communities to amplify the partnerships and collaborative efforts catalyzing change in regions across the country.

Throughout 2015 and 2016, EDA, along with 12 other federal agencies, have traveled across the country in the IMCP Manufacturing Tour. This tour has given federal leadership the opportunity to engage directly with manufacturing communities - including manufacturers, educational institutions, state and local officials, and economic development organizations - and to see firsthand the impact of investments on the ground and discuss challenges and creative solutions to remedying those challenges.

These visits have been impactful and have meant a great deal to manufacturing communities. In the Southwest Alabama region, the community shared how the visit of Assistant Secretary Jay Williams was important to the self-esteem of the community and has effectively brought together the rural and urban communities within that region.

There are many challenges in U.S. manufacturing particularly around workforce development and the lack of skilled workers. I am a proponent of continuing education formally and informally. We are all constantly learning and growing. There are a variety of great paying manufacturing careers that many people are not aware of or have been exposed to. Some often say experience is the best teacher, but I truly feel exposure is the best teacher. There is no better way to become knowledgeable about opportunities and pathways without hearing it and seeing it from manufacturers, state/local officials, educational institutions, and economic development organizations.

Here at EDA, we are taking steps to support manufacturing communities in achieving that greater goal. I am hopeful that through regional collaboration and multifaceted partnerships our nation will take its rightful place as the global leader in manufacturing.

In 2023, the Texas Music Office continued its work with Jon Hockenyos and his team of economists at TXP, Inc. to update the original study, which was completed at the end of 2022.

As the 5th TMO economic impact study is being written in December 2022, the impact of the pandemic is receding as the year comes to a close, and, with patrons willing and able to return to bars, festivals, concerts, and other performance venues where live music is found. This welcome turn of events is set against the backdrop of gathering clouds on the economic horizon, as stubbornly high inflation has yielded much tighter monetary policy, which presages recession. Nevertheless, there are clear signs that music is back, as the economic impact roughly matches that prior to COVID-19. However, there is some variation from previous analysis. Specifically, the number of overall jobs associated with music in Texas has declined, albeit with the jobs that remain paying higher wages. This has little to do with music per se, but likely instead reflects broader trends in the overall labor market.

The return on investment associated with economic development is normally a longer-term payback, as external events tend to drive the fortunes of a regional economy in the near term, which the COVID-19 pandemic clearly showed. However, the outlook for Texas remains bright, not the least due to the strong influx of both firms and people in recent months. Much of Texas’ future will depend on what has brought so many here recently; a highly capable workforce, innovation and entrepreneurship, clusters in knowledge industries, the presence of world-class research universities and other institutions of higher learning, and public policy that supports growth and development.

Moreover, music is a crucial element of “Brand Texas” that draws visitors from across the globe, a key element of recovery post-pandemic for the hospitality sector. As Texas looks to its economic development future, the creativity expressed through music is a fundamental comparative advantage – the goal remains to identify the key investments, policies, and regulatory changes that can support the monetization necessary for sustainability and growth.

Combined, music business and music education directly account for just under 90,000 permanent jobs, $4.6 billion in annual earnings, and just over $10.8 billion in annual economic activity, comparable to the results pre-pandemic.

The ripple effects associated with the direct injection related to music business and music education bring the total impact (including the direct effects) to over 192,000 permanent jobs, $9.4 billion in earnings, and $26.6 billion in annual economic activity. The State of Texas also realizes approximately $470 million in tax revenue from these impacts.

Berlin, Germany: The bright economic outlook offers a chance for policymakers to address the country’s economic challenges (photo: iStock/Andrey Danilovich).

[caption id=""attachment_22394"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1024""] [/caption]

The economic outlook for Germany is bright. Optimism among investors abounds, and unemployment is at a record low. Policymakers now have a unique opportunity to address the challenges facing the German economy. These are varied but include boosting wages, investing in infrastructure, and reducing the large trade surplus. As the largest economy of the euro area, Germany also has a stake in fostering reforms in the monetary union. Successfully rising to these challenges is critical for Germany and for the euro area as a whole.

To delve more deeply into these pressing debates, the IMF and the Deutsche Bundesbank are tomorrow (January 18) hosting a conference entitled “ Germany—Current Economic Policy Debates .” By meeting in Frankfurt to discuss these issues, policymakers and other participants have the opportunity to drill down on the key issues affecting the German economy and discuss ways of addressing them. For the IMF’s part, we see room for constructive dialogue on several fronts, discussed in our latest report on the German economy .

Challenge 1: Wage growth and inflation

In Germany, the earnings that people take home each month are still growing pretty slowly. Subdued wage growth was for a long time attributed to the labor market reforms of the early 2000s. Now, however, they seem increasingly at odds with record-low unemployment rates and strong GDP growth. In the years that followed the global financial crisis, Germans agreed to keep their wage demands in check to preserve jobs. Today’s stronger economy creates an opportunity to address subdued wage growth. Doing so would be good for people’s spending power, and also for economic growth.

Faster wage growth in Germany―where the economy is operating above capacity―would also help Germany’s European peers because it would help lift euro area inflation toward the European Central Bank’s inflation target. For these reasons, it is important to consider whether a German wage acceleration will soon be under way, or whether adjustment is going to be delayed or maybe even held back by some fundamental factors, as well as the related policy implications.

Challenge 2: Aging society, budgetary surplus

Germany’s fiscal position is healthy: the public debt ratio is falling rapidly and the government is posting budget surpluses. The key question is how to make the best use of this room for maneuver in public spending. Should resources be used to enhance growth on the long-term, by, for example, building roads, creating training programs for refugees, and providing high-quality childcare and afterschool programs? Or should the surpluses be saved for later, to pay for higher pensions and health-care costs as population aging accelerates?

Maybe the answer is a bit of both, but we at the IMF see a particularly strong case to use head room in the budget (including beyond the “black zero”, namely the balanced federal budget) to invest more in public infrastructure, such as roads, railways, and digital infrastructure. We have also advised the government to spend more on reforms that help women go back to work, such as opening more childcare centers and kindergartens. Our view is that higher growth in the long term will improve prosperity, helping to offset the costs of an aging society.

Challenge 3: More balanced savings and investments

Another feature of the German economic recovery is the country’s high current account surplus. At nearly 8 percent of GDP, it is also the highest in the world in dollar terms. The high surplus shows that German households and companies still prefer to save rather than invest.

For our part, the IMF has indicated that this surplus is too large—even considering the need to save for retirement in an aging society. Boosting investment in the German economy and reducing the need to save for retirement by encouraging older workers to remain in the labor force can lower the surplus. We need to ask why German households and companies save so much and invest so little, and what policies can resolve this tension.

European consequences

Germany has a bright economic outlook, and the good news is that this is now also the case for the euro area as a whole. In our latest report , we project strong growth in the 19-member group over the next couple of years. But this growth can only be assured if essential elements of the euro area’s economic architecture are put in place. For that, the support of Germany—the euro area’s largest economy—is essential. I welcome that the preliminary coalition agreement correctly recognizes the centrality of these issues.

That is why we have called on euro area members to complete the banking union with greater risk sharing. It is why we have urged them to build a central fiscal capacity to provide a cushion in bad times. And it is why we have advocated for advancement of the capital markets union, so as to add a layer of private cross-border risk sharing.

For this to be politically as well as economically possible, countries with high debt levels should rebuild their budgetary buffers. And all countries should put in place policies to increase productivity, which has largely stagnated since the end of the global financial crisis. Those are key elements of an economically stable and growing Europe.

As we have been saying in recent months about the global economy, “The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining.” For Germany and for the euro area, the dawn has broken and the sun is today shining brighter than it has for quite some time. That’s very welcome news—let’s make the most of it by repairing the roof.","(0, 'GDP')"

Following the global financial crisis, overall current account surpluses and deficits fell sharply from about 6 percent of global GDP in 2007 to about 3.5 percent in 2013. Since then, as shown in our new External Sector Report, global current account imbalances have declined only slightly to 3 percent of world GDP in 2018, while rotating toward advanced economies and away from emerging economies, including China whose current account is now broadly in line with fundamentals.

Trade actions and tensions have so far not significantly affected global current account imbalances, as trade has been diverted to other countries with lower or no tariffs. Instead, as highlighted in an earlier blog, these trade tensions and related uncertainties are weighing on global investment and growth, especially in sectors most integrated into global supply chains (where production is carried out across multiple countries).

Despite the narrowing of global current account imbalances, stock imbalances (measured as the sum of countries’ net foreign assets and liabilities) have continued to increase, as creditor countries have run surpluses and debtor countries have run deficits for the most part. At 40 percent of GDP, stock imbalances have reached a historical peak and are four times larger than in the early 1990s. Moreover, gross external debt liabilities of sovereigns and corporates have risen sharply in some economies in recent years, supported by benign global financing conditions. This entails financial stability risks not only for borrowers in deficit countries but also savers in surplus countries.

Trade actions and tensions have so far not significantly affected global current account imbalances.

Having a proper understanding of countries’ external positions—current accounts, stock positions, and currencies—is critical to highlight policymakers’ shared responsibility to tackle external imbalances before they become too risky.

Risks from external imbalances

External imbalances are not necessarily a cause for concern, as there are good reasons for countries to run deficits and surpluses at certain points in time. For example, it is natural for young, fast growing economies to run deficits and borrow from aging advanced economies with weaker growth potential. But just as over-indebted households may lose access to credit if their earnings become insufficient to repay their debts, economies that borrow too much and too quickly from abroad may become vulnerable to sudden stops in capital flows. This would, in turn, negatively affect creditor economies as they would suffer losses on their external assets. Therefore, the challenge lies in determining when they are excessive or pose a risk.

Using a combination of numerical tools and country-specific insights, we estimate that about 35–45 percent of overall current account surpluses and deficits were excessive in 2018. Excessive current account surpluses remained centered in the euro area (driven largely by Germany and the Netherlands) and in other smaller advanced Asian economies (Korea and Singapore), while excessive current account deficits remained concentrated in the United Kingdom, the United States, and some emerging market economies (Argentina and Indonesia).

After many years of excess current account surpluses, China’s external position moved to become more broadly in line with fundamentals in 2018. This decline reflected a combination of structural factors and expansionary credit and fiscal policies, but also greater exchange rate flexibility and the associated real appreciation over the last decade.

Risks from the current configuration of external imbalances are generally contained, at least in the near term as current account deficits and debtor positions are largely concentrated in advanced economies that issue reserve currencies. That said, not everyone is immune. An intensification of trade or geopolitical tensions—with negative repercussions for global growth and risk appetite—could affect economies that are highly dependent on foreign demand or external financing.

Over the medium term, in the absence of corrective policies to reduce imbalances, trade tensions could become entrenched. Moreover, a further increase in countries’ external debts in key countries could trigger costly disruptive adjustments that could spill over to the rest of the world.

That’s why both surplus and deficit countries must work together to reduce excess global imbalances in a manner supportive of global growth and stability.

How to tackle imbalances

Many countries are now near full employment and have limited room to maneuver in their public budgets. So, governments need to carefully calibrate their policies to achieve domestic and external objectives. Countries with excess current account deficits, like the United Kingdom and the United States, should adopt or continue with growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, while those with excess current account surpluses, like Germany and Korea, should use fiscal space to boost public infrastructure investment and potential growth.

Moreover, carefully tailored and sequenced structural policies should play a more prominent role in tackling external imbalances, while boosting domestic potential growth. Reforms that encourage investment and discourage excessive saving—for example through the removal of entry barriers or stronger social safety nets—would support external rebalancing in excess current account surplus countries. Reforms that improve productivity and workers’ skill base are appropriate to promote exports in countries with excess current account deficits. Even economies with external positions that we assess to be broadly in line with fundamentals, like China and Japan, need to adopt policies that address domestic imbalances and prevent a resurgence of external imbalances; this requires structural reforms that facilitate competition in sectors like services.

Exchange rate flexibility remains key to facilitating external adjustment. As highlighted in this year’s analytical chapter, varying features of international trade, including the extent of integration into global value chains and trade invoicing in a dominant currency like the US dollar, can weaken some mechanisms of external adjustment and limit the benefits of exchange rate flexibility in the short term. So, exchange rate flexibility may need to be supported with other policies that bolster the export response, including through improved access to credit and transportation infrastructure. Allowing exchange rates to play their role, however, remains key to deliver durable medium-term rebalancing.

More generally, all countries should avoid policies that distort trade, as they tend to come at the expense of global trade, investment, and growth. Instead, surplus and deficit countries should work toward reviving international trade and strengthening the rules of the multilateral trading system that have served the global economy well over the past 75 years.","(0, 'GDP')"

Raising women’s participation in the workforce can give a bigger boost to growth than previously thought (photo: Ahrens/Steinbach Projekte/fotogloria/Newscom)

[caption id=""attachment_25131"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1024""] [/caption]

Despite some progress, the gaps in labor force participation between men and women remain large. To take just one example, no advanced or middle-income economy has reduced the gender gap below 7 percentage points.

This uneven playing field between women and men comes at a significant economic cost as it hampers productivity and weighs on growth. A recent IMF staff study finds that barriers to women entering the labor force—think of tax distortions, discrimination, and social and cultural factors—are costlier than suggested by previous research and the benefits from closing gender gaps are even larger than thought before. Policymakers should therefore focus on removing such barriers urgently.

Gender diversity matters

Our analysis springs from the observation—supported by considerable microeconomic evidence—that women and men bring different skills and perspectives to the workplace, including different attitudes to risk and collaboration. Studies have also shown that the financial performance of firms improves with more gender-equal corporate boards.

Surprisingly, previous studies have not looked at the macroeconomic implications of this micro evidence.

In the standard textbook analysis, the labor force is the sum of the headcounts of male and female workers. Because replacing a man by a woman in this sum does not affect the labor force, there are no gains from gender diversity: men and women are assumed to be perfectly substitutable.

Benefits from closing gender gaps are even larger than previously thought.

But our evidence—from macroeconomic, sectoral, and firm-level data—shows that women and men complement each other in the production process, creating an additional benefit from increasing women’s employment on growth. In other words, adding more women to the labor force should bring larger economic gains than an equal increase in male workers (reflecting the fact that, in economists’ jargon, the elasticity of substitution between women and men in production is low).

Key benefits from narrowing gender gaps

The implications of this finding are significant.

A bigger boost to growth: Because women bring new skills to the workplace, the productivity and growth gains from adding women to the labor force (by reducing barriers to women’s participation in the labor force) are larger than previously thought. Indeed, our calibration exercise suggests that, for the bottom half of the countries in our sample in terms of gender inequality, closing the gender gap could increase GDP by an average of 35 percent. Four fifths of these gains come from adding workers to the labor force, but fully one fifth of the gains are due to the gender diversity effect on productivity.

Higher productivity: When interpreting past data in situations where the gender gap has been narrowing over time, the contribution to growth from improved efficiency (or total factor productivity gains) is overstated. A portion of the gain attributed to productivity is actually due to the increased participation of women over time.

Higher male incomes: Our results suggest that men’s wages will also increase as a result of greater inclusion of women in the labor force since productivity will increase. This is important because these higher wages should strengthen support for removing barriers that hold women back from decent work.

A bigger payoff to reducing gender barriers along development paths: The rise of the services sector driven by economic development brings more women into the labor force. But our work shows that barriers to women’s employment slow this process. These barriers vary across regions and countries, and are very large in some parts of the world—equivalent to tax rates on women’s employment of up to 50 percent. And the corresponding welfare losses (which take into account consumption and leisure time) are large, even when allowing for the fact that “home production” is reduced when women enter the labor force. For example, we find that welfare costs exceed 20 percent in the Middle East and North Africa region and in South Asia.

Reaping the benefits

While there is no silver bullet, there are several policies that can help narrow gender gaps. These include enacting laws to ensure that women have equal rights to own property and access credit. Reforming taxes (for example, by replacing family taxation with individual taxation and providing tax credits) can incentivize labor force participation among low-income earners. Tackling gender inequality in education and health care, including publicly financed maternity and paternity leave, expanded childcare, and elder care availability can increase women’s participation in the labor market. Improving access to transportation, electricity, and water infrastructure can also help lift women’s participation in the workforce.

The big picture

These are not all new concerns, but there is a renewed sense of urgency. For years, the IMF has been at the forefront of policy analysis highlighting the economic costs of inequality and possible remedies. We know that the unlevel playing field between women and men has substantial economic costs and can impede the economic health of nations. What we are now learning is that these costs are even larger than we thought. Now that we see the full picture, the case for greater gender equity has become even more compelling.","(1, 'employment/wages')"

Impact-fund managers have amassed record sums, continuing a trend that can be traced back at least five years. Funds have streamed money to impact investments from a variety of sources, and asset managers are making more investments outside the sectors that formerly attracted the lion’s share of capital. Researchers have engineered novel ways of tracking and reporting impact, giving investors greater confidence that their money is producing social benefits and helping entrepreneurs make more effective decisions about their strategies and business models.

Amid these encouraging developments, it is possible to define a sharper vision for a healthy, mature impact economy that involves a wider range of actors and institutions than today’s impact-investing industry. In an impact economy, the norms—practices, policies, and standards—that are attached to the pursuit of social impact would be as widely accepted, consistent, and stable as the norms that are associated with the pursuit of profit. Encouraged by the added measure of certainty and transparency surrounding their activities, investors large and small would allocate more capital to the financing of social initiatives, and entrepreneurs would devise business models whose ambition and growth potential match investor and market demand. Consumers would direct greater shares of their spending to social enterprises, thereby spurring large mainstream companies to measure and pursue impact. Overall, the impact economy would achieve breakthrough increases in scale and productivity, with capital delivering higher risk-adjusted levels of social impact than we now see in many cases.

In this article, which incorporates findings from our in-depth interviews with more than 100 investors, fund managers, social entrepreneurs, and other impact-economy stakeholders, we consider what it will take for the impact economy to reach maturity. We begin by exploring the vision for the impact economy outlined above. We then look at the roles that various impact-economy constituencies—investors, asset managers, entrepreneurs, governments, and philanthropists foremost among them—would play in a mature impact economy. Finally, we present three potential developments that would enable the impact economy to mature fully:

instituting public policies that provide incentives and disincentives and create certainty

achieving a broad commitment to mutually reinforcing operational, measurement, and reporting norms for fund managers, social entrepreneurs, and impact-economy intermediaries

creating an industry body that promotes policies and standards of excellence and moves all participants to adopt them

These changes would enable and encourage stakeholders to reset some of capitalism’s assumptions and rules so that two goals receive equal priority: powering economic growth and wealth creation while also solving global social and environmental challenges.

Envisioning a mature impact economy

Although some of the ideas and practices that are fundamental to impact investment and social entrepreneurship originated decades ago, it was in 2007 that a group of foundations and investors convened by the Rockefeller Foundation originated the term “impact investing,” which was later defined as “investments intended to create positive impact beyond financial return.” (Others have proposed varying definitions of impact investment, although we do not seek to join that debate. ) Extending the idea at the heart of that definition—the creation of social or environmental impact in addition to financial return—to all other economic activities makes it possible to define an impact economy as a system in which institutions and individuals give equal priority to social impact and financial impact when making decisions about how to allocate resources.

An impact economy is thus a very different kind of system from a traditional capitalist economy that prioritizes only financial returns. In an impact economy, consumers and shareholders will challenge entrepreneurs and executives to show that they generate their profits in a manner that contributes to the public good. This approach to doing business is already being enacted by some organizations on several levels—in making strategic choices, in managing their supply chains, in allocating funds to investments—and by some municipal authorities. But we have yet to see it embraced comprehensively by entire industries or national economies. As such, we determined the major dimensions of a full-fledged impact economy to be investment deployment, asset management, delivery of solutions, and measurement and reporting.

Investment deployment

The past few years have seen capital flow into impact investments from a wide variety of sources (Exhibit 1). Overall, impact fund managers have amassed record quantities of assets under management: more than $228 billion, according to one estimate. Yet even this amount of money is small compared with the annual capital outlay—estimated at $1.4 trillion to $2.5 trillion of additional spending—required to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set forth by the United Nations by 2030. To close the gap, asset owners and fund managers will need to adopt investment strategies that put still more emphasis on positive social outcomes, rather than strategies that merely seek to minimize or prevent negative outcomes.

Investment trends appear to be moving in that direction. Based on surveys showing that a substantial number of investors, including “mainstream” investors, are seeking impact-investment products, there may be significant latent demand for impact investments. In a mature impact economy, then, we would expect to see more asset owners prioritizing the financing of solutions to environmental and social challenges, and a major increase in commitments of capital to impact-seeking investment vehicles.

Asset management

Considering that the 17 SDGs address a wide range of issues—from human-development challenges such as poverty, health, and gender equality to environmental concerns such as climate change and water scarcity—asset managers in a mature impact economy might be expected to back enterprises with a correspondingly diverse variety of ambitions. The past few years have seen a trend in this direction, as asset managers have directed an increasing proportion of investments beyond the financial-services and microfinance sectors (Exhibit 2).

2

We would argue that a mature impact economy will also be characterized by a wide variety in the types of investment instruments that asset managers offer clients. Impact-investing assets under management are more evenly spread among different types of investment instruments than they were just three years ago, with private placements of debt and equity making up a considerably smaller share of the market (Exhibit 3).

Delivery of solutions

A glimpse into the future of the impact economy Even when social entrepreneurs can show potential investors that their companies have good prospects of achieving profitability, they sometimes have difficulty raising funds if they cannot offer a clear exit strategy. Adobe Capital, an impact-investment company focused on small Mexican companies with strong growth potential, developed a new financing structure for early-stage enterprises that have begun to generate revenue: a revenue-based mezzanine loan with flexible schedules and a repayment grace period. Because the payments are revenue-based, the peso-denominated loan allows an enterprise to avoid large loan payments during periods when revenues are low. (Some loans have a minimum monthly payment; enterprises can reduce the principal they owe by paying more than the minimum.) The loan also includes an equity-conversion option at a predefined multiple. The convertible amount decreases as the principal is repaid, which allows the founder to retain more equity. And if the enterprise surpasses expectations and chooses to prepay the loan at the fixed multiple, the investment’s internal rate of return (IRR) increases. An underperforming enterprise can still produce an IRR of 20 percent in US dollars. Adobe Capital launched its $20 million Adobe Social Mezzanine Fund I (ASMF I) in 2012 to make investments in the form of these revenue-based mezzanine loans and other quasi-debt instruments. The fund invested in seven small and medium-size impact businesses in the healthcare, education, low-income-housing, and alternative-energy sectors. One of these businesses, NatGas, converts vehicles to engines that run on gasoline and natural gas and operates compressed-natural-gas filling stations. It also offers a financing program that helps its customers, mostly taxi and bus drivers with unstable incomes, to make smaller up-front investments. ASMF I made an 18 million peso investment in 2014. The company achieved profitability that year and saw its revenues grow through 2016. In 2017, ASMF I exited NatGas, realizing a 22 percent IRR and a 1.5 multiple of the original investment.

A mature impact economy would feature a market-clearing quantity of solutions to social and environmental challenges. In other words, impact enterprises would crop up to address environmental or social challenges that might be profitably addressed, although there will remain a large set of such challenges that cannot be solved with for-profit models. Moreover, these social enterprises would be no more likely to go unfunded than enterprises that measure their returns strictly in terms of profit (see sidebar, “A glimpse into the future of the impact economy”). This is not the situation today. Impact-focused enterprises have proliferated, and many of them operate on a modest scale, solving a particular problem in a single locale or a small number of locales. In the United Kingdom, for example, which has a relatively well-developed cohort of impact investors and social enterprises, more than 80 percent of social enterprises have annual revenues of less than £1 million.

In addition, the “buy side” of the “market” for social impact remains underdeveloped. Consumers are increasingly aware of the social and environmental impact of businesses, and more consumers have stated a preference for goods and services that help make a positive impact. This preference has become prevalent enough that companies can no longer afford to ignore it. Indeed, we are seeing large companies make greater efforts to align their market strategies with their customers’ social compass, while new enterprises are emerging that have social impact built into their business models.

At the institutional level, though, there is only modest demand for what social enterprises can provide. Social enterprises are not yet widely recognized as potential bidders for public tenders or as partners for large companies, and government pay-for-performance schemes (outcome-based contracts such as social-impact bonds) have limited uptake. In a mature impact economy, where social enterprises will come to be seen as reliable producers of social goods, we might expect such pay-for-performance schemes to account for more of the impact-investing market.

Measurement and reporting

A mature impact economy would operate according to generally accepted sets of standards for measuring and reporting social and environmental impact, which would help to quantify the value of social outcomes, support accurate tracking of progress toward the SDGs, and create the transparency that stakeholders need to make effective resource-allocation decisions. Such standards would represent the impact-economy equivalent of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles to which US companies adhere, or the International Financial Reporting Standards used in many countries across the world. (It is worth noting that even for financial accounting and reporting, there are still multiple sets of standards in use.) Impact-economy standards would ideally supersede or harmonize existing frameworks, such as the Impact Reporting and Investment Standards (IRIS) and Social Return on Investment (SROI).

It is reasonable to expect that even in a mature impact economy some enterprises and investors will choose to define their impact goals in unique ways that don’t conform to generally accepted standards and track their performance against those goals. Such idiosyncratic approaches, however, will likely become much less prevalent than they are today and occur only in contexts where generally accepted standards can’t be applied easily.

Redefining the roles of impact-economy stakeholders

Transitioning to a mature impact economy will involve significant changes in the ways that its various constituencies, or stakeholders, conduct their business. Governments, for example, would pay for social outcomes that have been measured and verified, instead of paying service providers to do work that may or may not have the sought-after impact. Some stakeholders will find that a mature impact economy no longer requires them to perform the same functions that they performed when the impact economy was less developed, and so they will take on different roles (Exhibit 4).

Asset allocators, such as foundations and pension funds, would gradually progress from screening companies or sectors out of their portfolios depending on whether they fail to meet specific thresholds for social or environmental performance (a “no negatives” requirement) and toward actively targeting companies that intend to help solve social and environmental challenges (a “positive” or “positive offset” requirement).

Fund managers, responding to the needs and expectations of asset allocators, would devote less time and effort to seeding and nurturing early-stage impact models and more time to financing the expansion of organizations with large-scale impact potential. Some fund managers would also consider financing carve-outs and major transformations of organizations that can have a disproportionate impact on social or environmental opportunities. For fund managers, the ability to help impact enterprises scale up their activities to a significant degree would become an enduring source of what might be called “impact alpha”—social and environmental performance that consistently exceeds industry benchmarks.

Social entrepreneurs would undergo a radical change in composition: away from the private-sector stars whom many investors and fund managers now hope to attract into executive roles, and toward proven “public-sector champions.” These are seasoned government officials and civil servants who have firsthand experience dealing with environmental and social problems that are rooted in market failures and therefore resistant to market-based solutions. As executives and managers at social enterprises, these public-sector champions not only commit to developing their own skills as leaders, they also assemble capable teams to pursue major opportunities for both revenue and impact, tapping into an expanding pool of millennials who are interested in impact-economy careers.

Governments would make a significant change to their operating model that sees them partner actively with private-sector organizations to deliver social outcomes. Amid rising costs (government spending is more than one-third of global GDP) and strained budgets (the global public-sector deficit is nearly $4 trillion a year), governments’ longstanding approach to financing and implementing public services appears increasingly unsustainable. In a mature impact economy, governments would work with other stakeholders to produce social outcomes that governments lack the capacity to deliver and to boost the productivity of public spending on core services. This approach would require policy makers and civil servants to first adopt the mind-set that private-sector collaboration offers a means of increasing governments’ effectiveness. Governments will also need the ingenuity to finance the delivery of social outcomes in a way that aligns the interests of private investors and enterprises with the interests of citizens. That will mean reassigning their most talented and creative people to engineer governments’ collaborations with the private sector.

Just as importantly, governments would enact public policies that favor the continued development of the impact economy by providing incentives and reducing uncertainty for investors, entrepreneurs, and other stakeholders about the viability of the social sector. For example, the National Institution for Transforming India (also known as NITI Aayog), a think-tank-style branch of India’s government, has mapped the activities of various government ministries against the SDGs and tracks the social outcomes they produce.

Social-sector organizations would pursue fewer innovations in cost containment and excellence in donor management, and more innovations in scaling and excellence in outcomes. This would represent a significant shift away from the risk-averse mode in which many social-sector organizations now operate, by which they adhere to such practices as keeping employees’ salaries low to avoid criticism for excessive spending on administrative activities. Instead, social-sector organizations in an impact economy would increase their spending in research and development or use part of their long-term endowment to make impact investments. These approaches would embolden impact investors and social entrepreneurs to invest more in their own institutional capabilities and people.

Intermediaries would move beyond merely explaining how to use various impact measures and instead compile and publish impact ratings in a new role as independent rating agencies. This activity would create greater transparency across the impact economy and reinforce demand for consistent, reliable ratings among asset allocators, investors, impact organizations, and policy makers. Highly rated agencies would be rewarded for their work and interventions, such that they would receive more or lower-cost funds. Taking this activity further, intermediaries might develop and administer professional-certification programs for fund managers and other impact-economy participants, thereby acting as gatekeepers for the impact economy.

Consumers would shift out of their relatively passive roles, in which they have weak affiliations with organizations that support progress toward positive environmental and social outcomes, and adopt patterns of actively consuming goods and services from social enterprises and sustainable brands. This shift would represent the closure of the so-called attitude-behavior gap that separates consumers’ stated preferences from their spending habits. Consumers would also help drive the development of an impact economy by engaging in local communities and political systems and expressing their views directly to institutions through traditional media, social media, and other channels.

Media organizations and analysts would take a more sophisticated approach to appraising and documenting the impact economy and its stakeholders. As the impact economy matures, media organizations would have less need to publish stories about the market distortions caused by traditional capitalism and could offer more stories about the positive outcomes produced by social enterprises and sustainability-focused enterprises. Top-tier media outlets would offer serious and high-profile coverage of the impact economy, as they do for the rest of the business world—think of an “Impact 500” business ranking that commands as much attention as annual rankings of the largest companies, wealthiest individuals, and fastest-growing businesses. Similarly, analysts in the financial and other sectors would reexamine their assumptions and make a renewed effort to evaluate impact-economy organizations on their merits and make their findings understandable to mainstream audiences. For their part, impact-economy stakeholders have an essential part to play in setting acceptable cultural and behavioral norms, demystifying concepts such as impact investment, and challenging the myths that surround these norms and concepts.

Redefining the impact economy’s potential

Among the impact-economy stakeholders we have interviewed or spoken with, there seems to be general agreement on what a mature impact economy will look like. There is also a broad consensus on this point: the impact economy will not reach maturity until it develops policies, practices, and standards to govern the social dimension of impact-related economic activities.

Such norms are readily observed in mature sectors of the service economy such as accounting and finance. For example, when mainstream investors estimate their returns on potential deals and managers make choices for their businesses, they can compare the financial aspects of their options according to common accounting principles—norms that have taken the better part of a century to develop. But when investors and managers come to evaluating the impact-related aspects of their options, no such norms exist. And while impact investors are supposed to maintain professional certifications and abide by regulations in their roles as managers of other people’s money, no such norms pertain to managing the social impact of their clients’ investment holdings.

Certain other conditions, such as a limited flow of funding, also limit the growth of the impact economy, although targeted government interventions could correct these with relative ease. (For example, the UK government used funding from dormant bank accounts and four large UK banks to provide seed capital to new impact-investment managers. ) The lack of norms governing the social dimension of impact investing, then, arguably stands out as the most powerful constraint. As such norms are established, we anticipate that the transition to an impact economy will accelerate and flows of capital, talent, and knowledge will increase. Three activities can help establish the norms that stakeholders say they need to devote more of their time and resources to the impact economy.

The changing landscape of social-impact investing

Instituting public policies that provide incentives and disincentives and create certainty for stakeholders. Governments can consider instituting policies that would encourage impact investments and the expansion of social enterprises. One such policy is incentives—for example, tax deductions for social investments that are similar to tax deductions for charitable donations. The United Kingdom has had this kind of tax-relief scheme in place since 2014 and expanded it in 2017. Incentives would also help attract wider interest in impact investments and stimulate the emergence of investment products for retail investors.

Other policy options include those that level the playing field for social enterprises, such as regulations that permit nonprofit organizations to earn revenues from the provision of services. Policy makers can also consider additional ways of creating demand for enterprise-created social impact. New approaches to contracting for public services could let government entities act as “purchasers” of social outcomes that could be funded with social-impact bonds or other impact investments.

Achieving a broad commitment to mutually reinforcing operational, measurement, and reporting norms for fund managers, social entrepreneurs, and impact-economy intermediaries. As in other fields, professional requirements and standards for conduct would help increase the quality and consistency of services provided by fund managers, social entrepreneurs, and other impact-economy stakeholders, just as they do in other fields. Industry associations could help by defining the competencies that these professionals must possess and developing programs to test and accredit those who wish to do business in the field.

Widely accepted standards and norms are especially needed for measuring and reporting impact. It is not uncommon for impact-fund managers to track social impact with metrics taken from numerous sets of standards. In a survey of fund managers, only 24 percent of respondents said they use a set of standard metrics across all the investments in their portfolios. The overwhelming majority select particular sets of metrics for each investment, sector, impact, or customer-specific objective. Social enterprises, too, have multiple sets of impact indicators to choose from. These disparate approaches to measurement impose administrative burdens: asset owners must figure out how to compare the effectiveness of fund managers that report impact in different ways, and fund managers and social entrepreneurs must spend time studying different sets of indicators and deciding how to apply them. A single set of indicators, covering the many sectors, themes, and contexts in which impact can be tracked, would alleviate this burden and help promote accountability and transparency. One recent idea of this kind, proposed by the Global Steering Group for Impact Investment, is that of “impact-weighted financial accounts,” which use multipliers to estimate a company’s social impact based on ordinary financial measures.

Creating an industry body that promotes policies and standards of excellence and moves all participants to adopt them. Some impact-economy constituents, particularly among asset managers and entrepreneurs, are relatively new to the tasks of financing and creating social impact. It is also apparent that these relative newcomers spend a lot of time developing the systems and processes to operate impact-economy organizations. (Investors have picked up on this; some have shared concerns that fund managers lack the skills required to deliver social returns on investment.) Foundations and investors have done a great deal to assist fund managers and entrepreneurs by setting up organizations where they can exchange knowledge and ideas. A well-organized industry body could now streamline the adoption of policies and standards by acting as a clearinghouse for this kind of knowledge.

Given the extent of the world’s social and environmental challenges, a major increase in the scale and reach of the impact economy is urgently needed—and will be hard to achieve. Investors, entrepreneurs, governments, and other stakeholders will need to overcome their own practical constraints and prepare themselves to assume new roles. These individual efforts will be complicated by the dynamics of convincing multiple stakeholders to agree on the shifts that have to take place and compelling them to work together rather than pursue individual agendas. An essential first step will be to agree on a shared vision for the impact economy, along the general lines proposed in this paper. With such a vision in mind, impact-economy stakeholders can together start to carry out the three main tasks described above and register initial successes that will provide motivation for a continued, sustained effort. None of this will be easy, but as the impact economy matures, it will bring new rewards to stakeholders while enhancing the welfare of people worldwide.","(5, 'stock market')"

As Prepared for Delivery

Introduction

Thank you, David, for the kind introduction.

I am so sorry I cannot join you in person today. However, it is my pleasure to welcome all of you to the 7th IMF Statistical Forum.

As David noted, informality is an issue we deal with every day in a range of economies. It is usually concentrated in unregulated activities that are difficult to measure, including agriculture and retail.

I have been interested in this topic for some time. In fact, when I was at the World Bank, I wrote about how technology can be used to reduce informality.

The reality is that far too many governments face difficulties in measuring informality. Because of poor official statistics, policymakers depend on unofficial estimates. This is why IMF staff has engaged to provide more reliable estimates. For example, we recently estimated that informality comprises 38 percent of GDP in sub-Saharan Africa during 2010 - 2014 and, in some countries, accounted for up to 90 percent of jobs [1]!

We have to better understand informality, because growth depends on it. Let me take a few minutes to explore this critical issue.

How does the informal economy relate to inclusive growth?

Take the case of digitalization. It has created more opportunities for individuals to engage in informal employment to supplement their income. Think of all the people who work in the gig economy. But we may be missing gig economy employment in labor force surveys [2].

The informal economy can provide income or a social safety net. [3] But it is a complicated issue. Poverty levels among people in informal employment are, on average, twice as high as that of people in formal employment. Why? Because of low productivity, low incomes, and limited access to government benefits.

Informality results in lower tax revenues that hinders the government’s ability to spend on social programs and investment. This means the individuals that are most in need of social programs and public infrastructure may not receive them.

IMF recent analysis has shown that persistently high inequality is associated with lower, less durable economic growth and greater financial instability.

That is why understanding informality is part of how the Fund is delivering on its commitments to help countries meet the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals. Through policy advice, through lending programs, and through capacity development we are helping countries close the gaps and meet this enormous challenge. If we get a better handle on informality, it may unlock much needed progress in a range of areas. Let me explain what I mean.

Measuring the informal economy means better policies

More accurate estimates of the informal economy can help make policies more effective and better targeted. In Uganda, for example, we assessed different changes to tax policies and found that, since a large part of the economy is untaxed, changes in tax policy did not significantly affect income distribution.

The informal economy is also an important source of employment for women. The ILO estimates that in developing economies, 92 percent of women workers are informally employed. This is the opposite of what we see in advanced and emerging market economies, where it is a greater source of employment for men.

For women, the challenge is compounded by the fact that, in addition to being paid less than men in formal employment, they are also paid less than men in informal employment.

If we are missing out on measuring the size of the informal economy, are we also underestimating the contribution of women to economic growth?

We also know that informality is more concentrated in some activities—but to what extent, and how does concentration vary from one economy to another? Statistics on the activities in the informal economy, in employment, productivity, and even the regions where the activities are prevalent are critical for designing targeted policies to support them.

If we cannot measure informality, we cannot evaluate how inclusive economic growth really is. So we may not be able to determine whether policies are working as they are intended.

Let me conclude with my sense of optimism. I hope you will leave here with a better appreciation of the challenges and opportunities in measuring the informal economy and a broader recognition of the benefits of doing so. I believe this Forum will provide further momentum to improving these statistics. We at the IMF will continue our collaboration with member countries and international organizations to improve the estimates of the informal economy and in the process help countries realize their full economic potential.

Thank you.

227,Global Economy: Good News for Now but Trade Tensions a Threat - International Monetary Fund,Global Economy: Good News for Now but Trade Tensions a Threat  International Monetary Fund,"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltZi5vcmcvZW4vQmxvZ3MvQXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAxOC8wNC8xNy9nbG9iYWwtZWNvbm9teS1nb29kLW5ld3MtZm9yLW5vdy1idXQtdHJhZGUtdGVuc2lvbnMtYS10aHJlYXTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,International Monetary Fund,"The world economy continues to show broad-based momentum. Against that positive backdrop, the prospect of a similarly broad-based conflict over trade presents a jarring picture.

Three months ago, we updated our global growth forecast for this year and next substantially, to 3.9 percent in both years. That forecast is being borne out by continuing strong performance in the euro area, Japan, China, and the United States, all of which grew above expectations last year. We also project near-term improvements for several other emerging market and developing economies, including some recovery in commodity exporters. Continuing to power the world economy’s upswing are accelerations in investment and, notably, in trade.

Looking at the largest economies, our 2018 growth projections, compared with our earlier October 2017 projections, are 2.4 percent for the euro area (up by 0.5 percentage point), 1.2 percent for Japan (up by 0.5 percentage point), 6.6 percent for China (up by 0.1 percentage point), and 2.9 percent for the United States (up by 0.6 percentage point). U.S. growth will be boosted in part by a largely temporary fiscal stimulus, which explains over one third of our upgrade over last October for 2018 global growth.

Despite the good near-term news, longer-term prospects are more sobering. Advanced economies—facing aging populations, falling rates of labor force participation, and low productivity growth—will likely not regain the per capita growth rates they enjoyed before the global financial crisis. Emerging and developing economies present a diverse picture, and among those that are not commodity exporters, some can expect longer-term growth rates comparable to pre-crisis rates. Many commodity exporters will not be so lucky, however, despite some improvement in the outlook for commodity prices. Those countries will need to diversify their economies to boost future growth and resilience.

Escalating risks

Looking past the next few quarters, moreover, there are notable risks to the outlook. As our new Fiscal Monitor documents, global debt levels—both private and public—are very high, threatening repayment problems as monetary policies normalize in an environment where many economies face lower medium-term growth rates. As the new Global Financial Stability Report shows, global financial conditions remain generally loose despite the approach of higher monetary policy interest rates, enabling a further buildup of asset-market vulnerabilities. Geopolitical risks should not be discounted; and, of course, the recent escalating tensions over trade present a growing risk.

Perceptions of these risks could already be taking a toll. For example, while global purchasing managers’ indexes remain in expansionary territory, they have recently softened—in advanced and emerging market economies alike—owing in part to weakening export orders. Financial conditions remain easy, as just noted, but have tightened somewhat since the start of the year.

At the IMF, we have been saying for a while that the current cyclical upswing offers policymakers an ideal opportunity to make longer-term growth stronger, more resilient, and more inclusive. The present good times will not last for long, but sound policies can extend the upswing while reducing the risks of a disruptive unwinding. Countries need to rebuild fiscal buffers, enact structural reforms, and steer monetary policy cautiously in an environment that is already complex and challenging.

Trade tensions

Instead, the prospect of trade restrictions and counter-restrictions threatens to undermine confidence and derail global growth prematurely. While some governments are pursuing substantial economic reforms, trade disputes risk diverting others from the constructive steps they would need to take now to improve and secure growth prospects.

That major economies are flirting with a trade war at a time of widespread economic expansion may seem paradoxical­—especially when the expansion is so reliant on investment and trade. Particularly in advanced economies, however, public optimism about the benefits of economic integration has been eroded over time by long-standing trends of job and wage polarization, coupled with persistent sub-par growth in median wages. Many households have seen little or no benefit from growth.

These trends are more due to technology change than to trade, and even in countries where trade backlash is not prominent, public skepticism about policymakers’ ability to generate robust and inclusive growth has spread. Voters’ disillusionment raises the threat of political developments that could destabilize a range of economic policies in the future, reaching beyond trade policy.

Governments need to rise to the challenges of strengthening growth, spreading its benefits more widely, broadening economic opportunity through investments in people, and increasing workers’ sense of security in the face of impending technological changes that could radically transform the nature of work. Fights over trade distract from this vital agenda, rather than advancing it.

The recent intensification of trade tensions started in early March with the United States’ announcement of its intent to levy steel and aluminum tariffs for national security reasons. The announcement has fed into several bilateral negotiations aimed at reducing U.S. trade deficits with individual trading partners. These initiatives will do little, however, to change the multilateral or overall U.S. external current account deficit, which owes primarily to a level of aggregate U.S. spending that continues to exceed total income. Recent U.S. fiscal measures will actually widen the U.S. current account deficit. Compared with our October 2017 projection, which preceded the recent U.S. tax and spending changes, we now expect the United States’ current account deficit for 2019 to be roughly $150 billion higher.

Current account imbalances can play an essential economic role, but when they become excessive, they carry risks, including the risk of generating trade disputes. In the present global environment, the burden of reducing excess global imbalances should be shared through multilateral action—excess deficit and excess surplus countries alike need to adopt macroeconomic policies that align their spending levels more closely with their incomes.

Even in the absence of excess global imbalances, however, coping with inequitable trade practices, including intellectual property concerns, requires dependable and fair dispute resolution within a strong rule-based multilateral framework. There is room to strengthen the current system rather than risk bilateral fragmentation of international trade. Plurilateral arrangements, if consistent with multilateral rules, can also provide a useful springboard to more open trade. In this respect, the eleven-country Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the forty-four-country African Continental Free Trade Area hold out promise.

Each national government can do much on its own to promote stronger, more resilient, and more inclusive growth. Multilateral cooperation remains essential, however, to address a range of challenges in addition to the governance of world trade. These other challenges include climate change, infectious diseases, cyber-security, corporate taxation, and control of corruption—among others. Global interdependence will only continue to grow and unless countries face it in a spirit of collaboration, not conflict, the world economy cannot prosper.","(0, 'GDP')"

This growth exceeds that achieved in any of the years between 2012 and 2016. It occurs as many economies have reached or are nearing full employment and as earlier deflationary fears have dissipated. Thus, policymakers still have an excellent opportunity to build resilience and implement growth-enhancing reforms.

Last April, the world economy’s broad-based momentum led us to project a 3.9 percent growth rate for both this year and next. Considering developments since then, however, that number appears over-optimistic: rather than rising, growth has plateaued at 3.7 percent.

Rather than rising, growth has plateaued at 3.7 percent.

And there are clouds on the horizon. Growth has proven to be less balanced than hoped. Not only have some downside risks that the last WEO identified been realized, the likelihood of further negative shocks to our growth forecast has risen. In several key economies, moreover, growth is being supported by policies that seem unsustainable over the long term. These concerns raise the urgency for policymakers to act.

Growth in the United States, buoyed by a procyclical fiscal package, continues at a robust pace and is driving US interest rates higher. But US growth will decline once parts of its fiscal stimulus go into reverse. Notwithstanding the present demand momentum, we have downgraded our 2019 US growth forecast owing to the recently enacted tariffs on a wide range of imports from China and China’s retaliation. China’s expected 2019 growth is also marked down. Domestic Chinese policies are likely to prevent an even larger growth decline than the one we project, but at the cost of prolonging internal financial imbalances.

Overall, compared with six months ago, projected 2018–19 growth in advanced economies is 0.1 percentage point lower, including downgrades for the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Korea. The negative revisions for emerging market and developing economies are more severe, at -0.2 and -0.4 percentage point, respectively, for this year and next year.

These revisions are also geographically diverse, encompassing important economies in Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico), emerging Europe (Turkey), south Asia (India), east Asia (Indonesia and Malaysia), the Middle East (Iran), and Africa (South Africa)—although Nigeria, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Saudi Arabia are among the petroleum exporters that will benefit from higher oil prices. Broadly speaking, however, we see signs of lower investment and manufacturing, coupled with weaker trade growth.

Rising risks

With their core inflation rates largely quiescent, advanced economies continue to enjoy easy financial conditions. This is not true in emerging and developing economies, where financial conditions have tightened markedly over the past six months, as the new Global Financial Stability Report explains in detail. The chart indicates the preponderance of recent policy tightening actions across central banks represented in the Group of Twenty. For emerging market and developing economies, gradually tightening US monetary policy, coupled with trade uncertainties and—for countries such as Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, and Turkey—distinctive factors, have discouraged capital inflows, weakened currencies, depressed equity markets, and pressured interest rates and spreads. The high levels of corporate and sovereign debt built up over years of easy global financial conditions, which the latest Fiscal Monitor documents, constitute a potential fault line.

We do not see recent developments as part of a generalized investor pull-back from emerging and frontier markets, nor do we expect the current problem cases necessarily to spill over to countries with stronger fundamentals. Many emerging economies are managing relatively well—given the common tightening they face—using established monetary frameworks based on exchange rate flexibility. But there is no denying that the susceptibility to large global shocks has risen. Any sharp reversal for emerging markets would pose a significant threat to advanced economies, as emerging market and developing economies make up about 40 percent of world GDP at market exchange rates.

Other downside risks that now appear more prominent for the near term relate to further disruptions in trade policies. Two major regional trade arrangements are in flux—the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (which awaits legislative approval) and the European Union (with the latter negotiating the terms of Brexit). US tariffs on China, and more broadly on auto and auto part imports, may disrupt established supply chains, especially if met by retaliation.

Reflecting these developments, news-based indicators of policy uncertainty have spiked recently, even if advanced-country asset markets remain less concerned. The impacts of trade policy and uncertainty are becoming evident at the macroeconomic level, while anecdotal evidence accumulates on the resulting harm to companies. Trade policy reflects politics, and politics remain unsettled in several countries, posing further risks.

To gauge the severity of the threats to growth, one must ask how governments could respond if risks are realized and widespread recession ensues. The answer is not comforting. Mechanisms of multilateral global policy cooperation are under strain, notably in trade, and need strengthening. Governments have less fiscal and monetary ammunition than when the global financial crisis broke out ten years ago, and therefore need to build their fiscal buffers and enhance resilience in additional ways, including by upgrading financial regulatory regimes and enacting structural reforms that raise business and labor-market dynamism. Despite the possibility of less “political space” in some countries, making consensus on sound policies harder to reach, there will not be a better time than now for positive action.

Long-term forces

Given the uncertainties of the moment, it is too easy to lose sight of the longer-term forces and challenges that have brought us to the current economic and political crossroads and will shape the longer-term future. Perhaps the biggest secular challenge for many advanced economies centers on the slow growth of workers’ incomes, perceptions of lower social mobility, and, in some countries, inadequate policy responses to structural economic change. Emerging market and developing economies are diverse and face an array of longer-term challenges, ranging from improving investment environments to reducing labor-market duality to upgrading educational systems. The dangers of climate change loom in the background, but are rapidly intensifying.

Regardless of income level, all countries must prepare their workforces for the ways that new technologies will change the nature of work. Ensuring that growth is inclusive is more important than ever. Unless growth can be made more inclusive than it has been, centrist and multilateral approaches to politics and policy will become increasingly vulnerable—to the detriment of all.","(0, 'GDP')"

Full Text PDF

Global growth is projected to reach 3.9 percent in 2018 and 2019, in line with the forecast of the April 2018 World Economic Outlook (WEO), but the expansion is becoming less even, and risks to the outlook are mounting. The rate of expansion appears to have peaked in some major economies and growth has become less synchronized. In the United States, near-term momentum is strengthening in line with the April WEO forecast, and the US dollar has appreciated by around 5 percent in recent weeks. Growth projections have been revised down for the euro area, Japan, and the United Kingdom, reflecting negative surprises to activity in early 2018. Among emerging market and developing economies, growth prospects are also becoming more uneven, amid rising oil prices, higher yields in the United States, escalating trade tensions, and market pressures on the currencies of some economies with weaker fundamentals. Growth projections have been revised down for Argentina, Brazil, and India, while the outlook for some oil exporters has strengthened.

The balance of risks has shifted further to the downside, including in the short term. The recently announced and anticipated tariff increases by the United States and retaliatory measures by trading partners have increased the likelihood of escalating and sustained trade actions. These could derail the recovery and depress medium-term growth prospects, both through their direct impact on resource allocation and productivity and by raising uncertainty and taking a toll on investment. Financial market conditions remain accommodative for advanced economies—with compressed spreads, stretched valuations in some markets, and low volatility—but this could change rapidly. Possible triggers include rising trade tensions and conflicts, geopolitical concerns, and mounting political uncertainty. Higher inflation readings in the United States, where unemployment is below 4 percent but markets are pricing in a much shallower path of interest rate increases than the one in the projections of the Federal Open Market Committee, could also lead to a sudden reassessment of fundamentals and risks by investors. Tighter financial conditions could potentially cause disruptive portfolio adjustments, sharp exchange rate movements, and further reductions in capital inflows to emerging markets, particularly those with weaker fundamentals or higher political risks.

Avoiding protectionist measures and finding a cooperative solution that promotes continued growth in goods and services trade remain essential to preserve the global expansion. Policies and reforms should aim at sustaining activity, raising medium-term growth, and enhancing its inclusiveness. But with reduced slack and downside risks mounting, many countries need to rebuild fiscal buffers to create policy space for the next downturn and strengthen financial resilience to an environment of possibly higher market volatility.

Expansion Continues at a Less Even Pace

As the global cyclical upswing approaches its two‑year mark, the pace of expansion in some economies appears to have peaked and growth has become less synchronized across countries. Among advanced economies, growth divergences between the United States on one side, and Europe and Japan on the other, are widening. Growth is also becoming more uneven among emerging market and developing economies, reflecting the combined influences of rising oil prices, higher yields in the United States, sentiment shifts following escalating trade tensions, and domestic political and policy uncertainty. While financial conditions remain generally benign, these factors have resulted in capital inflow reductions, higher financing costs, and exchange rate pressures, more acute in countries with weaker fundamentals or higher political risks. High-frequency data present a mixed picture of near-term global activity. Retail sales volumes appear to have picked up in the second quarter, and survey data of purchasing managers for the service sector remain generally strong. Industrial production, however, appears to have softened, and survey data of purchasing managers in manufacturing indicate a weakening of new export orders.

Commodity prices and inflation. Largely reflecting supply shortfalls, global oil prices increased 16 percent between February 2018 (the reference period for the April 2018 WEO) and early June 2018 (the reference period for the July 2018 WEO Update). In June, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC oil producers agreed to raise oil production by about 1 million barrels per day from current levels, correcting the recent undershooting of the November 2016 group target. Market expectations suggest that declining capacity in Venezuela and US sanctions on Iran may pose difficulties for the group to deliver the agreed upon production increase consistently. Futures markets, however, indicate prices are likely to decline over the next 4–5 years (in part due to increased US shale production)—as of end‑June, medium-term futures prices are about $59 per barrel (20 percent below current levels). The increase in fuel prices has lifted headline inflation in advanced and emerging market economies. Core inflation has strengthened in the United States as the labor market has tightened further, and inched up in the euro area. Core inflation in emerging markets has also increased, reflecting pass-through effects from currency depreciation in some cases and second-round effects of higher fuel prices in others. Prices of agricultural commodities have increased marginally, reflecting diminishing excess supply.

Financial conditions in advanced economies. With firmer readings on inflation and strong job creation, the US Federal Reserve continued the course of gradual policy normalization. It raised the target range for the Federal Funds rate by 25 basis points in June, while signaling two additional rate hikes in 2018 and three in 2019—a steeper schedule than indicated in March. The ECB announced that it will taper its monthly asset purchases from the current €30 billion to €15 billion in October, with an anticipated end to the program on December 31. It also indicated it will maintain policy rates at their current levels at least through the summer of 2019, a somewhat more accommodative forward guidance than anticipated by markets. US Treasury 10-year yields, at around 2.85 percent as of early July, have risen modestly since February, while yields on German 10-year bunds, at around 30 basis points, have declined over the same period. Among other advanced economies, in late May Italian sovereign spreads widened by their largest amount since 2012, following difficulties around the formation of a new government. They have since declined but remain around 240 basis points as of early July on concerns about future policies. Spillovers to other advanced economies’ bond markets were mostly contained, with other euro area spreads remaining compressed. Equity prices in advanced economies are generally higher than their February-March levels. After the February spike, volatility has subsided and risk appetite has been strong. Consequently, financial conditions in advanced economies remain generally accommodative.

Financial conditions in emerging markets. Central banks in key emerging market economies —including Argentina, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Turkey—have raised policy rates, responding to inflation and exchange rate pressures (coupled with capital flow reversals in some cases). Long-term yields have also increased in recent months, and spreads have generally widened. Most emerging market equity indices have declined modestly, reflecting, in some cases, concerns about imbalances (e.g., Argentina and Turkey), and, more generally, rising downside risks to the outlook.

Exchange rates and capital flows. As of early July 2018, the US dollar has strengthened by over 5 percent in real effective terms since February (the reference period for the April 2018 WEO), while the euro, Japanese yen, and British pound sterling are broadly unchanged. In contrast, some emerging market currencies have depreciated sharply. The Argentine peso has weakened by over 20 percent and the Turkish lira by around 10 percent, due to concerns about financial and macroeconomic imbalances. The Brazilian real has depreciated by over 10 percent on a weaker-than-expected recovery and political uncertainty. Weaker-than-anticipated macroeconomic data for South Africa contributed to the 7 percent depreciation of the South African rand, unwinding part of the sharp appreciation that had occurred in late 2017 and early 2018. The currencies of the largest emerging market economies in Asia have remained broadly in line with their levels in February, with the Chinese renminbi depreciating modestly. Reflecting signs of financial stress in some more vulnerable countries and growing trade tensions, capital flows to emerging economies weakened in the second quarter (through May) after a strong start to the year, with a pickup in non-resident sales of portfolio debt securities.

Global Growth Forecast

Global growth for 2018 and 2019 is projected at 3.9 percent, as forecast in the April 2018 WEO. While headline numbers suggest a broadly unchanged global outlook relative to the April WEO, underlying revisions point to differing prospects across economies. The baseline forecast assumes gradually tightening but still favorable financial conditions, with localized pressures based on differences in fundamentals. Monetary policy normalization in advanced economies is assumed to proceed in a well-communicated, steady manner. Domestic demand growth (notably investment, which has been an important part of the global recovery) is expected to continue at a strong pace, even as overall output growth slows in some cases where it has been above trend for several quarters. In the baseline forecast, the direct contractionary effects of recently announced and anticipated trade measures[1] are expected to be small, as these measures affect only a very small share of global trade so far. The baseline forecast also assumes limited spillovers to market sentiment, even if escalating trade tensions are an important downside risk.

Advanced economy growth is expected to remain above trend at 2.4 percent in 2018—similar to 2017—before easing to 2.2 percent in 2019. The forecast for 2018 is lower by 0.1 percentage point compared to the April WEO, largely reflecting greater-than-expected growth moderations in the euro area and Japan after several quarters of above-potential growth.

In the United States, near-term momentum in the economy is expected to strengthen temporarily in line with the April WEO forecast, with growth projected at 2.9 percent in 2018 and 2.7 percent in 2019. Substantial fiscal stimulus together with already-robust private final demand will lift output further above potential and lower the unemployment rate below levels last registered 50 years ago, creating additional inflationary pressures. Imports are set to pick up with stronger domestic demand, increasing the US current account deficit and widening excess global imbalances.

Growth in the euro area economy is projected to slow gradually from 2.4 percent in 2017 to 2.2 percent in 2018 and to 1.9 percent in 2019 (a downward revision of 0.2 percentage point for 2018 and 0.1 percentage point for 2019 compared with the April WEO). Forecasts for 2018 growth have been revised down for Germany and France after activity softened more than expected in the first quarter, and in Italy, where wider sovereign spreads and tighter financial conditions in the wake of recent political uncertainty are expected to weigh on domestic demand.

The growth forecast for Japan has been marked down to 1.0 percent for 2018 (0.2 percentage point below the April WEO projection) following a contraction in the first quarter, owing to weak private consumption and investment. The economy is expected to strengthen over the remainder of the year and into 2019, aided by stronger private consumption, external demand, and investment.

Emerging market and developing economies have experienced powerful crosswinds in recent months: rising oil prices, higher yields in the United States, dollar appreciation, trade tensions, and geopolitical conflict. The outlook for regions and individual economies thus varies depending on how these global forces interact with domestic idiosyncratic factors. Financial conditions remain generally supportive of growth, though there has been differentiation across countries based on economic fundamentals and political uncertainty. With the updraft on oil exporters from higher oil prices largely offset by the combined drag on other economies from the forces described above, the group’s overall 2018 and 2019 growth forecasts remain unchanged from the April WEO at 4.9 and 5.1 percent, respectively.

Emerging and Developing Asia is expected to maintain its robust performance, growing at 6.5 percent in 2018–19. Growth in China is projected to moderate from 6.9 percent in 2017 to 6.6 percent in 2018 and 6.4 percent in 2019, as regulatory tightening of the financial sector takes hold and external demand softens. India’s growth rate is expected to rise from 6.7 percent in 2017 to 7.3 percent in 2018 and 7.5 percent in 2019, as drags from the currency exchange initiative and the introduction of the goods and services tax fade. The projection is 0.1 and 0.3 percentage point lower for 2018 and 2019, respectively, than in the April WEO, reflecting negative effects of higher oil prices on domestic demand and faster-than-anticipated monetary policy tightening due to higher expected inflation. Growth in the ASEAN-5 group of economies is expected to stabilize at around 5.3 percent as domestic demand remains healthy and exports continue to recover.

In Emerging and Developing Europe, growth is projected to moderate from 5.9 percent in 2017 to 4.3 percent in 2018 and further to 3.6 percent in 2019 (0.1 percentage point lower than in the April WEO for 2019). Financial conditions have tightened for some economies with large external deficits— notably Turkey, where growth is set to soften from 7.4 percent in 2017 to 4.2 percent this year.

Growth in Latin America is projected to increase modestly from 1.3 percent in 2017 to 1.6 percent in 2018, and further to 2.6 percent in 2019 (0.4 and 0.2 percentage point lower than projected in the April WEO). While higher commodity prices continue to provide support for commodity exporters in the region, the subdued outlook compared with April reflects more difficult prospects for key economies, owing to tighter financial conditions and needed policy adjustment (Argentina); lingering effects of strikes and political uncertainty (Brazil); and trade tensions and prolonged uncertainty surrounding the NAFTA renegotiation and the policy agenda of the new government (Mexico). The outlook for Venezuela, which is experiencing a dramatic collapse in activity and a humanitarian crisis, was revised down further, despite the pickup in oil prices, as oil production has declined sharply.

Oil exporters in the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan region have benefited from the improved outlook for oil prices, but the outlook for oil importing countries remains fragile. Several economies still face large fiscal consolidation needs and the threat of intensifying geopolitical conflict continues to weigh on growth in the region. Growth is projected to strengthen from 2.2 percent in 2017 to 3.5 percent in 2018 and further to 3.9 percent in 2019—0.2 percentage point higher than in the April WEO for 2019.

The recovery in Sub-Saharan Africa is set to continue, supported by the rise in commodity prices. For the region, growth is expected to increase from 2.8 percent in 2017 to 3.4 percent this year, rising further to 3.8 percent in 2019 (0.1 percentage point higher for 2019 than forecast in the April WEO). The upgraded forecast reflects improved prospects for Nigeria’s economy. Its growth is set to increase from 0.8 percent in 2017 to 2.1 percent in 2018 and 2.3 percent in 2019 (0.4 percentage point higher than in the April WEO for 2019) on the back of an improved outlook for oil prices. Despite the weaker‑than-expected first quarter outturn in South Africa (in part due to temporary factors), the economy is expected to recover somewhat over the remainder of 2018 and into 2019 as confidence improvements associated with the new leadership are gradually reflected in strengthening private investment.

Growth in the Commonwealth of Independent States is projected to stabilize at around 2.3 percent in

2018–19, with an upward revision of 0.1 percentage point for each year compared with the April WEO. The outlook for the Russian economy is similar to the April projection, with the positive effects of higher oil prices counterbalanced by the impact of sanctions, while the outlook for Kazakhstan has improved on stronger oil prices.

Risks Tilted to the Downside

While the baseline forecast for global growth is roughly unchanged, the balance of risks has shifted to the downside in the near term and, as in the April 2018 WEO, remains skewed to the downside in the medium term. The possibility for more buoyant growth than forecast has faded somewhat in light of the weak outturns in the first quarter in several large economies, the moderation in high-frequency economic indicators, and tighter financial conditions in some vulnerable economies. Downside risks, on the other hand, have become more salient, most notably the possibilities of escalating and sustained trade actions, and of tighter global financial conditions.

Financial tensions. Recent bouts of volatility highlight the possibility of abrupt shifts in global financial conditions due to markets’ reassessment of fundamentals and risks, including changing expectations about monetary policy or the effects of rising trade tensions, sudden increases in risk- or term premia, and increasing political uncertainty. As discussed in the April 2018 WEO and Global Financial Stability Report, signs of firmer‑than-expected inflation in the United States could lead to a shift in market expectations of US interest rate hikes, which are currently well below those in the WEO baseline forecast. A sudden deterioration of risk appetite could trigger disruptive portfolio adjustments, accelerate and broaden the reversal of capital flows from emerging markets, and lead to further US dollar appreciation, straining economies with high leverage, fixed exchange rates or balance sheet mismatches. In some euro area countries, policy inaction and political shocks at the national level could lead to sovereign spread decompression, worsening public debt dynamics and weakening bank balance sheets. In China, where the authorities are taking welcome steps to slow credit growth, uncoordinated financial and local government regulatory action could have unintended consequences that trigger disorderly repricing of financial assets, increase rollover risks, and lead to stronger-than-forecast negative effects on activity.

Trade tensions. The outlook is also clouded by ongoing trade tensions and waning support for global economic integration in some advanced economies. In the past few months, the United States has imposed tariffs on a variety of imports, prompting retaliatory measures from trading partners. At the same time, NAFTA and the economic arrangements between the United Kingdom and the rest of the European Union are under renegotiation. An escalation of trade tensions could undermine business and financial market sentiment, denting investment and trade. Beyond its immediate toll on market sentiment, the proliferation of trade measures could increase the uncertainty about the potential breadth of trade actions, thus hindering investment, while higher trade barriers would make tradable goods less affordable, disrupt global supply chains, and slow the spread of new technologies, thus lowering productivity.

Noneconomic factors. By raising the possibility of slower reform implementation or significant changes in policy objectives, political uncertainty, including in the context of upcoming elections or their immediate aftermaths in several countries, could deter private investment and weaken economic activity. In Europe, the late May sell-off in Italian bonds has once again turned the spotlight on deep structural challenges and thin buffers at the national level, posing significant risks to the outlook. Geopolitical risks and domestic strife are weighing on the outlook in several economies, especially in the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, many countries remain vulnerable to the economic and humanitarian costs of extreme weather events and other natural disasters, with potentially significant cross‑border ramifications through migration flows.

Policy Priorities

While the baseline forecast for the global economy points to continued, if less even expansion in 2018–19, the potential for disappointments has increased. Against this backdrop, there is an even greater urgency to advance policies and reforms that extend the current expansion and strengthen resilience to reduce the possibility of a disruptive unwinding. Moreover, medium-term per capita growth projections remain below past averages in many economies. Without comprehensive measures to raise potential output and ensure the benefits are shared by all, disenchantment with existing economic arrangements could well fuel further support for growth-detracting inward-looking policies. Multilateral cooperation within an open, rule-based trade system has a vital role to play in preserving the global expansion and strengthening medium-term prospects. Given the diversity of cyclical positions, structural constraints, and available policy space, policy priorities differ across countries.

In advanced economies, the macroeconomic stance should be tailored to the maturing cyclical position. Where inflation is converging to targets, a gradual, well-communicated, data‑dependent monetary normalization can ensure a smooth adjustment. With debt levels near record highs in many countries, fiscal policies should start rebuilding buffers where needed. The pace should be calibrated to avoid sharp drags on growth, with appropriate measures to enhance economic inclusion. Procyclical fiscal stimulus should be avoided and rolled back (e.g., United States), while further steps should be taken by countries with fiscal space and excess external surpluses to boost domestic growth potential and address global imbalances (e.g., Germany). To strengthen medium term prospects, countries should prioritize supply‑side measures that raise potential output and productivity, including investing in physical and digital infrastructure, boosting labor force participation where aging threatens future labor supply, and enhancing workforce skills. Repairing remaining pockets of vulnerability in the financial sector is essential in some advanced economies in the euro area, including through continued balance sheet cleanup, promoting consolidation in overbanked jurisdictions, and boosting bank profitability. More broadly, avoiding an indiscriminate rollback of postcrisis regulatory reforms would help maintain resilience in a potentially more volatile financial environment.

Many emerging market and developing economies need to enhance resilience through an appropriate mix of fiscal, monetary, exchange rate, and prudential policies to reduce vulnerability to tightening global financial conditions, sharp currency movements, and capital flow reversals. Long‑standing advice on the importance of reining in excess credit growth where needed, supporting healthy bank balance sheets, containing maturity and currency mismatches, and maintaining orderly market conditions has become even more relevant in the face of renewed market volatility. In general, allowing for exchange rate flexibility will be an important means for cushioning the impact of adverse external shocks, although the effects of exchange rate depreciations on private and public sector balance sheets and on domestic inflation expectations need to be closely monitored. With debt levels rising rapidly in both emerging and low-income economies over the past decade, fiscal policy should focus on preserving and rebuilding buffers where needed, through growth-friendly measures that protect the most vulnerable. To raise potential growth and enhance its inclusiveness, structural reforms remain essential to alleviate infrastructure bottlenecks, strengthen the business environment, upgrade human capital, and ensure access to opportunities for all segments of society.

Multilateral cooperation remains vital to address challenges that transcend countries’ borders. Global economic integration under an open, rule‑based multilateral trade system has raised living standards, helped lift productivity, and spread innovation throughout the world. To preserve and broaden these gains, countries should work together to reduce trade costs further and resolve disagreements without raising tariff and non-tariff barriers. Cooperative global efforts are essential across a range of other areas, such as completing the financial regulatory reform agenda, preventing further buildup of excess global imbalances, strengthening international taxation, and mitigating and coping with climate change.

Some of these services offer on-demand access to goods or services with the click of a mouse or swipe of a smartphone app. Others promote the commercialized sharing of products or expertise, while still others seek to connect communities of interest and solve problems using open, collaborative platforms. These services have sparked a wide-ranging cultural and political debate on issues such as how they should be regulated, their impact on the changing nature of jobs and their overall influence on users’ day-to-day lives.

A national Pew Research Center survey of 4,787 American adults – its first-ever comprehensive study of the scope and impact of the shared, collaborative and on-demand economy – finds that usage of these platforms varies widely across the population. In total, 72% of American adults have used at least one of 11 different shared and on-demand services. And some incorporate a relatively wide variety of these services into their daily lives: Around one-in-five Americans have used four or more of these services, and 7% have used six or more.

At the same time, around one-quarter of Americans (28%) say they have not used any major shared or on-demand platforms, and many are wholly unfamiliar with the tools and vocabulary of the new digital economy. For instance, 15% of Americans have used ride-hailing apps like Uber or Lyft, but twice as many have never heard of these apps before. Similarly, 11% of Americans have used home-sharing platforms like Airbnb or VRBO, but roughly half have never heard of home-sharing sites. In addition:

61% of Americans have never heard of the term “crowdfunding.”

73% are not familiar with the term “sharing economy.”

89% are not familiar with the term “gig economy.”

Each of these individual platforms has its own unique user base. Still, exposure to these shared, collaborative and on-demand services at a broad level is heavily concentrated among certain demographic cohorts. In particular:

College graduates – 39% of college graduates have used four or more of these services, compared with just 8% of those with a high school degree or less. At the same time, around one-quarter of college graduates have used none (11%) or only one (15%) of these services.

Those with relatively high household incomes – 41% of Americans with an annual household income of $100,000 or more have used four or more of these services, three times the proportion among households earning less than $30,000 annually.

Those under the age of 45 – Exposure to these shared and on-demand services begins to drop off rapidly starting at around age 45. Around one-third of those ages 18-44 have used four or more of these services, and relatively few in this age range have no exposure at all to these services. By contrast, 44% of Americans ages 50 and older (and 56% of those ages 65 and older) have not used any of these 11 platforms.

A number of these services – though by no means all of them – are offered primarily in and around urban population centers. And urban and suburban residents are around twice as likely as those living in rural areas to use four or more of these services. At the same time, around one-quarter of urban and suburban dwellers have not used any of the platforms measured in this survey.

This report offers a detailed examination of three different services that exemplify the shared, collaborative and on-demand economy: ride-hailing apps, home-sharing platforms and crowdfunding services. Key findings about each of these three services are discussed in more detail below.

Ride-hailing apps (used by 15% of American adults)

More so than many of the services examined in this survey, ride-hailing apps appeal heavily to younger adults. The median age of adult ride-hailing users in the United States is 33, and 18- to 29-year-olds are seven times as likely to use these services as are those age 65 and older (28% vs. 4%). Ride-hailing use is also heavily concentrated among urban residents (especially younger urbanites and those with relatively high levels of income and educational attainment), while being consistently low among rural residents of all kinds.

Ride-hailing users’ attitudes toward these services are strongly positive; users are in near-universal agreement that ride-hailing saves them time and stress, and that these services offer good jobs for people who prioritize flexible working hours

When presented with a number of attributes that might describe ride-hailing apps, users respond especially strongly to two in particular: 86% of ride-hailing users feel that these services save their users time and stress, while 80% feel that they offer good jobs for those who want flexible working hours. Users also broadly agree that these services could be a good transportation option for older adults with limited mobility, and that they are less expensive than traditional taxi services.

Ride-hailing users are more divided on questions such as whether or not these services simply help serve people who already have plenty of transit options available to them, and whether they are a good way to transport unaccompanied minors. But relatively few (11%) think that these services collect too much personal information about their users. And a sizable majority of users feel that these services use drivers that they feel safe riding with (70% feel that this describes these services well, while just 5% disagree).

Frequent ride-hailing users are less likely than other Americans to own a car – but also rely heavily on a range of other transit options

Some 3% of American adults use ride-hailing apps on a daily or weekly basis, and around two-thirds of these regular ride-hailing users indicate that they own a car or regularly drive a personal vehicle. Although this means that a majority of these regular ride-hailing users are car owners/drivers, they are significantly less likely to own or drive a car than either occasional ride-hailing users or Americans who do not use ride-hailing at all.

Yet although they are less dependent on personal vehicle ownership, these regular ride-hailing users rely heavily on a wide range of personal transportation options that go well beyond ride-hailing alone – such as taking public transit, walking or riding a bike, or even using traditional taxi services. To be sure, this trend carries a strong geographic component: For Americans who live far from urban centers, a personal vehicle might be the only available option to get from one place to another. But for those with the option of doing so, ride-hailing apps can serve as one element among many in a network of transportation options that can help reduce users’ reliance on personal vehicle ownership.

Ride-hailing users are closely following the debate over the best way to regulate ride-hailing apps – and are extremely reluctant to apply legacy taxi regulations to these new services

Just 15% of Americans have used ride-hailing apps themselves, but nearly half of all adults (48%) have heard at least something about the debate happening in cities across the country over how best to regulate these services. Ride-hailing users themselves are following this issue especially closely: Fully 85% of ride-hailing users have heard at least something about this debate, and 39% indicate that they have heard “a lot” about it.

When it comes to their views on how to best regulate these services, the public at large is relatively split. Among Americans who have heard of this issue, 42% feel that these services should not be required to follow the same rules and regulations as existing taxi companies when it comes to things like pricing, insurance or disability access; 35% think that they should have to follow these rules, while the remaining 23% are not sure how they feel.

But although the engaged segment of the general public is relatively divided, ride-hailing users themselves tend to favor the notion (by a two-to-one ratio) that these services should not have to follow the same rules and regulations as legacy taxi operators. Among ride-hailing users who have heard of this debate, 57% believe that these services should not be required to follow the existing regulations that are in place for incumbent providers, while just 27% believe that existing rules and regulations should in fact apply to these new market entrants.

Are they contractors or employees? Employers or platforms? Users have varying views about the relationship between ride-hailing apps and ride-hailing drivers

Ride-hailing apps are one of the leading examples of the so-called gig economy, but many users are not entirely clear about the nature of the relationship between these services and the drivers who use them. In the abstract, users tend to view these services as software platforms rather than transportation companies, and they view their drivers as independent contractors rather than employees. Some 58% of ride-hailing users view these apps as software companies that simply connect drivers with people who are looking for a ride, while 30% view them as transportation companies that have a great deal of control over their drivers and the overall customer experience. Similarly, 66% of ride-hailing users think of the drivers who work for these services as independent contractors, while 23% view them as employees of the app or service.

At the same time, ride-hailing users place varying degrees of responsibility on drivers and the services themselves when it comes to managing various aspects of the day-to-day customer experience:

68% of ride-hailing users believe that both drivers and the services themselves should be responsible for making sure that drivers are properly trained. One-quarter (23%) believe this is the sole responsibility of the services, while 8% think it is the responsibility of each individual driver.

62% of users believe that both drivers and services should be responsible for making sure that the vehicles that customers request are clean and safe. Some 12% think this is the responsibility of the services alone, while 24% think it is up to individual drivers to ensure this.

Ride-hailing apps are discussed in detail in Chapter 2 of this report.

Home-sharing platforms (used by 11% of adults)

Around one-in-ten Americans have used a home-sharing site such as Airbnb or HomeAway to stay in someone’s home for a period of time – and these services appeal to a relatively broad age spectrum in comparison with ride-hailing apps. Americans ages 35-44 are nearly twice as likely as those ages 18-24 to have used home-sharing services (16% vs. 9%), and the median age of home-sharing users in the United States is 42 – nearly a decade older than the median ride-hailing user.

Users view these services as a good option for groups traveling together and a good way for homeowners to make extra income; at the same time, many users view these services as best for adventurous travelers, and around one-in-five think of them as risky to use

When presented with several attributes that might define home-sharing services, users respond especially strongly to the notion that these services are a good option for families or people who travel as a group (87% of users feel that this describes home-sharing sites well), and that they are a good way for homeowners to earn extra money (85%). At the same time, many users of these sites view home-sharing as something that is perhaps not for everyone. Roughly half of users (53%) say these services are best-suited for adventurous travelers; 42% say the properties on these sites are not always as appealing as they seem online; and around one-in-five (18%) say they are generally risky to use.

37% of home-sharing users have used these services to stay in a shared space in someone’s home

Some 37% of home-sharing users report that they have used these services to reserve a single room or other type of shared space in someone’s home (this works out to 4% of all American adults). However, many of these users express some level of reservation about doing so. Some 48% of those who have stayed in this type of shared lodging say they worry about staying with someone they have never met before, and 66% of these users feel that home-sharing services are best for adventurous travelers. In addition, these users are twice as likely to have had a bad experience using home-sharing compared with other users.

As was true of ride-hailing, the structure of home-sharing services is difficult for many users to place into the context of the traditional hospitality industry

Much like ride-hailing apps in the context of the employer/worker relationship, home-sharing services are structured much differently from traditional hotels – and consumers are not always clear on the precise nature of this new arrangement. Some 58% of home-sharing users indicate that they see these services as software companies whose business is simply connecting people with a spare room or empty house with others who are looking for a place to stay. At the same time, 26% view them as hospitality companies that vouch for the quality of the properties they list and have a good deal of control over the customer experience.

And as was also true in the case of ride-hailing, home-sharing users place varying levels of responsibility on homeowners and the services themselves when it comes to managing specific aspects of the day-to-day user experience:

67% of home-sharing users believe that both individual homeowners and the services themselves should be responsible for making sure that properties are described accurately. Some 8% think it is the sole responsibility of the app or service that people use to book their stay, while one-quarter (23%) believe it is the sole responsibility of individual homeowners.

57% of users believe that both homeowners and services should be responsible for resolving payment issues between hosts and guests. Some 31% think this is the responsibility of the services alone, while 11% think it is the responsibility of individual homeowners.

53% of users believe that both homeowners and services should be responsible for addressing problems that might come up during someone’s stay. One-in-ten (10%) believe that this is the sole responsibility of the app or service, while 35% believe it is the responsibility of the homeowner alone.

Most home-sharing users are not following the debate over the legal and regulatory status of these services particularly closely; those who are following this issue tend to feel that these services should be legal, and that owners should not have to pay hotel or lodging taxes

Much like ride-hailing apps, the legal and regulatory status of home-sharing services has been the subject of much debate in cities around the country. But in contrast to ride-hailing, relatively few Americans have been following the debate over home-sharing services: 22% of Americans have heard something about this issue, with just 6% indicating that they have heard “a lot” about it. Even users of home-sharing services themselves are not following this issue particularly closely: Just 19% of home-sharing users have heard “a lot” about it, while 37% have heard “a little.”

But although home-sharing users have not been following the legal debate over these services with nearly the same intensity as their ride-hailing counterparts, those home-sharing users who have been following this issue tend to feel that these services should be both legal and tax-free for owners. Among home-sharing users who are aware of the legal debate over these services, 56% believe that these services should be legal, and that owners should not have to pay any local hotel or lodging taxes; just 31% believe that owners should be able to legally rent out these services but should have to pay taxes for the privilege of doing so.

Home-sharing sites are discussed in more detail in Chapter 3.

Crowdfunding sites (used by 22% of adults)

Around one-in-five American adults have contributed to an online fundraising project on a site like Kickstarter or GoFundMe, and 3% of Americans have created their own fundraising project on one of these sites.

Most crowdfunding donors have made relatively modest contributions to a handful of projects

The overwhelming majority of crowdfunding users have contributed to a handful of projects: Some 87% of donors say they have contributed to a total of five projects or fewer on these sites. And while 62% of donors have given $50 at most to an individual project, relatively large donations are not uncommon: 21% of these donors have given between $51 and $100 to an individual project, 14% have given between $101 and $500, and 3% have donated more than $500 at one time.

Contributions to help an individual in need – often a friend or family member – are the most common type of crowdfunding donation

Users frequently contribute to crowdfunding projects as a way to help individuals in need. Fully 68% of crowdfunding donors have contributed to a project to help someone facing some sort of hardship or financial challenge, making it the most common type of project of the five evaluated in this survey. In addition to these types of projects:

34% of crowdfunding donors have contributed to a project to fund a new product or invention.

32% have contributed to a project for a school.

30% to a project for a musician or other creative artist.

10% to a project for a new restaurant or other type of business.

Contributions to help someone in need are more often directed toward a person who is already known by the donor, as opposed to a stranger or a public figure. Among those who have contributed to a crowdsourced project to help someone in need, 63% say they have given to help a friend of a friend or an acquaintance, while 62% have contributed to help a close friend or member of their family. By contrast, just 7% of these donors have given to a campaign to assist a public figure, while 28% have given to help someone who was not a public figure but whom they did not know personally.

Men and women take a different approach to crowdfunding: Women are more likely to contribute to help someone in need, while men are more likely to fund new products or inventions

Men and women differ in a number of ways when it comes to their use of crowdfunding platforms. Male donors are roughly twice as likely as female donors to have contributed to six or more projects, and are also nearly twice as likely to have contributed more than $100 to an individual project. And while women are more likely to contribute to a project to help someone in need, men are more likely to help fund new products or inventions, as well as projects for musicians or other creative artists. Younger men are especially interested in funding new products and inventions: 48% of men ages 18-49 who have made a crowdfunding donation have contributed to this type of project.

Crowdfunding sites are discussed in more detail in Chapter 4.

Millions of people assemble various income streams and work independently, rather than in structured payroll jobs. This is hardly a new phenomenon, yet it has never been well measured in official statistics—and the resulting data gaps prevent a clear view of a large share of labor-market activity.

To better understand the independent workforce and what motivates the people who participate in it, the McKinsey Global Institute surveyed some 8,000 respondents across Europe and the United States. We asked about their income in the past 12 months—encompassing primary work, as well as any other income-generating activities—and about their professional satisfaction and aspirations for work in the future.

The resulting report, Independent work: Choice, necessity, and the gig economy, finds that up to 162 million people in Europe and the United States—or 20 to 30 percent of the working-age population—engage in some form of independent work. While demographically diverse, independent workers largely fit into four segments (exhibit): free agents, who actively choose independent work and derive their primary income from it; casual earners, who use independent work for supplemental income and do so by choice; reluctants, who make their primary living from independent work but would prefer traditional jobs; and the financially strapped, who do supplemental independent work out of necessity.

232,Ecuador's New Economic Plan Explained - International Monetary Fund,Ecuador's New Economic Plan Explained  International Monetary Fund,"Thu, 21 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltZi5vcmcvZW4vTmV3cy9BcnRpY2xlcy8yMDE5LzAzLzIwL05BMDMyMTE5LUVjdWFkb3ItTmV3LUVjb25vbWljLVBsYW4tRXhwbGFpbmVk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,International Monetary Fund,"Ecuador's New Economic Plan Explained

Ecuador has developed a new economic plan designed to put the country’s debt on a firm downward path, create jobs, protect the poor and most vulnerable, and bolster the fight against corruption.

The plan, supported by a US$4.2 billion Extended Fund Facility from the IMF, along with additional financial support from the international community, will give Ecuador the boost needed to restore sustainable growth that benefits all Ecuadorians.



In the following interview, Anna Ivanova, IMF’s mission chief for Ecuador, discusses the details of the economic plan.

Ecuador’s economy has been one of the most stable in Latin America. Why did the country decide to come to the IMF?

Ecuador has enjoyed a healthy economy supported by the dollarization regime—the country uses the US dollar for its currency—and high oil prices. However, oil wealth and dollarization are double-edged swords. Over the past decade, Ecuador’s policies were inconsistent with the dollarization regime. Wage increases outpaced productivity growth and hurt the country’s competitiveness.

The oil price plunge of 2014 and the subsequent US dollar appreciation exposed the underlying weaknesses of the economy. To finance growing fiscal imbalances, the previous government resorted to central bank financing. Public debt doubled over the past five years and international reserves fell to very low levels.



The current government of Ecuador decided to proactively come to the IMF for support to tackle underlying economic vulnerabilities, restore growth, and improve social outcomes.

What does the new economic plan seek to achieve?

Ecuador has committed to a new economic program that seeks to put public debt firmly on a downward path and supports policies that will help lift growth and boost productivity. The program strongly supports the government’s prosperity plan and is based on four key pillars:

fortify the institutional foundations of Ecuador’s dollarization;

boost competitiveness and create jobs;

promote shared prosperity and protect the poor and most vulnerable; and

improve transparency and strengthen the fight against corruption.

This is an ambitious reform agenda, but these reforms are necessary to strengthen the economy and institutions in Ecuador.

As Ecuador is a dollarized economy, a strong US dollar can raise the price of Ecuador’s goods, thereby hurting the country’s competitiveness in the global market. How does the plan address this challenge?

Raising Ecuador’s competitiveness and raising productivity will require a concerted effort. Since Ecuador uses the US dollar as its currency, it is not able to use exchange rates as a tool to make its exports more competitive in the global market. Therefore, the country will have to rely on policies that allow for internal devaluation instead.

First and foremost, reigning in government spending, particularly through the optimization of the wage bill, will be important to make Ecuador’s exports more attractive. Moreover, allowing for less rigidity in wages and prices could help support external adjustment. This can be achieved through policies that remove rigidities in the labor and product markets and in the financial sector.

How will the program support jobs and more workers in the formal labor market?



In addition to what I mentioned, other reforms to make the country an attractive business destination and to boost growth and more formal employment include reviewing the system of taxation and removing obstacles to business formation and operation. Other key reforms include taking steps to encourage private investment, deepening the capital markets, opening international trade, and creating better conditions for participation of women in the labor market.

How does Ecuador fare on social indicators and how will the government protect social spending under the plan?



Ecuador has made substantial gains in reducing poverty over the past two decades, since the country adopted dollarization. The percentage of the population living below the national poverty line has fallen from 64.4 percent in 2000 to 21.5 percent in 2017 and the share of the population living below US$1.90 a day fell from 28.2 percent in 2000 to 3.6 percent in 2016.

While these are notable achievements, poverty rates among the rural and indigenous populations remain high. While social assistance spending is high by regional standards and there is good coverage of those in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution, the authorities see scope to do more. Therefore, the government included measures in the plan to continue protecting the poor and most vulnerable. These include:

increasing spending on social assistance programs, such as Bono de Desarrollo Humano, Bono Joaquin Gallegos Lara as well as extending the coverage of non-contributory pensions;

developing a social registry to improve targeting of social programs; and

increasing the efficiency and quality of primary education and health spending to improve outcomes and enhance the quality of the labor force and external competitiveness of the economy.

As you mentioned, one of the key priorities of the new plan is to continue to improve transparency and bolster the fight against corruption. Why does this matter for the economy?

The government is committed to promoting transparency and fighting corruption in the country because it impacts all corners of the economy. These efforts will help improve running businesses, lower public financing costs, and support private investment and jobs. Some key measures include:","(4, 'national debt')"
233,Where is technology taking the economy? - McKinsey,Where is technology taking the economy?  McKinsey,"Thu, 05 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ja2luc2V5LmNvbS9jYXBhYmlsaXRpZXMvcXVhbnR1bWJsYWNrL291ci1pbnNpZ2h0cy93aGVyZS1pcy10ZWNobm9sb2d5LXRha2luZy10aGUtZWNvbm9tedIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,McKinsey,"A year ago in Oslo Airport I checked in to an SAS flight. One airline kiosk issued a boarding pass, another punched out a luggage tag, then a computer screen showed me how to attach it and another where I should set the luggage on a conveyor. I encountered no single human being. The incident wasn’t important but it left me feeling oddly that I was out of human care, that something in our world had shifted.

Stay current on your favorite topics Subscribe

That shift of course has been going on for a long time. It’s been driven by a succession of technologies—the Internet, the cloud, big data, robotics, machine learning, and now artificial intelligence—together powerful enough that economists agree we are in the midst of a digital economic revolution. But there is less agreement on how exactly the new technologies are changing the economy and whether the changes are deep. Robert Gordon of Northwestern University tells us the computer revolution “reached its climax in the dot-com era of the 1990s.” Future progress in technology, he says, will be slower.

So in what way exactly are the new technologies changing the economy? Is the revolution they are causing indeed slowing—or is it persistent and deep? And if so how will it change the character of the economy?

I argued a few years back that the digital technologies have created a second economy, a virtual and autonomous one, and this is certainly true. But I now believe the main feature of this autonomous economy is not merely that it deepens the physical one. It’s that it is steadily providing an external intelligence in business—one not housed internally in human workers but externally in the virtual economy’s algorithms and machines. Business and engineering and financial processes can now draw on huge “libraries” of intelligent functions and these greatly boost their activities—and bit by bit render human activities obsolete.

I will argue this is causing the economy to enter a new and different era. The economy has arrived at a point where it produces enough in principle for everyone, but where the means of access to these services and products, jobs, is steadily tightening. So this new period we are entering is not so much about production anymore—how much is produced; it is about distribution—how people get a share in what is produced. Everything from trade policies to government projects to commercial regulations will in the future be evaluated by distribution. Politics will change, free-market beliefs will change, social structures will change.

We are still at the start of this shift, but it will be deep and will unfold indefinitely in the future.

The third morphing

How did we get to where we are now? About every 20 years or so the digital revolution morphs and brings us something qualitatively different. Each morphing issues from a set of particular new technologies, and each causes characteristic changes in the economy.

The first morphing, in the 1970s and ’80s, brought us integrated circuits—tiny processors and memory on microchips that miniaturized and greatly speeded calculation. Engineers could use computer-aided design programs, managers could track inventories in real time, and geologists could discern strata and calculate the chance of oil. The economy for the first time had serious computational assistance. Modern fast personal computation had arrived.

The second morphing, in the 1990s and 2000s, brought us the connection of digital processes. Computers got linked together into local and global networks via telephonic or fiber-optic or satellite transmission. The Internet became a commercial entity, web services emerged, and the cloud provided shared computing resources. Everything suddenly was in conversation with everything else.

It’s here that the virtual economy of interconnected machines, software, and processes emerges, where physical actions now could be executed digitally. And it’s also here that the age-old importance of geographical locality fades. An architecture firm in Seattle could concern itself with the overall design of a new high-rise and have less expensive workers in Budapest take care of the detailing, in an interactive way. Retailers in the United States could monitor manufacturers in China and track suppliers in real time. Offshoring took off, production concentrated where it was cheapest—Mexico, Ireland, China—and previously thriving home local economies began to wither. Modern globalization had arrived and it was very much the result of connecting computers.

The third morphing—the one we are in now—began roughly in the 2010s, and it has brought us something that at first looks insignificant: cheap and ubiquitous sensors. We have radar and lidar sensors, gyroscopic sensors, magnetic sensors, blood-chemistry sensors, pressure, temperature, flow, and moisture sensors, by the dozens and hundreds all meshed together into wireless networks to inform us of the presence of objects or chemicals, or of a system’s current status or position, or changes in its external conditions.

These sensors brought us data—oceans of data—and all that data invited us to make sense of it. If we could collect images of humans, we could use these to recognize their faces. If we could “see” objects such as roads and pedestrians, we could use this to automatically drive cars.

As a result, in the last ten years or more, what became prominent was the development of methods, intelligent algorithms, for recognizing things and doing something with the result. And so we got computer vision, the ability for machines to recognize objects; and we got natural-language processing, the ability to talk to a computer as we would to another human being. We got digital language translation, face recognition, voice recognition, inductive inference, and digital assistants.

What came as a surprise was that these intelligent algorithms were not designed from symbolic logic, with rules and grammar and getting all the exceptions correct. Instead they were put together by using masses of data to form associations: This complicated pixel pattern means “cat,” that one means “face”—Jennifer Aniston’s face. This set of Jeopardy! quiz words points to “Julius Caesar,” that one points to “Andrew Jackson.” This silent sequence of moving lips means these particular spoken words. Intelligent algorithms are not genius deductions, they are associations made possible by clever statistical methods using masses of data.

Of course the clever statistical techniques took huge amounts of engineering and several years to get right. They were domain specific, an algorithm that could lip read could not recognize faces. And they worked in business too: this customer profile means “issue a $1.2 million mortgage”; that one means “don’t act.”

Computers, and this was the second surprise, could suddenly do what we thought only humans could do—association.

The coming of external intelligence

It would be easy to see associative intelligence as just another improvement in digital technology, and some economists do. But I believe it’s more than that. “Intelligence” in this context doesn’t mean conscious thought or deductive reasoning or “understanding.” It means the ability to make appropriate associations, or in an action domain to sense a situation and act appropriately. This fits with biological basics, where intelligence is about recognizing and sensing and using this to act appropriately. A jellyfish uses a network of chemical sensors to detect edible material drifting near it, and these trigger a network of motor neurons to cause the jellyfish to close automatically around the material for digestion.

Thus when intelligent algorithms help a fighter jet avoid a midair collision, they are sensing the situation, computing possible responses, selecting one, and taking appropriate avoidance action.

There doesn’t need to be a controller at the center of such intelligence; appropriate action can emerge as the property of the whole system. Driverless traffic when it arrives will have autonomous cars traveling on special lanes, in conversation with each other, with special road markers, and with signaling lights. These in turn will be in conversation with approaching traffic and with the needs of other parts of the traffic system. Intelligence here—appropriate collective action—emerges from the ongoing conversation of all these items. This sort of intelligence is self-organizing, conversational, ever-adjusting, and dynamic. It is also largely autonomous. These conversations and their outcomes will take place with little or no human awareness or intervention.

The interesting thing here isn’t the form intelligence takes. It’s that intelligence is no longer housed internally in the brains of human workers but has moved outward into the virtual economy, into the conversation among intelligent algorithms. It has become external. The physical economy demands or queries; the virtual economy checks and converses and computes externally and then reports back to the physical economy—which then responds appropriately. The virtual economy is not just an Internet of Things, it is a source of intelligent action—intelligence external to human workers.

This shift from internal to external intelligence is important. When the printing revolution arrived in the 15th and 16th centuries it took information housed internally in manuscripts in monasteries and made it available publicly. Information suddenly became external: it ceased to be the property of the church and now could be accessed, pondered, shared, and built upon by lay readers, singly or in unison. The result was an explosion of knowledge, of past texts, theological ideas, and astronomical theories. Scholars agree these greatly accelerated the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the coming of science. Printing, argues commentator Douglas Robertson, created our modern world.

Now we have a second shift from internal to external, that of intelligence, and because intelligence is not just information but something more powerful—the use of information—there’s no reason to think this shift will be less powerful than the first one. We don’t yet know its consequences, but there is no upper limit to intelligence and thus to the new structures it will bring in the future.

How this changes business

To come back to our current time, how is this externalization of human thinking and judgment changing business? And what new opportunities is it bringing?

Some companies can apply the new intelligence capabilities like face recognition or voice verification to automate current products, services, and value chains. And there is plenty of that.

More radical change comes when companies stitch together pieces of external intelligence and create new business models with them. Recently I visited a fintech (financial technology) company in China, which had developed a phone app for borrowing money on the fly while shopping. The app senses your voice and passes it to online algorithms for identity recognition; other algorithms fan out and query your bank accounts, credit history, and social-media profile; further intelligent algorithms weigh all these and a suitable credit offer appears on your phone. All within seconds. This isn’t quite the adoption of external intelligence; it is the combining of sense-making algorithms, data-lookup algorithms, and natural-language algorithms to fulfill a task once done by humans.

In doing this, businesses can reach into and use a “library” or toolbox of already-created virtual structures as Lego pieces to build new organizational models. One such structure is the blockchain, a digital system for executing and recording financial transactions; another is Bitcoin, a shared digital international currency for trading. These are not software or automated functions or smart machinery. Think of them as externally available building blocks constructed from the basic elements of intelligent algorithms and data.

The result, whether in retail banking, transport, healthcare, or the military, is that industries aren’t just becoming automated with machines replacing humans. They are using the new intelligent building blocks to re-architect the way they do things. In doing so, they will cease to exist in their current form.

Businesses can use the new opportunities in other ways. Some large tech companies can directly create externally intelligent systems such as autonomous air-traffic control or advanced medical diagnostics. Others can build proprietary databases and extract intelligent behavior from them. But the advantages of being large or early in the market are limited. The components of external intelligence can’t easily be owned, they tend to slide into the public domain. And data can’t easily be owned either, it can be garnered from nonproprietary sources.

So we will see both large tech companies and shared, free, autonomous resources in the future. And if past technology revolutions are indicative, we will see entirely new industries spring up we hadn’t even thought of.

Reaching the ‘Keynes point’

Of course there’s a much-discussed downside to all this. The autonomous economy is steadily digesting the physical economy and the jobs it provides. It’s now a commonplace that we no longer have travel agents or typists or paralegals in anything like the numbers before; even high-end skilled jobs such as radiologists are being replaced by algorithms that can often do the job better.

Economists don’t disagree about jobs vanishing, they argue over whether these will be replaced by new jobs. Economic history tells us they will. The automobile may have wiped out blacksmiths, but it created new jobs in car manufacturing and highway construction. Freed labor resources, history tells us, always find a replacement outlet and the digital economy will not be different.

I am not convinced.

Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology point out that when automotive transport arrived, a whole group of workers—horses—were displaced, never to be employed again. They lost their jobs and vanished from the economy.

I would add another historical precedent. Offshoring in the last few decades has eaten up physical jobs and whole industries, jobs that were not replaced. The current transfer of jobs from the physical to the virtual economy is a different sort of offshoring, not to a foreign country but to a virtual one. If we follow recent history we can’t assume these jobs will be replaced either.

In actual fact, many displaced people become unemployed; others are forced into low-paying or part-time jobs, or into work in the gig economy. Technological unemployment has many forms.

The term “technological unemployment” is from John Maynard Keynes’s 1930 lecture, “Economic possibilities for our grandchildren,” where he predicted that in the future, around 2030, the production problem would be solved and there would be enough for everyone, but machines (robots, he thought) would cause “technological unemployment.” There would be plenty to go around, but the means of getting a share in it, jobs, might be scarce.

We are not quite at 2030, but I believe we have reached the “Keynes point,” where indeed enough is produced by the economy, both physical and virtual, for all of us. (If total US household income of $8.495 trillion were shared by America’s 116 million households, each would earn $73,000, enough for a decent middle-class life.) And we have reached a point where technological unemployment is becoming a reality.

The problem in this new phase we’ve entered is not quite jobs, it is access to what’s produced. Jobs have been the main means of access for only 200 or 300 years. Before that, farm labor, small craft workshops, voluntary piecework, or inherited wealth provided access. Now access needs to change again.

However this happens, we have entered a different phase for the economy, a new era where production matters less and what matters more is access to that production: distribution, in other words—who gets what and how they get it.

We have entered the distributive era.

How artificial intelligence can deliver real value to companies

The realities of the distributive era

A new era brings new rules and realities, so what will be the economic and social realities of this new era where distribution is paramount?

1. The criteria for assessing policies will change. The old production-based economy prized anything that helped economic growth. In the distributive economy, where jobs or access to goods are the overwhelming criteria, economic growth looks desirable as long as it creates jobs. Already, unpopular activities such as fracking are justified on this criterion.

Productivity and GDP growth: No longer good measures? Here is a puzzle. Why are the new digital possibilities not creating high productivity figures and high GDP growth? Consider two facts: GDP is the total of goods and services times their price. And very many virtual services, like email, generate unmeasured benefits for the user, cost next to nothing, and are unpriced. So when we replace priced physical services with free virtual ones, GDP falls. Productivity (GDP per worker) falls too. Of course this GDP shrinkage could be allayed in several ways: email services might boost other businesses’ output. And postal workers laid off by email might get jobs that produce more than their old ones. So there are offsets. But overall, virtual services bias GDP downward. A thought experiment makes this point more vividly. Imagine an economy where everything is provided autonomously—your food, your morning coffee, your news, entertainment, all needed services. Everything. And let’s say these autonomous processes cost nothing. Such an economy provides goods and services; everything we need is given. But it has no priced output, no jobs, and no wages. Its GDP would be zero, and therefore productivity would also be zero. Yet we would be fully provided for. This is imaginary of course, but it is what we are heading toward. Certainly there’s no reason as we head toward greater autonomy that either GDP or productivity should grow as they traditionally have. This doesn’t mean the economy is failing to deliver what we need; it means that measuring its success as priced goods and priced services is becoming increasingly problematic—and, in fact, inappropriate.

The criteria for measuring the economy will also change. GDP and productivity apply best to the physical economy and do not count virtual advances properly (see sidebar, “Productivity and GDP growth: No longer good measures?”).

2. Free-market philosophy will be more difficult to support in the new atmosphere. It is based on the popular notion that unregulated market behavior leads to economic growth. I’ve some sympathy with this. Actual economic theory has two propositions. If a market—the airline market, say—is made free and operates according to a host of small-print economic conditions, it will operate so that no resources are wasted. That’s efficiency. Second, there will be winners and losers, so if we want to make everyone better off, the winners (big-hub airlines, in this case) need to compensate the losers: small airlines and people who live in remote places. That’s distribution, and overall everyone is better off.

In practice, whether with international trade agreements or deregulation or freeing up markets, the efficiency part holds at best sort of; often unregulated behavior leads to concentration as companies that get ahead lock in their advantage. And in practice, in the United States and Britain, those who lose have rarely been compensated. In earlier times they could find different jobs, but now that has become problematic. In the distributive era free-market efficiency will no longer be justifiable if it creates whole classes of people who lose.

3. The new era will not be an economic one but a political one. We’ve seen the harsh beginnings of this in the United States and Europe. Workers who have steadily lost access to the economy as digital processes replace them have a sense of things falling apart, and a quiet anger about immigration, inequality, and arrogant elites.

I’d like to think the political upheaval is temporary, but there’s a fundamental reason it’s not. Production, the pursuit of more goods, is an economic and engineering problem; distribution, ensuring that people have access to what’s produced, is a political problem. So until we’ve resolved access we’re in for a lengthy period of experimentation, with revamped political ideas and populist parties promising better access to the economy.

This doesn’t mean that old-fashioned socialism will swing into fashion. When things settle I’d expect new political parties that offer some version of a Scandinavian solution: capitalist-guided production and government-guided attention to who gets what. Europe will find this path easier because a loose socialism is part of its tradition. The United States will find it more difficult; it has never prized distribution over efficiency.

Whether we manage a reasonable path forward in this new distributive era depends on how access to the economy’s output will be provided. One advantage is that virtual services are essentially free. Email costs next to nothing. What we will need is access to the remaining physical goods and personal services that aren’t digitized.

For this we will still have jobs, especially those like kindergarten teaching or social work that require human empathy. But jobs will be fewer, and work weeks shorter, and many jobs will be shared. We will almost certainly have a basic income. And we will see a great increase in paid voluntary activities like looking after the elderly or mentoring young people.

We will also need to settle a number of social questions: How will we find meaning in a society where jobs, a huge source of meaning, are scarce? How will we deal with privacy in a society where authorities and corporations can mine into our lives and finances, recognize our faces wherever we go, or track our political beliefs? And do we really want external intelligence “helping” us at every turn: learning how we think, adjusting to our actions, chauffeuring our cars, correcting us, and maybe even “nurturing” us? This ought to be fine, but it’s like having an army of autonomous Jeeveses who altogether know too much about us, who can anticipate our needs in advance and fulfill them, and whom we become dependent upon.

All these challenges will require adjustments. But we can take consolation that we have been in such a place before. In 1850s Britain, the industrial revolution brought massive increases in production, but these were accompanied by unspeakable social conditions, rightly called Dickensian. Children were working 12-hour shifts, people were huddled into tenements, tuberculosis was rife, and labor laws were scarce. In due time safety laws were passed, children and workers were protected, proper housing was put up, sanitation became available, and a middle class emerged. We did adjust, though it took 30 to 50 years—or arguably a century or more. The changes didn’t issue directly from the governments of the time, they came from people, from the ideas of social reformers, doctors and nurses, lawyers and suffragists, and indignant politicians. Our new era won’t be different in this. The needed adjustments will be large and will take decades. But we will make them, we always do.","(4, 'national debt')"
236,How Preferential Trade Agreements Affect the U.S. Economy - Congressional Budget Office,How Preferential Trade Agreements Affect the U.S. Economy  Congressional Budget Office,"Thu, 29 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiby5nb3YvcHVibGljYXRpb24vNTE5MjTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Congressional Budget Office,"Preferential trade agreements (PTAs) are treaties that remove barriers to trade and set rules for international commerce between two countries or among a small group of countries. PTAs directly affect a country’s economy by altering its flows of trade and investment. Primarily through trade, PTAs indirectly affect other aspects of a country’s economy—such as productivity, output, and employment. As of August 2016, the United States had established 14 PTAs with 20 of its trading partners. This report surveys the economic literature on trade and PTAs and summarizes that literature’s findings on how trade and PTAs have affected the U.S. economy.

How Does Trade Affect the U.S. Economy?

International trade yields several benefits for the U.S. economy. Trade increases competition between foreign and domestic producers. That increase in competition causes the least productive U.S. businesses and industries to shrink; it also enables the most productive businesses and industries in the United States to expand to take advantage of profitable new opportunities to sell abroad and obtain cost savings from greater economies of scale. As a result, trade encourages a more efficient allocation of resources in the economy and raises the average productivity of businesses and industries in the United States. Through that increase in productivity, trade can boost economic output and workers’ average real (inflation-adjusted) wage. In addition, U.S. consumers and businesses benefit because trade lowers prices for some goods and services and increases the variety of products available for purchase.

Not everyone benefits from trade expansion, however. Although increases in trade probably do not significantly affect total employment, trade can affect different workers in different ways. Workers in occupations, businesses, and industries that expand because of trade may make more money, whereas workers in occupations, businesses, and industries that shrink may make less money or experience longer-than-average unemployment. Such losses can be temporary or permanent. Nevertheless, economic theory and historical evidence suggest that the diffuse and long-term benefits of international trade have outweighed the concentrated short-term costs. That conclusion has consistently received strong support from the economics profession.

Why Does the United States Establish Preferential Trade Agreements?

The United States establishes preferential trade agreements for economic and noneconomic reasons. Those agreements enable the United States and its partner countries to realize the economic benefits of increased trade and investment. In addition, the agreements sometimes harmonize laws and regulations which, among other effects, make the costs of operating businesses in other countries more similar to those costs in the United States. An important noneconomic reason for establishing PTAs is to achieve foreign policy goals. Those goals include supporting the economies of U.S. allies and promoting the adoption of preferred domestic policies, such as environmental conservation or stronger workers’ rights.

How Do Preferential Trade Agreements Work?

Preferential trade agreements facilitate trade and investment among member countries. To encourage member countries to trade, PTAs reduce or eliminate barriers to trade, such as import tariffs (taxes that countries impose on foreign-made goods), restrictions on trade in services, and other commercial rules that impede the flow of trade. In addition, PTAs facilitate investment among member countries by easing regulations on foreign investment and providing improved legal protections for foreign investors.

Preferential trade agreements also set commercial rules that, among other effects, narrow differences in the costs of operations among member countries. For example, some PTAs establish minimum labor and environmental standards and protections for intellectual property. If the costs of compliance are high, those types of rule-based reforms can impede trade and investment flows, making some businesses less competitive in foreign markets.

To ensure that member countries comply with the provisions of an agreement, PTAs establish dispute resolution mechanisms. Those mechanisms can take two forms: One provides a legal platform for countries to make claims against other member countries; the other enables investors in member countries to make claims against the governments of other member countries.

How Much Have Preferential Trade Agreements Affected the U.S. Economy and the Federal Budget?

In CBO’s view, the consensus among economic studies is that PTAs have had relatively small positive effects on total U.S. trade (exports plus imports) and, primarily through that channel, on the U.S. economy. The effects have been small because the agreements were mostly between the United States and countries with much smaller economies and because tariffs and other trade barriers were generally low when the agreements took effect (see table below). PTAs have had little effect on the U.S. trade balance (exports minus imports) and have slightly increased flows of foreign direct investment, mostly by encouraging additional U.S. investment in the economies of member countries. As a result, the indirect effects of PTAs on productivity, output, and employment in the United States have also been small and positive. Empirical estimates support that view. But those estimates are uncertain and may be understated, because the effects of nontariff provisions are hard to measure and because issues with data keep researchers from identifying how PTAs affect the service sector.

The effect of PTAs on the federal budget is unclear. In assessing the budgetary impact of previous preferential trade agreements, CBO’s cost estimates have indicated that they would slightly lower the amount of federal revenues received from tariffs. However, those results did not consider how the macroeconomic effects of PTAs might alter the federal budget. Nevertheless, the small size of the effects on output suggests that the overall budgetary effects have also been small.","(0, 'GDP')"

Emerging markets and developing economies have enjoyed good growth over the past two decades. But many countries are still not catching up with the living standards of advanced economies.

At current growth rates, it would take more than 50 years for a typical emerging market economy to close half of its current income gap in living standards, and 90 years for a typical developing economy.

Our research in Chapter 3 of the October 2019 World Economic Outlook finds that implementing major reforms in six key areas at the same time—domestic finance, external finance, trade, labor markets, product markets, and governance—can double the speed of income convergence of the average emerging market and developing economy to the living standards of advanced economies. This could raise output levels by more than 7 percent over a six-year period.

Structural reforms can yield sizable payoffs.

More room for reforms

Policies that change the way governments work—known as structural reforms—are difficult to measure. They often involve policies or issues that are not easy to quantify, such as job protection legislation or the quality of supervision of the domestic banking system.

To address this, the IMF recently developed a comprehensive dataset covering structural regulations in domestic and external finance, trade, and labor and product markets. The data cover a large sample of 90 advanced and developing economies during the past four decades. To the five indicators, we added the quality of governance (for example, how countries control corruption) from the World Gov­ernance Indicators.

The new indicators show that, after the major wave of reforms in the late 1980s and—most importantly—the 1990s, the pace slowed in emerging market and developing economies during the 2000s, especially in low-income developing countries.

While this slowdown reflects the prior generation of reforms, as in advanced economies, there remains ample room for a renewed reform push, particularly in developing economies—notably, across sub-Saharan Africa and, to a lesser extent, in the Middle East and North Africa and the Asia-Pacific region.

Reforms can boost growth and living standards

Based on our empirical research of reforms in 48 current and former emerging markets and 20 developing economies, we find that reforms can yield sizable payoffs. But these gains take time to materialize and vary across different types of regulations. For example, a domestic finance reform of the size that took place in Egypt in 1992 leads to an increase in output of about 2 percent, on average, six years after implementation. We get a similar result for anti-corruption measures, whose effects are sizable in the short run and stabilize at around 2 percent in the medium term. In the other four reforms areas—external finance, trade, product markets, and labor markets—the gains are about 1 percent six years after the reform.

For the average emerging market and developing economy, the results imply that major simultaneous reforms across all six areas considered in this chapter can raise output by more than 7 percent over a six-year period. This would increase annual per capita GDP growth by about 1 percentage point, doubling the average speed of income convergence to advanced-country levels. Model-based analysis—which captures the longer-term effect of reforms and provides insights on the channels through which they affect economic activity—points to output gains about twice as large as the empirical model over the longer term (beyond 6 years).

One channel through which reforms increase output is by reducing informality. For example, lowering barriers to businesses’ entry in the formal sector encourages some informal companies to become formal. In turn, formalization boosts output by increasing companies’ productivity and capital investment. For this reason, the payoff from reforms tends to be larger where informality is pervasive.

Getting the timing, packaging and sequencing right

Some reforms work best when the economy is strong. In good times, reducing layoff costs makes employers more willing to hire new workers, while in bad times it makes them more willing to dismiss existing ones, magnifying the effects of a downturn. Similarly, increasing compe­tition in the financial sector at a time of weak credit demand may push certain financial intermediaries out of business, further weakening the economy.

In countries where the economy is weak, governments may prioritize reforms—such as strengthening product market competition—that pay off regardless of economic conditions, design others to alleviate any short-term costs—such as enacting job protection reforms now with a provision that they will take effect later. These reforms can also be accompanied with monetary or fiscal policy support where possible.

Reforms also work best if properly packaged and sequenced. Importantly, they typically deliver larger gains in countries where governance is stron­ger. This means that strengthening governance can support economic growth and income convergence not just directly by incentivizing more productive formal enterprises to invest and recruit, but also indirectly by magnifying the payoff from reforms in other areas.

Finally, to fulfill their promise of improving living standards, reforms must be supported by redistributive policies that spread the gains widely across the population—such as strong social safety nets and programs that help workers move across jobs. For reforms to be sustainable and therefore effective, they need to benefit not just some, but all.","(0, 'GDP')"

As much as half of the world’s work is unpaid. And most of it is done by women.

This imbalance not only robs women of economic opportunities. It is also costly to society in the form of lower productivity and forgone economic growth. It follows that a fairer allocation of unpaid work would not only benefit women, but would also lead to more efficient work forces and stronger economies.

For these reasons, reducing gender imbalances in unpaid work is part of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

Examples of unpaid work include cooking, cleaning, fetching food or water, and caring for children and the elderly. These tasks are not counted as part of economic activity because they are difficult to measure based on values in the marketplace. Yet their economic value is substantial, with estimates ranging from 10 to 60 percent of GDP.

In our new study, we find that unpaid work declines as economic development increases particularly because there is less time spent on domestic chores. Social institutions and values can constrain the redistribution of unpaid work by preventing men from sharing the burden at home.

Unpaid work declines as economic development increases.

Overworked and underpaid

It’s no secret that women disproportionately shoulder the burden of unpaid work. Less well understood is just how many more unpaid hours women put in than men on a given day. Women do 4.4 hours of unpaid work on average around the world and men only 1.7 hours.

There are large differences across countries.

In Norway, the gap is small, with women doing 3.7 hours of unpaid work, while men contribute 3. On the other extreme, in Egypt, women do 5.4 hours per day of unpaid work and men only 35 minutes. In the US, women do 3.8 hours of unpaid work and men do 2.4 hours.

By not fully engaging women, the economy is misallocating resources, having women do low-productivity tasks at home instead of taking advantage of their full potential in the marketplace. It also misses exploiting the complementarity between women and men in the workplace. The result is lower productivity and economic growth. This gender gap in unpaid work is not just unfair. It is clearly inefficient.

Certainly, some unpaid work is done entirely by choice and the value to society of raising children for societies cannot be disputed. But more than 80 percent of unpaid work hours are devoted to domestic chores aside from child and elder care.

Too often women end up shouldering those domestic chores because of constraints imposed by cultural norms, lack of public services and infrastructure, or absence of family-friendly policies.

Women may also choose to stay at home or work only part-time if the wage in the market is too low and does not represent equal pay for equal work.

Engines of liberation

Policies can help reduce and redistribute unpaid work. In developing economies, measures to improve water supply, sanitation, electricity, and transportation are critical to free women from low-productivity tasks.

UNICEF estimates that women spend 200 million hours per day worldwide simply fetching water. In India, women spend more than an hour every day collecting firewood. Better access to electricity and water and less expensive appliances helped boost female labor force participation in Mexico and Brazil. Expanding internet access to the entire population can help women take advantage of the gig economy and flexible work arrangements.

Governments need to ensure access to education and health care for women. Without proper human capital, women’s possibilities in the labor market are very limited. According to UNESCO, 130 million school-age girls are not in school. It is not only a matter of providing the services, but also guaranteeing their use.

Many families in Pakistan choose not to send girls to school because of security concerns. Enshrining women’s rights in law could help to reshape social institutions and values that prevent access to education and healthcare.

Efficient and flexible labor markets help redistribute unpaid work. Active labor market policies, like those in Switzerland, can facilitate job matching. We find that flexible work arrangements are associated with less female unpaid work and make for a better work-life balance.

All in the family

Family-friendly policies also help. Many Nordic countries invest heavily in early childhood education and care, which allows for high enrollment and fosters women’s ability to return to work after giving birth.

Greater parity in maternal and parental leave policies can raise female labor force participation by smoothing women’s return to work and engaging fathers in care activities early on. Iceland’s parental leave policy is a good example: it sets the length of leave at nine months and earmarks three for each parent.

Reducing and redistributing unpaid work is an economic imperative. Governments must take decisive actions, and the private sector must join in to seize on the large potential gains.","(1, 'employment/wages')"

What do delivery couriers, Uber drivers and TaskRabbits have in common? They're all part of the gig economy, and their work may lead to new labour laws if the government heeds the call for changes made in Matthew Taylor's review.

The Taylor Review, which was published July 11, 2017, called for a new category of worker that gives those in the gig economy some employment benefits and ensures a decent wage. Although it falls short of giving them full-time employee status and the full protections that would bring.

The government has now responded to the Taylor review saying there will be stricter enforcement of holiday and sick pay rights for people working within the gig economy. ""We want to embrace new ways of working,"" business secretary Greg Clark on February 7. Unions have criticised the government's plans saying 1.8 million workers will be left without key rights.

The rapid growth in the gig economy suggests that this is the future of work, raising the question of whether a lack of job security, lower pay and fewer benefits is the future we want to build?

Read more: The hidden dangers of the global gig economy

Why is it called the gig economy?

The gig economy gets its name from each piece of work being akin to an individual 'gig' – although, such work can fall under multiple names. It has previously been called the ""sharing economy"" — mostly in reference to platforms such as Airbnb — and the ""collaborative economy"". However, at its core are app-based platforms that dole out work in bits and pieces — making deliveries, driving passengers or cleaning homes — leading some to prefer the term ""platform economy"".

Not all gig economy roles are based around a technology platform. Gig economy workers can also work for more traditional companies, which have changed how their staffing system operates. Delivery drivers for Hermes, for example, also work on a piece-by-piece delivery basis, though their employer does not have the tech startup origins often associated with this type of work.

What about zero-hour contracts?

Gig-economy work and zero-hour contracts have similarities. Both treat workers as contractors and offer no guarantee of pay, but gig economy roles are normally paid per piece — such as a set rate to deliver a package or drive a fare to a location — while zero-hours contracts are paid hourly, but with no set minimum. Both are the result of companies trying to cut or limit staffing costs, and can leave workers unsure how much they'll earn.

What's the problem with the gig economy?

The companies ruling the gig economy say they bring the flexibility to work whenever you like. Critics — which include many of those working for the companies — argue that not only do workers lack protection and fair pay, but the roles aren't as flexible as they seem, as workers are incentivised or pressured to work when the companies need them.

On top of that, workers aren't paid benefits such as holiday or sick pay, and reports suggest some aren't making minimum wage. A recent one by MP Frank Field suggested some gig economy workers pull in less than £2.50 an hour. That's legally possible because gig workers aren't seen by the companies they work for as employees but contractors — though a court ruling against Uber disagreed with that claim last year.

How can these issues be fixed?

The Taylor Review hoped to address this disconnect. It suggested the government creates a new category of worker known as a ""dependent contractor"" that sits between contractors and those in full employment, and brings with it some benefits and wage protections. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) has also pointed out that when employees are underpaid, the government earns less in taxes and national insurance, and pays out more in credits and benefits. They calculate the loss at billions of pounds a year.

In a speech to the Trades Union Congress in September, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said a Labour government would give gig economy workers similar rights to those in permanent work, including sick pay and maternity pay. His comments, predictably, were welcomed by trade unions who have long-argued that gig economy companies have been running roughshod over workers’ rights for years.

How many people work in the gig economy?

The number is difficult to judge. According to a parliamentary report, 15 per cent of UK workers are self-employed — some five million people. But not all will be in what we consider to be the gig economy, as this also covers traditional freelance roles and contractors.

The Chartered Institute for Professional Development estimates that there are 1.3 million Britons employed in the gig economy, while TUC says that one-in-ten British workers are in ""precarious work"".

244,The Effects of the Partial Shutdown Ending in January 2019 - Congressional Budget Office,The Effects of the Partial Shutdown Ending in January 2019  Congressional Budget Office,"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiby5nb3YvcHVibGljYXRpb24vNTQ5MzfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Congressional Budget Office,"CBO has estimated the effects of the five-week partial shutdown of the government that started on December 22, 2018, and ended on January 25, 2019. This report presents CBO’s findings, which include the following:

CBO estimates that the five-week shutdown delayed approximately $18 billion in federal discretionary spending for compensation and purchases of goods and services and suspended some federal services.

As a result of reduced economic activity, CBO estimates, real (that is, inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2018 was reduced by $3 billion (in 2019 dollars) in relation to what it would have been otherwise. (Such references are in calendar years or quarters unless this report specifies otherwise.) In the first quarter of 2019, the level of real GDP is estimated to be $8 billion lower than it would have been—an effect reflecting both the five-week partial shutdown and the resumption in economic activity once funding resumed.

As a share of quarterly real GDP, the level of real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2018 was reduced by 0.1 percent, CBO estimates. And the level of real GDP in the first quarter of 2019 is expected to be reduced by 0.2 percent. (The effect on the annualized quarterly growth rate in those quarters will be larger.)

In subsequent quarters, GDP will be temporarily higher than it would have been in the absence of a shutdown. Although most of the real GDP lost during the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 will eventually be recovered, CBO estimates that about $3 billion will not be. That amount equals 0.02 percent of projected annual GDP in 2019. In other words, the level of GDP for the full calendar year is expected to be 0.02 percent smaller than it would have been otherwise.

Underlying those effects on the overall economy are much more significant effects on individual businesses and workers. Among those who experienced the largest and most direct negative effects are federal workers who faced delayed compensation and private-sector entities that lost business. Some of those private-sector entities will never recoup that lost income.

All of the estimated effects and their timing are subject to considerable uncertainty. In particular, CBO is uncertain about how much discretionary spending was affected by the partial shutdown, how affected federal employees and contractors adjusted their spending in response to delayed compensation, and how agencies will adjust their spending on goods and services now that funding has resumed.

In CBO’s estimation, the shutdown dampened economic activity mainly because of the loss of furloughed federal workers’ contribution to GDP, the delay in federal spending on goods and services, and the reduction in aggregate demand (which thereby dampened private-sector activity).



CBO’s estimates do not incorporate other, more indirect negative effects of the shutdown, which are more difficult to quantify but were probably becoming more significant as it continued. For example, some businesses could not obtain federal permits and certifications, and others faced reduced access to loans provided by the federal government. Such factors were probably beginning to lead firms to postpone investment and hiring decisions. In addition, risks to the economy were becoming increasingly significant as the shutdown continued. Although their precise effects on economic output are uncertain, the negative effects of such factors would have become increasingly important if the partial shutdown had extended beyond five weeks.","(0, 'GDP')"

Indonesia’s growth at 5 percent highest in large emerging market economies in 2016

External risks, like China’s rebalancing, pose challenges to favorable outlook

Government to continue with reforms to boost investment, growth

Indonesia’s economy continues to register strong growth, thanks in large part to solid economic policies and increased household consumption, says the IMF in its latest report. The country’s growth at 5 percent for 2016—up from 4.8 percent in 2015—remains among the highest in large emerging market economies.

Household consumption—one of the main drivers of growth for Indonesia—is strengthening due to people's improving purchasing power amid low inflation and a stronger rupiah. Still, while strong household consumption should continue to support growth, Indonesia needs more investment to sustain and even accelerate the pace over the medium term.

Continuing with reforms

The government has already started to implement reforms to improve the investment climate and boost growth. These include expanding investment in public infrastructure, reducing the layers of government regulations, and opening up new areas of the economy to private investment. The government’s strategy to strengthen tax collection and broaden the tax base through tax reform will also generate additional revenues to pay for priority government investment.

Indonesia’s youthful workforce has the potential to be one of the country’s most powerful economic levers. Reforms that can help narrow the skills gaps between what employers need and what employees have—such as expanding vocational training opportunities—can help strengthen the economy’s productivity.

Current shifts in the global economy

Indonesia’s positive economic outlook, however, is challenged by global uncertainties, including around policies from the new United States administration, and the possible impact from China’s rebalancing and expected economic slowdown. To best adapt to this new environment, the country needs to stand ready to manage short-term risks and, at the same time, ramp up economic reforms to increase potential growth.","(0, 'GDP')"

Our previous interviews feature This is last article in a series of six interviews with policymakers from Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe. Central bank governors and finance ministers discuss how their countries are doing in terms of catching up to Western Europe. What are the main obstacles for reaching the same living standards in the East as in the West? We conducted the interviews during a conference on economic governance within Europe that was held in Dubrovnik, Croatia, in July 2017.Our previous interviews feature Octavian Armasu , Moldova’s Minister of Finance, Sergiu Cioclea , Governor of the National Bank of Moldova, Bo štjan Jazbec , Governor of the Bank of Slovenia, Martina Dalić , Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy of Croatia, Oleksandr Danyliuk , Minister of Finance of Ukraine, and Bedri Hamza , Governor of the Central Bank of Kosovo at the time of the interview.

Czech Republic: Economy So Far So Good

The Czech Republic is doing well: its growth at 2.4 percent is strong, unemployment at 3.3 percent is the lowest in the European Union, and its government debt is low. Yet the country must continue to improve the quality of its human capital and monitor mortgage loans if growth is to last. We sat down with Jiří Rusnok, Governor of the Czech National Bank to discuss recent developments.

In April, the central bank removed the upper limit of the euro exchange rate after three and a half years because inflation has started to move upwards. What is your experience after the shift?

For three years, we put a cap on the koruna-euro exchange rate as an unorthodox measure at a time of very low inflation, well below our target of two percent. But once we brought inflation back, close to or even slightly above the target, and assessed it to be sustainable, we decided to drop the cap. That was in the beginning of April. Of course, we prepared the market and public beforehand.

Afterwards, in what we saw as a very positive sign, there was no extraordinary volatility on the foreign exchange market involving the koruna. The Czech currency even started to appreciate slightly, and I'd say, unexpectedly. From our perspective, it was a positive move, signaling the beginning of a tighter monetary stance. So far, so good.

The Czech economy is exemplary in its low public debt, and unemployment is relatively low. Nevertheless, some economists say that the country should invest more in human capital.

True, the Czech economy is doing quite well. Growth this year could be close to, or even over three percent of GDP, which is probably slightly above the potential of about 2.5 percent. All the macroeconomic indicators are looking very positive. Of course, we would like to see more investment overall, but our investment cycle is very much linked to the seven-year budgetary cycle of the European Union and the arrival of the EU funds. And we must pay attention to investment in human capital.

Wages are growing vigorously, at about 5 to 6 percent each year. With inflation close to 2 percent, this translates into a significant growth for real wages for the last three years and we expect the trend to continue next year. Public or other investment in education is therefore also a relevant discussion in the Czech Republic.

Some Czech households take out big loans for mortgages now that their wages are growing. Is there a need for the banks to exercise caution?

First of all, I would like to stress that the indebtedness of Czech households is still far below the European standards. You are right that in recent years there has been a significant recovery—if not boom yet—in credit for households, mainly for mortgages. That is because of the very low interest rates and because of the fast-growing wages. It is a very convenient environment to buy apartments and houses.

At the same time, there are some supply constraints. The lack of available properties in the most attractive locations such as Prague, the capital, definitely pushes real estate prices up and therefore some caution is indeed necessary.

The central bank tries to make the public as well as other authorities aware of the potential risks of taking too much debt. We are using some measures in our policies such as countercyclical buffers for the banks and recommendations in the case of some households.

The Czech Republic is not yet part of the eurozone, where membership is a legal requirement for EU members once the adoption criteria are fulfilled. When does your country plan to join the euro area?

It is a topic of a continuous—sometimes hotter, other times cooler—political discussion. I do not see enough political braveness at this time. Over the next five to seven years, I imagine that we would not become a member of the eurozone.

You have been working with the IMF for decades. What has been your experience?

The role of the IMF was crucial during our transition to a market economy in the beginning of the 1990s. Later on, when we did not need financial support any more, we sought technical advice from the IMF.

The Fund’s technical expertise came in very handy with the financial stability assessment program (FSAP). We experienced quite a huge banking crisis in the late 1990s, beginning of 2000s, and when the Czech Republic became one of the countries piloting the IMF's FSAP, it taught us valuable lessons on how to establish up-to-date rules and supervision. Then, we were the first country to ever to publish the entire set of financial stability assessment documents.","(3, 'inflation')"

This essential segment of the U.S. economy also employed more than 3 million people—more than crop production, telecommunication and building construction combined—with over two thirds of those employees in the tourism and recreation sector.

The nation's oceans and Great Lakes continue to fuel economic growth across the U.S. The latest economic figures available are from 2014 and show inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) from the ocean economy (businesses dependent on these natural resources) grew 15.6 percent from the pre-recession levels of 2007, outpacing the U.S. economy as a whole, which grew at 5.8 percent.

This essential segment of the U.S. economy also employed more than 3 million people—more than crop production, telecommunication, and building construction combined—with over two thirds of those employees in the tourism and recreation sector.

These findings are in a new report, titled U.S. Ocean and Great Lakes Economy, 2014, by the NOAA Office for Coastal Management. The report looks at 2005-2014 data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Census Bureau.

The ocean and Great Lakes economy is comprised of six job sectors dependent on natural resources: marine construction; marine transportation; offshore mineral extraction; ship and boat building; and tourism and recreation. These sectors created 75,000 new jobs, growing by 2.5 percent during the reporting period as compared to overall U.S. economic growth of 2.0 percent. In 2014 alone, the ocean and Great Lakes supported:

149,000 business establishments

3.1 million employees

$123 billion in total wages

$352 billion in gross domestic product

The report also shines a light on the deep connections individual sectors have to the Great Lakes and marine resources. Some industry highlights from the report:

Tourism and recreation was the largest sector in terms of ocean economy employment, providing over 2 million jobs.

Offshore mineral extraction sector led the ocean economy in wages and GDP, paying out over $25 billion in wages, and contributing $152 billion in goods and services.

Four sectors paid an average wage per employee above the national average of $51,000—marine construction ($69,000), ship and boat building ($66,000), marine transportation ($72,000), and offshore mineral extraction ($146,000).

NOAA provides a host of economic data from its primary data delivery website, the Digital Coast. Time-series economic data is available for counties, states, regions, and the nation in a wide variety of formats. These data provide nationally consistent information to understand and manage the diverse economic demands placed on our ocean and Great Lakes.","(0, 'GDP')"

With the economy at full employment, the United States will need to gradually remove both fiscal and monetary support, while intensifying efforts to address multiple constraints on its medium-term growth prospects, the IMF says in its latest economic report.

These constraints include weak productivity growth, an aging population, falling labor force participation, an increasingly polarized income distribution, and high levels of poverty. These growing headwinds are made worse by a share of income paid to workers that is nearly 4 percentage points lower than that in the early 2000s, a middle class that has shrunk to its smallest size over the past 30 years, and a potential growth rate that is virtually the lowest since the 1940s.

Trade growth has slowed since 2012 relative both to its strong historical performance and to overall economic growth. This chapter finds that the overall weakness in economic activity, in particular in investment, has been the primary restraint on trade growth, accounting for up to three-fourths of the slowdown. However, other factors are also weighing on trade. The waning pace of trade liberalization and the recent uptick in protection-ism are holding back trade growth, even though their quantitative impact thus far has been limited. The decline in the growth of global value chains has also played an important part in the observed slowdown. The findings suggest that addressing the general weak-ness in economic activity, especially in investment, will stimulate trade, which in turn could help strengthen productivity and growth. In addition, given the subdued global growth outlook, further trade reforms that lower barriers, coupled with measures to mitigate the cost to those who shoulder the burden of adjustment, would boost the international exchange of goods and services and revive the virtuous cycle of trade and growth.

This poses challenges for compilers of the international accounts, and leads to issues of consistency and comparability of measurements across economies, and across macroeconomic datasets for an economy.

To begin addressing coverage data gaps in informal, underground, and illegal activities in the international accounts, the IMF Committee on Balance of Payments Statistics supported the establishment of a Task Force on the Informal Economy (TFIE) at its meeting of October 2017. The TFIE work was centered on identifying “encouraged practices” in data compilation of these activities, building on the conceptual frameworks defined by different international organizations.

The results of the TFIE’s two-year work are presented on this webpage, which disseminates information on the compilation practices of selected economies. The information covers collection and compilation techniques used by these economies to estimate informal, underground, and/or illegal cross-border transactions and positions in their international accounts.

1. Introduction

Good morning—I would like to thank my friend Tom Donohue and the Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness for inviting me to this important event.

When I walked into this magnificent hall this morning, I was struck by the powerful image of the 12 flags. These are the banners of 12 great explorers, who opened new avenues for trade and planted the seeds of commercial and industrial growth in the New World.

That spirit is at the heart of the US Chamber of Commerce, which has been working hard for more than a century to help foster the American dream. The Chamber and the IMF have much in common.

They both take an international perspective; they both advocate for greater collaboration between government and the private sector; and, above all, they both are deeply committed to promoting growth, jobs, and opportunities for all.

So this is a most fitting venue to discuss how to make growth more sustainable and inclusive; how to reduce trade tensions; and how to strengthen confidence and trust—in the economy and institutions.

These are also issues that Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors will discuss next week at the IMF and World Bank’s Spring Meetings here in Washington.

They will confront a changing economic landscape that places a premium on the right kind of policy action.

As President Theodore Roosevelt once put it: “There is every reason why we should face the future seriously, neither hiding from ourselves the gravity of the problems nor fearing to approach these problems with the unbending, unflinching purpose to solve them aright.”[i]

I would like to focus on how we can harness this “unbending purpose” for the benefit of all.

2. The Global Economy: A Delicate Moment

Let me begin with the global economic weather map.

A year ago, I said, “the sun is shining—fix the roof.” Six months ago, I pointed to clouds of risk on the horizon. Today, the weather is increasingly “unsettled”. What do I mean by that?

In January, the IMF projected global growth for 2019 and 2020 at around 3 ½ percent—less than in the recent past, but still reasonable. It has since lost further momentum, as you will see from our updated forecast next week.

Only two years ago, 75 percent of the global economy experienced an upswing. For this year, we expect 70 percent of the global economy to experience a slowdown in growth.

But, to be clear, we do not see a recession in the near term. In fact, we expect some pickup in growth in the second half of 2019 and into 2020.

So you see what I mean by “unsettled”. Indeed, the global economy is at a “delicate moment”.

Global growth has been slowing, largely because of rising trade tensions and financial tightening in the second half of 2018. At the same time, global economic activity is set to benefit from the now more-patient pace of monetary normalization by major central banks—led by the US Fed—and from increased stimulus, in China for example.

These policy responses have supported an easing of financial conditions and increased capital flows to emerging markets, where currencies have strengthened relative to the US dollar.

But, again, to be clear: the expected rebound in global growth later this year is precarious. It is vulnerable to downside risks—including country-related uncertainties, such as Brexit, and broader uncertainties such as high debt in some sectors and countries, tensionsaround trade policy, and a sense of uneasein financial markets.

For example: should there be a sharper-than-expected tightening of financial conditions, it could create serious challenges for many governments and companies in terms of refinancing and debt service—which could amplify exchange rate movements and financial market corrections.

3. Three Areas of Policy Action

So indeed, this is a delicate moment that requires us to “handle with care”. This means that we must not only avoid policy missteps, but also be sure to take the right policy steps.

I see three mutually reinforcing areas of action: In domestic policies; in cross-border policies; and in coordinated efforts to tackle the major global challenges we all face.

Let me touch on each of these:

(a) Domestic Policies to Build More Resilient and Inclusive Economies

First and foremost, policies must provide conditions at home for people to succeed. You might have heard me say “we should fix the roof!”—especially when it comes to structural reforms that can help boost productivity and long-term growth. There is no one-size-fits-all, of course—policies should be customized to meet the needs of individual countries.

Broadly speaking, however, macroeconomic policy should aim to secure growth and stability. Monetary policy should remain accommodative where inflation is below target, and should anchor expectations. Exchange rate flexibility should be used, as needed, to help absorb shocks. And the financial sector should be strengthened and risks reduced by maintaining the impetus of regulatory reform.

The reality is that many economies are not resilient enough. High public debt and low interest rates have left limited room to act when the next downturn comes, which inevitably it will.

For many countries, this implies making smarter use of fiscal policy which, in turn, means striking the right balance between growth, debt sustainability, and social objectives.

As a former Finance Minister, I know that this is not so easily done. It involves building fiscal buffers in good times, while creating enough fiscal space to act in bad times. It involves the continual hard work of upgrading tax systems, mobilizing domestic revenue, prioritizing growth-friendly expenditure, and reducing public debt where needed.

It also involves addressing excessive inequality. Here fiscal policy can play a key role, including through progressive tax measures that would need to be country-specific, and stronger safety nets that can help address dislocations caused by technological change and globalization.

Above all, fiscal policy can help create broader opportunities by providing access to quality education, healthcare, and infrastructure—especially for those who have been left behind or left out. In many countries, this means paying special attention to young people and to women.

This kind of policy action can help build confidence and trust—and overcome perceptions of an unfair sharing of economic benefits.

One area where these perceptions are growing is in the increasing concentration of market power by a few corporate giants.

New IMF analysis[ii] shows that, over the past two decades, rising corporate market power in advanced economies had only a very small effect on investment, output, and the share of national income paid to workers.

But we also found that a small number of highly dynamic companies accounted for the highest price markups. In other words, there is a “winner-takes-most” dynamic at play—especially pronounced in the digital economy.

I am not saying that we currently have a “monopoly problem”. But I am saying that we should take appropriate measures—so that it does not become a problem.

That means reducing barriers to entry for new firms and reforming competition frameworks to ensure a level playing field in all sectors, whether traditional or high-tech.

(b) Cross-Border Efforts to Provide a More Level Playing Field

This brings me to my second priority area for action: cross-border policies. Here there are a wide range of economic issues to be addressed: upgrading financial regulations, improving debt transparency, tackling illicit financial flows—to name a few.

But when it comes to leveling the playing field across borders, no issue looms larger than trade. This is an area where the Chamber and the IMF share much common ground.

We know that, for many decades, trade integration has helped to increase prosperity, reduce poverty, spread new technologies, and boost productivity. For people all over the world, it has reduced the cost of living and created millions of new jobs with higher wages.

At the same time, we know that not everyone has benefitted, that there are distortions in the trade system, and that it needs to be reformed.

We also know that trade barriers are not the answer. More new research from the IMF—about to be released—shows just how important it is to avoid policy missteps in this sphere.

Analyzing experience from 180 countries over the past six decades, we have found that trade integration clearly boosts investment—in plant, machinery, and many other high-job-creating areas. Conversely, trade barriers clearly damage investment and employment.[iii]

This finding is of particular relevance now, at a time when trade tensions could further damage investment—and at a time when investment is already weak.

So, again, it is a delicate moment, and we should be careful.

Specifically, we have looked at what might happen if tariffs[iv] on all goods traded between the US and China went up by 25 percentage points. That alone would reduce annual GDP by up to 0.6 percent in the US and by up to 1.5 percent in China.[v]

These are potentially self-inflicted wounds that should be avoided.

And yet, discussions about trade distortions or unfair practices are often bound up with the concept of bilateral trade deficits and surpluses—and tariffs.

The fact is that, historically, bilateral trade balances have been driven mostly by macroeconomic factors, not bilateral tariffs. In other words, the most effective way to reduce a bilateral trade deficit is to steer clear of tariffs—because tariffs on the goods of one country only divert trade flows to other countries.

Nobody wins a trade war—you might have heard me say that as well! That is why we need to work together to reduce trade barriers and modernize the global trade system—so that we all win.

That means addressing issues such as state subsidies, intellectual property, and data privacy. It also means new deals to unlock the full potential of tradeable services and digital commerce. And it means having rules-based frameworks to ensure fair competition and a level playing field.

So, as we move forward, we need collective action to modernize the key functions of the World Trade Organization: from negotiation, to transparency, to dispute resolution. This will create a stronger and more flexible system.

Of course, leveling the playing field across borders is not only about trade. In recent days—as you may have seen—the IMF has also emphasized the need to improve the framework around international corporate taxation.

I have gone so far as to say the system is fundamentally out-of-date. And I believe that we share the Chamber’s view that it is counterproductive for countries to take a unilateral approach.

We need a cross-border effort.

Reforming international corporate taxation is a challenge for all countries. But developing economies rely especially on corporate tax revenues to fund essential investment in people and infrastructure.

Our analysis shows that non-OECD countries lose about $200 billion a year because companies are able to shift profits to low-tax locations.[vi]

This foregone revenue makes it even more difficult for low-income countries to increase growth, employment —and to meet the Sustainable Development Goals by the agreed target date of 2030.

The good news is that efforts to modernize the international corporate tax system are underway. But there is a lot more to be done. The IMF has put forward some options on how to work together to make the system fairer and fit for the future.

I have so far talked about two priority areas for policy action: domestic and across borders. Let me turn to my third and final priority area: global challenges.

(c) Partnership to Address Global Challenges

These are issues that no country can solve alone—and the list is long: demographics, migration, cyber-risks and, of course, the existential threat of climate change.

On that issue, I know that the Chamber sees great potential in public-private partnership as well as innovation and technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We at the IMF are also deeply engaged on this issue—taking a macroeconomic perspective, of course.

We have focused in particular on pricing carbon emissions and reducing energy subsidies—which amount to about $5.2 trillion per year, or 6.5 percent of global GDP.[vii] Both of these policy tools would go a long way to help mitigate the effects of climate change.

Having just recently become a grand-mother, I must say that the challenge of making the planet a better place for our children—and grand-children—has taken on a special resonance for me.

In my conversations with young people all over the world, I have also learned that climate change is one of the two challenges that they see as of greatest importance to their future.

The other one is corruption.

This, too, is an area where the IMF has stepped up its focus on the macroeconomic effects on our member nations.

The annual cost of bribery alone is over 1.5 trillion dollars[viii]—roughly two percent of global GDP. Money laundering and the financing of terrorism are other serious dimensions of the problem—where the IMF has been working with over a hundred countries.

Our latest research underlines the high fiscal cost of corruption, leading to a massive loss in public revenue and lower-quality public spending. This new analysis confirms what we had all long suspected: corruption lowers growth. It increases inequality. It feeds distrust.

Is there any hope in combatting corruption? We think there is—and we do believe that the right policy responses can make a significant difference.

In a new study, we estimate that within a group of similar economies, less corruption is associated with higher tax revenues—in fact, a very significant difference of up to 4 percentage points of GDP between countries.[ix] Better governance is also associated with higher student test scores and more efficient spending on vital infrastructure: from roads, to schools, to hospitals.

This highlights the potentially huge benefit of curbing corruption—and not only fiscal benefit, but also the potential benefit to society at large.

There is clearly an international dimension to this. Transparency International, for example, recently updated its Corruption Perceptions Index[x]—where 100 means “very clean”. By that measure, two-thirds of all countries score below 50, indicating that they have serious problems in preventing corruption.

Certainly, countries must accept responsibility for what happens within their own borders. But corruption is an international plague. To fight it effectively requires international cooperation.

4. International Policy Cooperation and the IMF

I know that the Chamber recognizes the value of cooperation. Ever since World War II, in country after country, in crisis after crisis, working together has served the world well.

The IMF has often been at the center of those efforts.

During the global financial crisis, the Fund was able to commit over $500 billion to help prevent another Great Depression. In the decade since, we supported economic programs in over 90 countries.

And our work continues. Consider the Fund’s advice to countries to help them open up their markets and encourage investment.

Or think about our recent support for critical country programs in Egypt, Tunisia, and Jordan. Think about Ukraine. Or Argentina.

To do our job effectively, of course, we need to be sufficiently well-resourced into the future. For that, we rely on the support of our 189 member countries. This is another issue that I expect our Ministers and Governors will discuss at our Spring Meetings next week.

I am confident that the support from our membership remains strong.

Conclusion

To conclude, I want to return to the inspirational nature of this magnificent building.

Inscribed on the walls of the original Chamber building was a quote from the great American statesman Daniel Webster. He said:

“Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great interests, and see whether we also, in our day and generation, may not perform something worthy to be remembered.”

At this delicate moment for the global economy, let us work together to do something worthy to be remembered.

Thank you.

Michael has fought to expand the Child Tax Credit by introducing the American Family Act and the Working Families Tax Relief Act, both of which would help low- and middle-income parents afford the costs of raising a child and significantly reduce child poverty.

In 2017, Michael and his colleague, Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), introduced the American Family Act to overhaul the existing Child Tax Credit and make it dramatically more effective for supporting low- and middle-income families with kids and reducing child poverty. After the worst public health crisis in a generation, Michael successfully urged President Biden to expand the Child Tax Credit (CTC) for one year in the pandemic recovery package, known as the American Rescue Plan Act. The expanded credit cut child poverty in the United States nearly in half over six months and provided economic security to tens of millions of families.

Modeled on Michael’s American Family Act, the bill boosted the CTC to $3,000 per child for children ages 6 and older and $3,600 per child for children younger than 6. It also delivered the credit on a monthly basis to help families meet expenses as they arose and made the credit fully refundable so that it no longer excludes an estimated 27 million low-income children, including 350,000 Colorado children, who had been left out of the credit’s full value.","(1, 'employment/wages')"

A woman sells street food at a market stall in Mexico City, Mexico: the country’s spike in crime is hurting small businesses’ profitability (photo: Jonah_Photos/iStock)

[caption id=""attachment_25289"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1024""] [/caption]

The human and economic costs of crime in Mexico have risen to historic highs. 2017 was Mexico’s most violent year on record with over 25,000 homicides—a 50 percent jump since 2015. Economists usually distinguish direct and indirect costs associated with crime.

In our chart of the week from Mexico’s latest economic assessment we show that indirect costs alone are likely to be sizable in Mexico. This is because surveys show that many of the country’s businesses felt like they had no choice but to cancel growth plans, distribution routes or to reduce working schedules amid the rising security concerns.

Crime hurts firm growth

As the chart shows, economic activity for the country’s micro enterprises—the more than 95 percent of Mexico’s businesses that employ only up to ten people, such as family-owned corner bakeries—is most vulnerable. About 13 percent of micro enterprises affected by crime canceled their business expansion while almost a fifth reduced working schedules.

Prevention and Damages add to the cost

Then there are the direct costs. For households and firms combined, the direct costs of crime, such as preventive measures and damages, rose to a staggering 2.5 percent of GDP in 2017.

According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, which tracks crime affecting households and firms, direct crime-related costs for households grew from 1.1 percent of GDP in 2016 to 1.65 percent in 2017. In the case of the country’s businesses, the institute reported that the total amounted to 0.9 percent of GDP.

Micro enterprises affected by crime canceled their business expansion.

Even the largest firms are not safe

While crime disproportionately constrains micro enterprises, it also affects the largest firms. Mexico’s state-owned oil and gas giant, Pemex, is an example that shows even big companies are not immune to criminal acts impairing operations.

The company reports that the number of illegal taps of its pipelines has risen by some 50 percent in 2017 compared to the year before, and about 15-fold since 2010. Pemex estimates that oil theft alone is costing the company $1.6 billion per year, which equals about 0.14 percent of GDP.

These findings emphasize the severe human and economic costs associated with crime. They continue to weigh on Mexico’s goal of higher living standards and lower levels of poverty and inequality.

The sheer magnitude of the economic costs add to the many other reasons why fighting crime needs to be a policy priority in Mexico. Developing policies to reduce crime and implementing them effectively is no simple task. Nevertheless, enhancing the efficiency and quality of law enforcement and judicial institutions would likely have to be a critical part of any policy package to successfully strengthen security in Mexico.","(0, 'GDP')"

“In 2016, commercial and recreational saltwater fishing in the United States generated more than $212 billion in sales and contributed $100 billion to the country’s gross domestic product,” said Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. “These critical industries supported 1.7 million jobs in communities across the country.”

A key piece of the latest report is the jobs, sales, income, and value added to the Gross Domestic Product by the fishing and seafood industries. This provides a measure of how sales from commercial and recreational fishing ripple through state and national economies as each dollar spent generates additional economic effects.

In a single year, economic impacts from recreational fishing grew across the board. Nationally, 9.8 million saltwater anglers took recreational fishing trips in 2016 — a 9 percent increase in anglers from 2015. Saltwater recreational fishing supported 472,000 jobs, generated $68 billion in sales impacts across the economy, and contributed $39 billion to the GDP, all metrics that increased 7 percent from 2015 measurements.

The commercial fishing and seafood industry — harvesters, processors, dealers, wholesalers, and retailers — supported 1.2 million jobs in 2016, generating $144 billion in sales impacts and adding $61 billion to the GDP. The domestic harvest produced $53 billion in sales, up 2 percent from 2015, and supported 711,000 jobs across the entire American economy. Sea scallops had the largest revenue increase in 2016, bringing in $46 million in landings revenue. The domestic lobster industry also performed well, with a $43 million increase in revenue, primarily from the harvest of lobster off the coast of Maine and New England.

“This report illustrates the depth and breadth of fishing and seafood’s contribution to our country’s economy,” said Chris Oliver, assistant NOAA administrator for fisheries. “From sustainably harvesting America’s seafood to casting a line in our coastal waters, the economic impacts of commercial and recreational fishing provide a boon to each and every American community.”

258,How Climate Change Impacts the Economy – State of the Planet - Columbia University,How Climate Change Impacts the Economy – State of the Planet  Columbia University,"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5jbGltYXRlLmNvbHVtYmlhLmVkdS8yMDE5LzA2LzIwL2NsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdlLWVjb25vbXktaW1wYWN0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Columbia University,"The Fourth National Climate Assessment, published in 2018, warned that if we do not curb greenhouse gas emissions and start to adapt, climate change could seriously disrupt the U.S. economy. Warmer temperatures, sea level rise and extreme weather will damage property and critical infrastructure, impact human health and productivity, and negatively affect sectors such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries and tourism. The demand for energy will increase as power generation becomes less reliable, and water supplies will be stressed. Damage to other countries around the globe will also affect U.S. business through disruption in trade and supply chains.

A recent report examined how climate change could affect 22 different sectors of the economy under two different scenarios: if global temperatures rose 2.8˚ C from pre-industrial levels by 2100, and if they increased by 4.5˚ C. The study projected that if the higher-temperature scenario prevails, climate change impacts on these 22 sectors could cost the U.S. $520 billion each year. If we can keep to 2.8˚ C, it would cost $224 billion less. In any case, the U.S. stands to suffer large economic losses due to climate change, second only to India, according to another study.

We are already seeing the economic impacts of the changing climate. According to Morgan Stanley, climate disasters have cost North America $415 billion in the last three years, much of that due to wildfires and hurricanes.

In 2017, Texas’s estimated losses from Hurricane Harvey were $125 billion; Hurricane Sandy caused about $71 billion of damages in 2012. And while it’s not yet possible to directly link climate change to hurricanes, warmer temperatures and higher sea levels are known to enhance their intensity and destructiveness.

“Science advances also give us more detailed spatial information to say which assets and operations are in harm’s way with climate change—for example say, just how many buildings will be inundated due to sea level rise,” said climatologist Radley Horton, associate research professor at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. But the indirect economic impacts may be felt long before an actual disaster.

“For example, it’s not just whether a building is underwater or not,” he said. “What’s important are the harder-to-define things like when does societal risk perception shift? It may be that buildings lose their value before the water actually arrives, once people realize that eventually the water’s going to arrive. We need deeper thinking about the interconnection between physical and social systems.”

Here are some of the many ways that climate change will likely affect our economy, both directly and indirectly.

Agriculture

The sector most vulnerable to climate risk is agriculture.

Environmental economist Geoffrey Heal, a professor in the Columbia Business School, explained that although agriculture makes up a fairly small part of the total U.S. economy, “locally these effects could be big. There are about a dozen states in the Midwest that are very dependent on agriculture and they could take quite a big hit.”

They already have. Extreme rainfall events have increased 37 percent in the Midwest since the 1950s, and this year, the region has experienced above normal amounts of rain and snowmelt that have caused historic flooding.

Many fields have washed away and livestock have drowned; Nebraska alone lost $440 million worth of cattle, and as of March, Iowa had suffered $1.6 billion in losses.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) expects the coming months to bring even more flooding, which could impact our food supply. To date, farmers have only planted 67 percent of their corn crop compared to last June, when they had planted 96 percent. This lost yield could cause prices for animal feed and ethanol to rise, and potentially disrupt marketplaces at home and abroad. As a result of climate change impacts, the Midwest is projected to lose up to 25 percent of its current corn and soybean yield by 2050.

In addition to flooding, increased heat and drought will likely reduce crop yields. According to a 2011 National Academy of Sciences report, for every degree Celsius the global thermostat rises, there will be a 5 to 15 percent decrease in overall crop production. Many commodity crops such as corn, soybean, wheat, rice, cotton, and oats do not grow well above certain temperature thresholds. In addition, crops will be affected by less availability of water and groundwater, increased pests and weeds, and fire risk. And as farmers struggle to stay afloat by finding ways to adapt to changing conditions, prices will likely increase and be passed along to consumers.

Infrastructure

Much of our society’s critical infrastructure is at risk from flooding. “Sea level rise could potentially cause a loss of value of assets in the trillions of dollars—probably anywhere from two to five trillion dollars—by the end of the century,” said Heal. “That’s loss from damage to housing, damage to airports on the coasts, damage to docks, the railway line that runs up and down the East Coast all of which is within a few feet of sea level, damage to I-95 which runs also along the coast. And that’s just the East Coast. If you take a global perspective, this is repeated around the world.” Much of this infrastructure will likely need to be repaired or replaced.

Military bases are also vulnerable. According to a 2016 report published by the Center for Climate and Security policy institute, sea level rise could flood parts of military bases along the East and Gulf coasts for up to three months a year as soon as 2050. Inland military installations near rivers are also vulnerable, because they can overflow with heavy precipitation, which is expected to become more common as the atmosphere warms. Extreme weather will necessitate more maintenance and repair for runways and roads, infrastructure and equipment.

In addition, our communication systems will be affected. A 2018 study found that over 4,000 miles of fiber optic cable as well as data centers, traffic exchanges and termination points — the lifeblood of the global information network — are at risk from sea level rise. According to NOAA’s sea level rise projections, this infrastructure could be underwater by 2033 because most of it is buried along highways and coastlines. When it was built 25 years ago, climate change was not a concern, so while the cables are water resistant, they are not waterproof. New York, Miami and Seattle and large service providers including CenturyLink, Intelliquent and AT&T are most at risk. Threats to the internet infrastructure could have huge implications for businesses in the U.S.

Human health and productivity

If temperatures rise 4.5˚ C by 2090, 9,300 more people will die in American cities due to the rising heat. The annual losses associated with extreme temperature-related deaths alone are projected to be $140 billion.

Increasing warmth and precipitation will also add to the risk of waterborne and foodborne diseases and allergies, and spur the proliferation of insects that spread diseases like Zika, West Nile, dengue and Lyme disease into new territories. Extreme weather and climate-related natural disasters can also exacerbate mental health issues. The most vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, children, low-income communities and communities of color, will be most affected by these health impacts.

Temperature extremes are also projected to cause the loss of two billion labor hours each year by 2090, resulting in $160 billion of lost wages. Because of heat exposure, productivity in the Southeast and Southern Great Plains regions is expected to decline by 3 percent, and some counties of Texas and Florida could lose more than 6 percent of labor hours each year by 2100. According to a 2014 Rhodium Group study, the largest climate change-related economic losses in the U.S. will be from lost labor productivity.

Tourism

Two billion dollars could be lost in winter recreation due to less snow and ice. For example, rapid warming in the Adirondack Mountains could decimate the winter activity sector, which makes up 30 percent of the local economy.

In addition, as water temperatures increase, water quality could suffer due to more frequent and more intense algae blooms, which can be toxic, thus curtailing recreational water activities and freshwater fishing. More frequent and severe wildfires will worsen air quality and discourage tourism. Sea level rise could submerge small islands and coastal areas, while deforestation and its destructive impacts on biodiversity could make some tourist destinations less attractive.

Businesses and the financial market

Climate change and its impacts across the globe will threaten the bottom line of businesses in a variety of ways. The frequency and intensity of extreme weather, both in the U.S. and in other countries, can damage factories, supply chain operations and other infrastructure, and disrupt transport. Drought will make water more expensive, which will likely affect the cost of raw materials and production. Climate volatility may force companies to deal with uncertainty in the price of resources for production, energy transport and insurance. And some products could become obsolete or lose their market, such as equipment related to coal mining or skiing in an area that no longer has snow.

Whether in the U.S. or abroad, new regulations such as carbon pricing and subsidies that favor a competitor may affect a business’s bottom line. A company’s reputation could also suffer if it’s seen as doing something that hurts the environment. And investors and stakeholders are increasingly worried about the potential for “stranded assets”—those that become prematurely obsolete or fall out of favor, and must be recorded as a loss, such as fossil fuels that many believe should stay in the ground or real estate in a newly designated flood plain.

In 2018, the Carbon Disclosure Project asked more than 7,000 companies to assess their financial risks from climate change. The CDP found that, unless they took preemptive measures, 215 of the world’s 500 biggest companies could lose an estimated one trillion dollars due to climate change, beginning within five years. For example, Alphabet (Google’s parent company) will likely have to deal with rising cooling costs for its data centers. Hitachi Ltd.’s suppliers in Southeast Asia could be disrupted by increased rainfall and flooding. Some companies have already been impacted by climate change-related losses. Western Digital Technologies, maker of hard disks, suffered enormous losses in 2011 after flooding in Thailand disrupted its production.

PG&E became liable for fire damages and had to file for bankruptcy after its power lines sparked California’s deadliest wildfire last fall. And GE cost its investors $193 billion between 2015 and 2018 because it overestimated demand for natural gas and underestimated the transition to renewable energy.

“The movement away from fossil fuels will have a big impact which could affect banks and investment firms that have relationships with the fossil fuel industry,” said Heal. “For example, the stock market value of the U.S. coal industry in 2011 was something like $37 billion. Today it’s about $2 billion. So anybody that lent a lot of money to the coal industry 10 years back would be in trouble. One of the things worrying those in the financial field is that this could happen to the oil and gas industry. So people who have invested in them or lent money to them are potentially at risk.”

Climate change and opportunity

The good news is that climate change also presents business opportunities. The Carbon Disclosure Project reported that 225 of the world’s 500 biggest companies believe climate change could generate over $2.1 trillion in new business prospects.

There will be more opportunity in clean energy, resilient and green buildings, and energy efficiency. Hybrid and electric vehicle production and the electric public transit sector are expected to grow. Construction of green infrastructure and more resilient coastal infrastructure could create many new jobs. Carbon capture and sequestration and uses of captured CO2 present opportunities, especially in light of the new 45Q federal tax credits. In addition, there are forward-thinking new businesses—witness the dramatic rise of Beyond Meat, the company selling plant-based burgers at Carl’s Jr. and A&W.

As the Arctic sea ice melts, new shipping lines will open up for trade, substantially cutting transport time. The warming Arctic could also offer more prospects for oil and gas drilling. Weather satellites and radar technology will be in demand to monitor extreme weather. Air conditioning and cooling products will be needed around the world. Biotech companies are developing new crops that are resistant to climate change impacts. Pharmaceutical companies expect increased demand for drugs to combat diseases such as malaria and dengue and other infectious diseases. And the market for military equipment and private security services may expand because the scarcity of resources could trigger civil unrest and conflict.

What individuals, businesses and governments can do to protect themselves

How much climate change will hurt the economy depends on what measures we take to adapt to and prepare for it.

Individuals

Individuals need to consider the implications of climate change when choosing where to spend and invest their money. And be aware that while a particular risk may not seem to be factored into prices yet, things could turn on a dime when the realization of risk sinks in, resulting in a massive redistribution of wealth. So it’s best not to buy or move to an area near wild lands, which have a higher risk of wildfires. Don’t move into a flood zone or buy real estate in an area that’s vulnerable to sea level rise. And in any case, purchase flood and fire insurance, and diversify your investments.

Individuals should also think about different opportunities in terms of new places that people are moving to. And, if possible, people who work outdoors in construction, agriculture or tourism should consider alternative jobs within the sector or new industries to work in.

Businesses and financial entities

Businesses need to scrutinize their operations carefully. “There’s a groundswell towards the view that any companies that fail to study their exposure to extreme weather and fail to disclose the types of vulnerabilities, including indirect ones, are going to have a hard time in the future,” said Horton. “Are companies looking at what’s coming down the road and making strategies to deal with it? I think investors are going to demand that and the companies that don’t do that are going to have trouble getting underwriting, getting infrastructure funded by the Moody’s of the world, and getting insurance.” He added that he’s seen a change in the last three or four years in what his students are demanding and believes that young people in the future will not work for companies that are not thinking about climate change.

Banks and funds need to analyze where their investments are and see if they are vulnerable to climate change. Have they invested in someone who has coastal property, or given a loan to a fossil fuel company or in agriculture operations that might be affected by climate change? Sixty-three percent of financial risk managers surveyed now believe climate change is a major concern. As a result, “The total value of funds that have integrated environmental, social and governance factors into their investment process has more than quadrupled since 2014, rising to $485 billion as of April,” reported the Wall Street Journal.

Governments

Governments should proactively think about the risks their communities face before disaster strikes.

They should be investing in resiliency measures such as hardening infrastructure, improving water resources, building redundancy into important systems, moving people out of harm’s way and improving health care services. “You want to do it before the disaster but you also need to be cognizant that the only time people will listen seems to be right after a disaster,” said Horton. “Those are also the times when money’s available to rebuild.”

Government leaders are currently debating whether the country can afford the Green New Deal (an ambitious plan to address climate change) or something like it. The question should be, ‘can we afford not to afford it?’ Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, a professor at Columbia University, wrote in an op ed, “We will pay for climate breakdown one way or another, so it makes sense to spend the money now to reduce emissions rather than wait until later to pay a lot more for the consequences… It’s a cliché, but it’s true: An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”","(4, 'national debt')"

Despite rising trade tensions and volatility in emerging economies throughout 2018, Vietnam’s economy saw broad-based growth and low inflation. Government spending and debt remained in check and bank capital rules were strengthened. Current economic risks relate to geopolitics, trade policy uncertainty, and domestic reform implementation. Looking ahead to the longer term, Vietnam will face risks related to aging, climate change, and digitalization.

Extensive market-oriented and outward-looking economic policies have helped Vietnam achieve sustained and inclusive economic growth. To maintain growth and raise its quality, Vietnam needs to modernize economic institutions, especially in terms of fiscal and monetary management, and continue with market-oriented and outward-looking reforms. In practice, continued tightening of credit policies, developing capital markets, and building a modern market infrastructure with adequate tools for financial system supervisors and regulators, would help enhance the financial sector’s ability to support sustainable growth.

In recent years, Vietnam has managed to halt the increase in public debt and create some fiscal space. The more favorable fiscal position provides the authorities with the means to step in should downside risks materialize. Conversely, if growth surprises on the upside, existing debt could be paid down at a faster pace. Recapitalization of Vietnam’s state-owned commercial banks should also be a priority, and the country’s ongoing efforts to tackle corruption provide an opportunity to strengthen the rule of law.

261,The Five Characteristics of an Inclusive Economy: Getting Beyond the Equity-Growth Dichotomy - The Rockefeller Foundation,The Five Characteristics of an Inclusive Economy: Getting Beyond the Equity-Growth Dichotomy  The Rockefeller Foundation,"Tue, 13 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yb2NrZWZlbGxlcmZvdW5kYXRpb24ub3JnL2luc2lnaHRzL3BlcnNwZWN0aXZlL2ZpdmUtY2hhcmFjdGVyaXN0aWNzLWluY2x1c2l2ZS1lY29ub215LWdldHRpbmctYmV5b25kLWVxdWl0eS1ncm93dGgtZGljaG90b215L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Rockefeller Foundation,"The concept that growth will “trickle down” to the poor and most disadvantaged among us has been proven to be fundamentally flawed. Instead, we have learned that when we invest in making economies more equitable from the bottom up, or the middle class out, economic growth is likely to be better for everyone’s pocketbooks, for longer periods.

But while growth and equity are critical ingredients for a more inclusive economy, they direct us away from a more constructive and nuanced conversation about other elements of what makes an economy more inclusive, particularly for the poor and vulnerable. Important, too, is who participates in the economy—as workers, consumers, and business owners—whether growth is lasting and sustainable, whether people have an equal shot at economic opportunities, and if there’s some minimum level of security and predictability associated with those opportunities. These questions are particularly important in rapidly-changing demographic, social, environmental and economic environments (i.e. today).

What is an inclusive economy, and how do we know if we’re making progress towards it, globally, nationally, locally and across our incredibly different contexts?

The Foundation believes that an inclusive economy is one in which there is expanded opportunity for more broadly shared prosperity especially for those facing the greatest barriers to advancing their well-being.

Quite simply, there are more opportunities for more people. Based on a broad range of input from experts, academics, peers, and public opinion, the Foundation defines inclusive economies by five inter-related characteristics: participation, equity, growth, sustainability, and stability.











In a new report by researchers Chris Benner and Manuel Pastor (authors of Growth, Equity and Community (2015)), the researchers took the definition above and identified an impressive list of 15 sub-categories and 57 indicators associated with each of these five characteristics (executive summary here). “Inclusive Economy Indicators: Framework & Indicator Recommendations” introduces each characteristic and how one might go about measuring them given the data that is generally available.

The five characteristics of an inclusive economy are defined by the Foundation as the following:

Participation– People are able to participate fully in economic life and have greater say over their future. People are able to access and participate in markets as workers, consumers and business owners. Transparency around and common knowledge of rules and norms allow people to start a business, find a job, or engage in markets. Technology is more widely distributed and promotes greater individual and community well-being. Equity-More opportunities are available to enable upward mobility for more people. All segments of society, especially poor or socially disadvantaged groups, are able to take advantage of these opportunities. Inequality is declining rather than increasing. People have equal access to a more solid economic foundation, including equal access to adequate public goods, services and infrastructure, such as public transit, education, clean air and water. Growth– An economy is increasingly producing enough goods and services to enable broad gains in well-being and greater opportunity. Good job and work opportunities are growing and incomes are increasing, especially for the poor. Economic systems are transforming for the betterment of all, including and especially poor and excluded communities. Economic growth and transformation is not only captured by aggregate measures of economic output (such as GDP), but must include and be measured by other outcomes that capture overall well-being. Stability- Individuals, communities, businesses and governments have a sufficient degree of confidence in their future and an increased ability to predict the outcome of their economic decisions. Individuals, households, communities and enterprises are secure enough to invest in their future. Economic systems are increasingly resilient to shocks and stresses, especially to disruptions with a disproportionate impact on poor or vulnerable communities. Sustainability– Economic and social wealth is sustained over time, thus maintaining inter-generational well-being. Economic and social wealth is the social worth of the entire set of assets that contribute to human well-being, including human produced (manufactured, financial, human, social) and natural capital. In the case of natural capital, human use must preserve or restore nature’s ability to produce the ecosystem of goods and services that contribute to human well-being. Decision-making must thus incorporate the long-term costs and benefits, and not merely the short-term gains, of human use of our full asset base.

[The characteristics were originally posted by the Brookings Institution Metropolitan Policy Program, in an experimental analysis of economic inclusion based on preliminary measures of inclusion, using U.S. metro areas as a test case.]

Benner and Pastor continue to work with the Foundation to think about how one might measure each of these characteristics globally, at the national and sub-national level, and across various markets (e.g. financial, dairy, coffee, electricity). More important than metrics and measurement, however, we seek to fundamentally expand the conversation about what an inclusive economy is and how to achieve it. How are people’s lives changing because of the presence, or the lack thereof, of each of these characteristics? How do we know?

There is no magic recipe, but at least we know we’re closer to having the right ingredients in the mix.","(0, 'GDP')"
262,4 myths about how immigrants affect the U.S. economy - PBS NewsHour,4 myths about how immigrants affect the U.S. economy  PBS NewsHour,"Fri, 02 Nov 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBicy5vcmcvbmV3c2hvdXIvZWNvbm9teS9tYWtpbmctc2Vuc2UvNC1teXRocy1hYm91dC1ob3ctaW1taWdyYW50cy1hZmZlY3QtdGhlLXUtcy1lY29ub2150gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGJzLm9yZy9uZXdzaG91ci9hbXAvZWNvbm9teS9tYWtpbmctc2Vuc2UvNC1teXRocy1hYm91dC1ob3ctaW1taWdyYW50cy1hZmZlY3QtdGhlLXUtcy1lY29ub215?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,PBS NewsHour,"President Donald Trump has been stoking fears about immigrants in the days leading up to the midterm elections. He’s tweeted anti-immigrant ads and threatened to revoke birthright citizenship, something lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have said would be unconstitutional, as he campaigns to drive up Republican turnout.

In a Thursday speech, Trump, a vocal critic of illegal immigration long before he reached the White House, claimed it costs the U.S. billions of dollars each year.

“Illegal immigration hurts Americans workers, burdens American taxpayers and undermines public safety, and places enormous strains on local schools, hospitals and communities in general, taking precious resources away from the poorest Americans who need them most,” Trump said.

Immigration has an overall positive impact on the long-run economic growth in the U.S.

While Trump’s rhetoric has lately focused on unauthorized immigrants, his policies have targeted legal immigration as well. Under his administration, refugee admissions in 2017 dropped to their lowest since at least 2002. Trump signed an executive order tightening restrictions on HB1 visas for skilled immigrants. He has pushed for a merit-based immigration system, and his administration has proposed cutting public benefits to legal immigrants.

Trump’s characterization of immigrants, as people who drain public resources, however, is not backed by the data. Unauthorized immigrants aren’t usually eligible for federal benefits, for instance, and multiple studies have found that immigrants help the economy grow.

READ MORE: Trump retweets false claim on immigrant aid

Here are some of the most widespread myths about how immigrants affect the U.S. economy, and the research that refutes them.

Myth #1: Immigrants take more from the U.S. government than they contribute

Fact: Immigrants contribute more in tax revenue than they take in government benefits

A 2017 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found immigration “has an overall positive impact on the long-run economic growth in the U.S.”

How that breaks down is important.

First-generation immigrants cost the government more than native-born Americans, according to the report — about $1,600 per person annually. But second generation immigrants are “among the strongest fiscal and economic contributors in the U.S.,” the report found. They contribute about $1,700 per person per year. All other native-born Americans, including third generation immigrants, contribute $1,300 per year on average.

It is difficult to determine the exact cost or contribution of unauthorized immigrants because they are harder to survey, but the study suggests they likely have a more positive effect than their legal counterparts because they are, on average, younger and do not qualify for public benefits.

It’s also important to note that less-educated immigrants tend to work more than people with the same level of education born in the U.S. About half of all U.S.-born Americans with no high school diploma work, compared to about 70 percent of immigrants with the same education level, Giovanni Peri, an economics professor at the University of California, Davis, said in a recent interview with PBS NewsHour.

WATCH:Proposed immigration policy penalizes legal residents for use of public benefits

In general, more people working means more taxes — and that’s true overall with undocumented immigrants as well. Undocumented immigrants pay an estimated $11.6 billion a year in taxes, according to the Institute on Taxation & Economic Policy.

Undocumented immigrants pay an estimated $11.6 billion a year in taxes.

Immigrants are also less likely to take public benefits than the native-born population for two reasons.

First, to receive most public benefits under the social safety net, immigrants must be lawful permanent residents for at least five years.

There are approximately 9 million immigrants that fit that definition in the U.S. Of those, many would not qualify for welfare or other programs because their incomes are too high.

“While it is really important to ensure that immigrants and their children have access to the safety net, there are already a lot of eligibility barriers in place,” said Hamutal Bernstein, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute.","(1, 'employment/wages')"

Sharing isn't new. Giving someone a ride, having a guest in your spare room, running errands for someone, participating in a supper club -- these are not revolutionary concepts. What is new, in the ""sharing economy,"" is that you are not helping a friend for free; you are providing these services to a stranger for money. In The Sharing Economy: The End of Employment and the Rise of Crowd-Based Capitalism, Professor Arun Sundararajan explains the transition to what he describes as ""crowd-based capitalism"" -- a new way of organizing economic activity that may supplant the traditional corporate-centered model. As peer-to-peer commercial exchange blurs the lines between the personal and the professional, how will the economy, government regulation, what it means to have a job and our social fabric be affected?Drawing on extensive research and numerous real-world examples -- including Airbnb, Lyft, Uber, Etsy, TaskRabbit, France's BlaBlaCar, China's Didi Kuaidi and India's Ola, Professor Sundararajan explains the basics of crowd-based capitalism. He describes the intriguing mix of ""gift"" and ""market"" in its transactions, demystifies emerging blockchain technologies and clarifies the dizzying array of emerging on-demand platforms. He considers how this new paradigm changes economic growth and the future of work. Will we live in a world of empowered entrepreneurs who enjoy professional flexibility and independence? Or will we become disenfranchised digital laborers scurrying between platforms in search of the next wedge of piecework?

The public’s agenda for the president and Congress is only modestly different from a year ago, but it reflects a continued evolution of the national agenda.

Improving the economy (70% top priority) remains among the public’s highest priorities, but its prominence has waned significantly in recent years. In 2011, following the Great Recession, 87% called it a top priority. And as public ratings of the employment situation have grown increasingly positive, 50% now say improving the job situation should be a top priority; in each of the previous 10 years, majorities cited jobs as a top priority, including 84% who said this in 2011 and 68% who said this as recently as 2017.

Most (67%) continue to say defending the country from future terrorist attacks is a top priority, though this is one of the lowest shares citing the issue since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and far lower than the roughly eight-in-ten who called it a top priority through much of the early to mid-2000s.

As economic and security concerns have become less prominent, the domestic issues of reducing health care costs (69% top priority) and improving the educational system (68%) now rank among the top tier of public priorities. About two-thirds also say that taking steps to make the Social Security (67%) and Medicare (67%) systems financially sound are top priorities for the country.

One issue that’s not a major concern for the public: taking steps to reduce the budget deficit. Just 48% say reducing the deficit should be a top priority for the president and Congress this year. Concern over the budget deficit is much less widespread than it was during Barack Obama’s administration. In 2013, 72% of the public – including 81% of Republicans and 65% of Democrats – said reducing the deficit should be a top priority.

The Pew Research Center survey, conducted Jan. 9-14 among 1,505 adults, finds that Republicans and Democrats continue to stake out markedly different priorities for the country.

Majorities of both parties place top priority on strengthening the economy, but a significantly larger share of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (79%) than Democrats and Democratic leaners (64%) say this.

The pattern is the reverse when it comes to reducing health care costs, improving the educational system and taking steps to make the Medicare system financially sound; in all three cases, larger majorities of Democrats than Republicans call these issues top priorities for the country.

Partisans are even further apart when it comes to defending the country from future terrorist attacks: A large majority of Republicans (83%) calls this a top priority for the country, compared with a about half of Democrats (53%). And while most Republicans place top priority on strengthening the military (65%) and dealing with immigration (68%), fewer than half of Democrats say the same.

By contrast, a majority of Democrats (71%) place the highest priority on dealing with the problems of poor and needy people, compared with 49% of Republicans.

When it comes to the environment, Democrats are 43 percentage points more likely than Republicans to say protecting the environment should be a top priority (74% vs. 31%) and 46 points more likely to call global climate change a top priority (67% vs. 21%).

Taking steps to make the Social Security system financially sound is one of the only issues where comparable majorities of Republicans (68%) and Democrats (65%) say this should be a top priority for the country.

As the public stakes out its agenda for the president and Congress, Americans increasingly see a big difference in what the two parties stand for. For the first time since the question was first asked more than two decades ago, more than half (54%) now say there is a great deal of difference in what the Democratic and Republican parties stand for, compared with smaller shares who say there is a fair amount of difference (30%) or hardly any (13%). The share that sees a great deal of difference between the two parties is up from 45% who said this in 2015 and from just 35% who said this in 2007.

In a divided Washington, the public has low expectations for partisan cooperation in the coming year. About seven-in-ten (71%) think Republicans and Democrats in Washington will bicker and oppose one another more than usual this year; just 21% expect them to work together more than usual. This is one of the most pessimistic year-ahead outlooks over the past several administrations, matching the 71% who expected more partisan opposition in 2015, following the 2014 midterm elections. Majorities of both Republicans (78%) and Democrats (67%) think partisans in Washington will bicker and oppose one another more than usual this year.

While the public expects greater discord between two parties they view as far apart, rank-and-file Republicans and Democrats see their own parties as united. Overall, 55% of Republicans and Republican leaners describe the GOP as mostly united on issues and its vision for the future.

This marks a major shift from October of 2017, when most Republicans (63%) said their party was divided.

Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, 63% describe the Democratic Party as united in its views on issues and vision for the future; in the fall of 2017, 56% said this.

Economic issues are now lower priorities for Republicans and Democrats

Strengthening the economy continues to rank as a top issue for 70% of the public overall – including nearly eight-in-ten Republicans (79%) and 64% of Democrats. While little changed from last year, both parties are now considerably less likely to cite the economy as a top priority than they were in the years following the Great Recession. In 2013, 87% of both Republicans and Democrats said improving the economy should be a top priority.

Over the past year, the importance of improving the job situation has declined among both Republicans and Democrats. A year ago, 66% of Republicans and Republican leaners said improving the job situation was a top priority for Congress and the president. Today, roughly half say this (52%) – a 14 percentage point drop.

There has been a more modest decline in the share of Democrats citing jobs as a top priority: 50% now say this, down from 58% a year ago.

Wide partisan gap over importance of strengthening military

Today, 83% of Republicans and Republican leaners say defending the country from future terrorist attacks should be a top priority for the president and Congress this year. By contrast, only about half of Democrats (53%) say the same.

The share of Republicans giving top priority to defending the country from terror attacks has not changed much in recent years, but the share of Democrats saying this has declined significantly. In 2017, for instance, about seven-in-ten Democrats (72%) viewed defending the country from future terrorist attacks as a top priority for the president and Congress.

As has been the case for the last several years, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to say strengthening the U.S. military should be a top priority: 65% of Republicans say this, compared with 31% of Democrats.

Long-term changes in the public’s priorities

The public’s priorities have shifted over time and many issues are viewed differently today than they were at different moments over the past decade.

Economic issues have declined as top priorities for the public over the last several years. The share viewing “improving the job situation” as a top priority has fallen 34 percentage points since 2011 – and 12 points since last year alone.

Strengthening the nation’s economy and reducing the budget deficit have also declined in the last eight years, although less sharply.

The share saying global climate change should be prioritized has increased substantially since 2011; then, just 26% of Americans said it should be a top priority for the president and Congress. Today, 44% say it should be a top priority.

Other issues that are given greater priority today than in 2011 include reducing health care costs, dealing with the problems of poor and needy people, protecting the environment and improving transportation infrastructure.

Public expects more partisan division in 2019

The public takes a deeply pessimistic view of the prospects for partisan cooperation in the coming year. About seven-in-ten (71%) say they think Republicans and Democrats in Washington will bicker and oppose one another more than usual this year; far fewer (21%) think they will work together to solve problems more than usual.

The share that expects greater partisan opposition in Washington is 10 points higher than it was in January 2017, following Donald Trump’s presidential victory. It matches a high of 71% from January 2015, following the 2014 midterm elections.

Nearly eight-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners (78%) expect partisans in Washington to bicker and oppose one another more than usual this year. A slightly smaller majority of Democrats and Democratic leaners (67%) also take this view.

Views of the parties’ ideological directions

Looking ahead, most Republicans want to see their party move in a more conservative direction. Nearly six-in-ten Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters (58%) say they want the GOP to move in a more conservative direction, compared with 38% who want it to move in a more moderate direction. Republican views on their preferred ideological direction for the party are about the same as they have been following other recent midterm and presidential elections.

Among Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters, somewhat more say they want the Democratic Party to move in a more moderate (53%) than more liberal (40%) direction. These views are about the same as they were following the 2014 midterm elections. In November 2016, after Trump’s presidential election victory, a somewhat greater share of Democrats (49%) wanted the party to head in a more liberal direction.

Favorability ratings of the Republican and Democratic parties

The Democratic Party continues to receive slightly higher favorability ratings than the Republican Party – though neither party is rated favorably by more than half of the public.

Overall, 49% have a favorable view of the Democratic Party, compared with about as many (47%) who hold an unfavorable view. Ratings of the Democratic Party have ticked down from September of last year (53%) but are comparable to where they have been at other points in the recent past.

Views of the Republican Party tilt negative, on balance: 54% hold an unfavorable view of the GOP, while 42% view the party favorably. Ratings of the Republican Party have changed little in recent years.","(4, 'national debt')"

This is not surprising given that AI might usher in radical—arguably unprecedented—changes in the way people live and work. The AI revolution is not in its infancy, but most of its economic impact is yet to come.

New research from the McKinsey Global Institute attempts to simulate the impact of AI on the world economy. First, it builds on an understanding of the behavior of companies and the dynamics of various sectors to develop a bottom-up view of how to adopt and absorb AI technologies. Second, it takes into account the likely disruptions that countries, companies, and workers are likely to experience as they transition to AI. There will very probably be costs during this transition period, and they need to be factored into any estimate. The analysis examines how economic gains and losses are likely to be distributed among firms, employees, and countries and how this distribution could potentially hamper the capture of AI benefits. Third, the research examines the dynamics of AI for a wide range of countries—clustered into groups with similar characteristics—with the aim of giving a more global view.

The analysis should be seen as a guide to the potential economic impact of AI based on the best knowledge available at this stage. Among the major findings are the following:

There is large potential for AI to contribute to global economic activity

The McKinsey Global Institute looked at five broad categories of AI: computer vision, natural language, virtual assistants, robotic process automation, and advanced machine learning. Companies will likely use these tools to varying degrees. Some will take an opportunistic approach, testing only one technology and piloting it in a specific function (an approach our modeling calls adoption). Others might be bolder, adopting all five and then absorbing them across the entire organization (an approach we call full absorption). In between these two poles, there will be many companies at different stages of adoption; the model also captures this partial impact.

By 2030, the average simulation shows that some 70 percent of companies might have adopted at least one type of AI technology but that less than half will have fully absorbed the five categories. The pattern of adoption and full absorption might be relatively rapid—at the high end of what has been observed with other technologies.

Several barriers might hinder rapid adoption and absorption (see video, “A minute with the McKinsey Global Institute: Challenges of adopting automation technology”). For instance, late adopters might find it difficult to generate impact from AI, because front-runners have already captured AI opportunities and late adopters lag in developing capabilities and attracting talent.

Nevertheless, at the global average level of adoption and absorption implied by our simulation, AI has the potential to deliver additional global economic activity of around $13 trillion by 2030, or about 16 percent higher cumulative GDP compared with today. This amounts to 1.2 percent additional GDP growth per year. If delivered, this impact would compare well with that of other general-purpose technologies through history.

A number of factors, including labor automation, innovation, and new competition, affect AI-driven productivity growth. Micro factors, such as the pace of adoption of AI, and macro factors, such as the global connectedness or labor-market structure of a country, both contribute to the size of the impact.

Our simulation examined seven possible channels of impact. The first three relate to the impact of AI adoption on the need for, and mix of, production factors that have direct impact on company productivity. The other four are externalities linked to the adoption of AI related to the broad economic environment and the transition to AI. We acknowledge that these seven channels are not definitive or necessarily comprehensive but rather a starting point based on our current understanding and trends currently under way (Exhibit 1).

1

The impact of AI might not be linear but could build up at an accelerating pace over time. Its contribution to growth might be three or more times higher by 2030 than it is over the next five years. An S-curve pattern of adoption and absorption of AI is likely—a slow start due to the substantial costs and investment associated with learning and deploying these technologies, then an acceleration driven by the cumulative effect of competition and an improvement in complementary capabilities alongside process innovations.

It would be a misjudgment to interpret this “slow burn” pattern of impact as proof that the effect of AI will be limited. The size of benefits for those who move early into these technologies will build up in later years at the expense of firms with limited or no adoption.

Section 2

A key challenge is that adoption of AI could widen gaps among countries, companies, and workers

Although Al can deliver a boost to economic activity, the benefits are likely to be uneven.

How AI could affect countries

Potentially, AI might widen gaps between countries, reinforcing the current digital divide. Countries might need different strategies and responses as AI-adoption rates vary.

Leaders of AI adoption (mostly in developed countries) could increase their lead over developing countries. Leading AI countries could capture an additional 20 to 25 percent in net economic benefits, compared with today, while developing countries might capture only about 5 to 15 percent. Many developed countries might have no choice but to push AI to capture higher productivity growth as their GDP-growth momentum slows—in many cases, partly reflecting the challenge due to aging populations. Moreover, in these economies, wage rates are high, which means that there is more incentive to substitute labor with machines than there is in low-wage, developing countries.

In contrast, developing countries tend to have other ways, including catching up with best practices and restructuring their industries, to improve their productivity. Therefore, they might have less incentive to push for AI (which, in any case, might offer them a relatively smaller economic benefit than it does advanced economies). Some developing countries might prove to be exceptions to this rule. For instance, China has a national strategy in place to become a global leader in the AI supply chain and is investing heavily.

How AI could affect companies

It is possible that AI technologies could lead to a performance gap between front-runners (companies that fully absorb AI tools across their enterprises over the next five to seven years) and nonadopters (companies that do not adopt AI technologies at all or have not fully absorbed them in their enterprises by 2030).

At one end of the spectrum, front-runners are likely to benefit disproportionately. By 2030, they could potentially double their cash flow (economic benefit captured minus associated investment and transition costs). This implies additional annual net cash-flow growth of about 6 percent for longer than the next decade. Front-runners tend to have a strong starting IT base, a higher propensity to invest in AI, and positive views of the business case for AI.

At the other end of the spectrum, nonadopters might experience around a 20 percent decline in their cash flow from today’s levels, assuming the same cost and revenue model as today. One important driver of this profit pressure is the existence of strong competitive dynamics among companies that could shift market share from laggards to front-runners and might prompt debate about the unequal distribution of the benefits of AI (Exhibit 2).

2

How AI could affect workers

A widening gap might unfold at the level of individual workers (see video, “A minute with the McKinsey Global Institute: What AI can and can’t [yet] do”). Demand for jobs could shift away from repetitive tasks toward those that are socially and cognitively driven and require more digital skills. Job profiles characterized by repetitive activities or that require a low level of digital skills could experience the largest decline as a share of total employment to around 30 percent by 2030, from some 40 percent. The largest gain in share could be in nonrepetitive activities and those that require high digital skills, rising from roughly 40 percent to more than 50 percent.

Notes from the frontier: Modeling the impact of AI on the world economy

These shifts would have an impact on wages. We simulate that around 13 percent of the total wage bill could shift to categories requiring nonrepetitive and high digital skills, where incomes could rise, while workers in the repetitive and low-digital-skills categories could experience a stagnation or even a cut in their wages. The share of the total wage bill of the latter group could decline to 20 percent, from 33 percent.

A direct consequence of this widening gap in employment and wages would be an intensifying war for people, particularly those skilled in developing and using AI tools. On the other hand is the potential for structural excess supply for a still relatively high portion of people lacking the digital and cognitive skills necessary to work with machines.

Overall, the adoption and absorption of AI might not have a significant impact on net employment. There will likely be substantial pressure on full-time-employment demand, but the total net impact in aggregate might be more limited than many fear. Our average global scenario suggests that total full-time-equivalent-employment demand might remain flat, or even that there could be a slightly negative net impact on jobs by 2030.

The opportunity of AI is significant, but there is no doubt that its penetration might cause disruption. The productivity dividend of AI probably will not materialize immediately. Its impact is likely to build up at an accelerated pace over time; therefore, the benefits of initial investment might not be visible in the short term. Patience and long-term strategic thinking will be required.

Policy makers will need to show bold leadership to overcome understandable discomfort among citizens about the perceived threat to their jobs as automation takes hold. Companies will also be important actors in searching for solutions on the mammoth task of skilling and reskilling people to work with AI. Individuals will need to adjust to a new world in which job turnover could be more frequent, they might have to transition to new types of employment, and they likely must continually refresh and update their skills to match the needs of a dynamically changing job market.

Using historical trends of new jobs created to old jobs, and adjusting for a lower labor-output ratio that considers the likely labor-saving nature of AI technologies via smart automation, new jobs driven by investment in AI could augment employment by about 5 percent by 2030. The total productivity effect could have a positive contribution to employment of about 10 percent.","(0, 'GDP')"

The American economy was caught in transition on the eve of the Civil War. What had been an almost purely agricultural economy in 1800 was in the first stages of an industrial revolution which would result in the United States becoming one of the world's leading industrial powers by 1900. But the beginnings of the industrial revolution in the prewar years was almost exclusively limited to the regions north of the Mason-Dixon line, leaving much of the South far behind.



In 1860, the South was still predominantly agricultural, highly dependent upon the sale of staples to a world market. By 1815, cotton was the most valuable export in the United States; by 1840, it was worth more than all other exports combined. But while the southern states produced two-thirds of the world's supply of cotton, the South had little manufacturing capability, about 29 percent of the railroad tracks, and only 13 percent of the nation's banks. The South did experiment with using slave labor in manufacturing, but for the most part it was well satisfied with its agricultural economy.



The North, by contrast, was well on its way toward a commercial and manufacturing economy, which would have a direct impact on its war making ability. By 1860, 90 percent of the nation's manufacturing output came from northern states. The North produced 17 times more cotton and woolen textiles than the South, 30 times more leather goods, 20 times more pig iron, and 32 times more firearms. The North produced 3,200 firearms to every 100 produced in the South. Only about 40 percent of the Northern population was still engaged in agriculture by 1860, as compared to 84 percent of the South.



Even in the agricultural sector, Northern farmers were out-producing their southern counterparts in several important areas, as Southern agriculture remained labor intensive while northern agriculture became increasingly mechanized. By 1860, the free states had nearly twice the value of farm machinery per acre and per farm worker as did the slave states, leading to increased productivity. As a result, in 1860, the Northern states produced half of the nation's corn, four-fifths of its wheat, and seven-eighths of its oats.



The industrialization of the northern states had an impact upon urbanization and immigration. By 1860, 26 percent of the Northern population lived in urban areas, led by the remarkable growth of cities such as Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Detroit, with their farm-machinery, food-processing, machine-tool, and railroad equipment factories. Only about a tenth of the southern population lived in urban areas.



Free states attracted the vast majority of the waves of European immigration through the mid-19th century. Fully seven-eighths of foreign immigrants settled in free states. As a consequence, the population of the states that stayed in the Union was approximately 23 million as compared to a population of 9 million in the states of the Confederacy. This translated directly into the Union having 3.5 million males of military age - 18 to 45 - as compared to 1 million for the South. About 75 percent of Southern males fought the war, as compared to about half of Northern men.



The Southern lag in industrial development did not result from any inherent economic disadvantages. There was great wealth in the South, but it was primarily tied up in the slave economy. In 1860, the economic value of slaves in the United States exceeded the invested value of all of the nation's railroads, factories, and banks combined. On the eve of the Civil War, cotton prices were at an all-time high. The Confederate leaders were confident that the importance of cotton on the world market, particularly in England and France, would provide the South with the diplomatic and military assistance they needed for victory.



As both the North and the South mobilized for war, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the ""free market"" and the ""slave labor"" economic systems became increasingly clear - particularly in their ability to support and sustain a war economy. The Union's industrial and economic capacity soared during the war as the North continued its rapid industrialization to suppress the rebellion. In the South, a smaller industrial base, fewer rail lines, and an agricultural economy based upon slave labor made mobilization of resources more difficult. As the war dragged on, the Union's advantages in factories, railroads, and manpower put the Confederacy at a great disadvantage.



Nearly every sector of the Union economy witnessed increased production. Mechanization of farming allowed a single farmer growing crops such as corn or wheat to plant, harvest, and process much more than was possible when hand and animal power were the only available tools. (By 1860, a threshing machine could thresh 12 times as much grain per hour as could six men.) This mechanization became even more important as many farmers left home to enlist in the Union military. Those remaining behind could continue to manage the farm through the use of labor-saving devices like reapers and horse-drawn planters.



Northern transportation industries boomed during the conflict as well--particularly railroads. The North's larger number of tracks and better ability to construct and move parts gave it a distinct advantage over the South. Union forces moving south or west to fight often rode to battle on trains traveling on freshly lain tracks. In fact, as Northern forces traveled further south to fight and occupy the Confederacy, the War Department created the United States Military Railroads, designed to build rails to carry troops and supplies as well as operating captured Southern rail lines and equipment. By war's end, it was the world's largest railroad system.



Other Northern industries--weapons manufacturing, leather goods, iron production, textiles--grew and improved as the war progressed. The same was not true in the South. The twin disadvantages of a smaller industrial economy and having so much of the war fought in the South hampered Confederate growth and development. Southern farmers (including cotton growers) were hampered in their ability to sell their goods overseas due to Union naval blockades. Union invasions into the South resulted in the capture of Southern transportation and manufacturing facilities.



The Southern economy, while shaky throughout the war, grew markedly worse in its later years. The Emancipation Proclamation both enraged the South with its promise of freedom for their slaves, and threatened the very existence of its primary labor source. The economy continued to suffer during 1864 as Union armies battered Confederate troops in the eastern and western theaters. In the East, General Ulysses S. Grant threw men and materiel at Robert E. Lee's depleted and increasingly desperate army. Grant took advantage of railroad lines and new, improved steamships to move his soldiers and had a seemingly endless supply of troops, supplies, weapons, and materials to dedicate to crushing Lee's often ill-fed, ill-clad, and undermanned army. Though the campaign eventually fell into a stalemate at Petersburg, Virginia, Grant could afford to, as he stated, ""fight it out along this line if it takes all summer,"" while Lee could not.



In the western theater of the war, William T. Sherman's Union troops laid waste to much of the Georgia countryside during the Atlanta Campaign and the subsequent ""March to the Sea."" Sherman's campaigns inflicted massive damage to Southern industry, agriculture and infrastructure. His soldiers destroyed rail lines and captured the major economic and transportation hub of Atlanta and the critical seaport of Savannah. When Sherman famously telegraphed Lincoln in December 1864, ""I beg to present you as a Christmas gift the city of Savannah,"" his gift included ""about twenty-five thousand bales of cotton."" Sherman himself later estimated that this campaign, which eventually moved north and similarly impacted the Carolinas, caused $100 million of destruction. An already troubled Confederate economy simply could not absorb such massive losses and survive.



As the war progressed, substantial and far-reaching changes were taking place far from the battle lines. When Lincoln became president in March 1861, he faced a divided nation, but also a Congress dominated by Republicans after many Southern Democratic members left to join the Confederacy. Lincoln and congressional Republicans seized this opportunity to enact several pieces of legislation that had languished in Congress for years due to strong Southern opposition. Many of these bills set the course for the United States to emerge by war's end as a nation with enormous economic potential and poised for a massive and rapid westward expansion. When Southerners left Congress, the war actually provided the North with an opportunity southerners from Congress, the war actually provided the North with an opportunity to establish and dominate America's industrial and economic future.



Foremost among these bills was the Homestead Act, a popular measure regularly debated in Congress since the 1840s. This law provided free title to up to 160 acres of undeveloped federal land outside the 13 original colonies to anyone willing to live on and cultivate it. Southerners had for years opposed the idea because it would severely hamper any opportunity to expand slavery into the areas where settlement would be likely. In the North, ""free soilers"" had clamored for the bill for decades, while abolitionists viewed it as a means to populate the West with small farmers vehemently opposed to slavery's expansion. Abraham Lincoln publicly stated his support while president-elect, stating, ""In regards to the homestead bill, I am in favor of cutting the wild lands into parcels, so that every poor man may have a home."" He made good on his promise by signing the Homestead Act into law on May 20, 1862.



In order to make the farms more efficient and to help industries develop new and better equipment, as well as provide opportunities for students in the ""industrial classes,"" in 1862 Congress passed the Morrill Act (Land-Grant Colleges Act), by which each state was granted land for the purposes of endowing Agricultural and Mechanical (A and M) colleges. The purpose of the act was ""to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts."" This unprecedented national investment in higher education also required instruction in military tactics.



Another major initiative was the Pacific Railway Act, approved by President Lincoln on July 1, 1862. The transcontinental railroad linking the East and West had, like the homestead bill, been heavily debated by pre-war Congresses. Southerners wanted a railroad built along a southern route. Northerners, not surprisingly, wanted a Northern route. Once Southerners left Congress at the outset of the war, Republicans passed legislation that actually dictated a so-called ""middle route"" with an eastern terminus at Omaha and a western one at Sacramento. The construction of the first transcontinental railroad meant jobs for thousands in factories producing tracks and tools as well as those that labored for years to lay the tracks across rough terrain. It also meant the literal and symbolic linking of East and West (to the exclusion of the South) and decreased travel times for passengers and goods. It improved commercial opportunities, the construction of towns along both lines, a quicker route to markets for farm products, and other economic and industrial changes.



During the war, Congress also passed several major financial bills that forever altered the American monetary system. The Legal Tender Act authorized the federal government to print and use paper money, called ""greenbacks,"" to pay its bills and finance the war. Even though greenbacks were not backed by similar amounts of gold and silver, creditors were required to accept them at face value. By the end of the war, the government had printed over $500 million in greenbacks, and the American financial system's strict reliance on transactions in gold or silver ended. The National Bank Act created a national banking system to reduce the number of notes issued by individual banks and create a single federal currency. The Internal Revenue Act eased inflation primarily by placing excise taxes on many luxury items such as tobacco and jewelry. More famously, the first U.S. income tax was imposed in July 1861, at 3 percent of all incomes over $800 up to 10 percent for incomes over $100,000 to help pay for the war effort.



For better or worse, the political philosophies underlying the creation of the Confederate States of America, with its emphasis upon a strong state and a weak central government, coupled with its vast investments in a slave-labor-based agricultural economy, meant that the South had neither the ability nor the desire to develop the kind of industrial economy or centralized financial system required to sustain a ""modern"" war. By contrast, the Union's willingness and ability to vastly increase the influence and footprint of the federal government not only contributed directly to its military success in the war, but it also transformed many other areas of national life, including industrial, economic, agricultural, mechanical, and financial realms. Simply put, the United States of America would be a very different nation today than had the war never been fought. If we are truly the world's last remaining superpower, then it is, at least partially, the massive industrial and economic expansion enabled by the Civil War that allowed us to ascend to that role in the first place.

A year ago, economic activity was accelerating in almost all regions of the world. One year later, much has changed. The escalation of US–China trade tensions, needed credit tightening in China, macroeconomic stress in Argentina and Turkey, disruptions to the auto sector in Germany, and financial tightening alongside the normalization of monetary policy in the larger advanced economies have all contributed to a significantly weakened global expansion, especially in the second half of 2018.

With this weakness expected to persist into the first half of 2019, our new World Economic Outlook (WEO) projects a slowdown in growth in 2019 for 70 percent of the world economy. Global growth softened to 3.6 percent in 2018 and is projected to decline further to 3.3 percent in 2019. The downward revision in growth of 0.2 percentage points for 2019 from the January projection is also broad based. It reflects negative revisions for several major economies including the euro area, Latin America, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.

After the weak start, growth is projected to pick up in the second half of 2019. This pickup is supported by significant monetary policy accommodation by major economies, made possible by the absence of inflationary pressures despite growing at near potential. The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of England have all shifted to a more accommodative stance. China has ramped up its fiscal and monetary stimulus to counter the negative effect of trade tariffs. Furthermore, the outlook for US–China trade tensions has improved as the prospects of a trade agreement take shape.

After the weak start, growth is projected to pick up in the second half of 2019.

These policy responses have helped reverse the tightening of financial conditions to varying degrees across countries. Emerging markets have experienced some resumption in portfolio flows, a decline in sovereign borrowing costs, and a strengthening of their currencies relative to the US dollar. While the improvement in financial markets has been rapid, those in the real economy have been slow to materialize. Measures of industrial production and investment remain weak for now in many advanced and emerging market economies, and global trade has yet to recover.

With improved prospects for the second half of 2019, global growth in 2020 is projected to return to 3.6 percent. This recovery is precarious and predicated on a rebound in emerging market and developing economies, where growth is projected to increase from 4.4 percent in 2019 to 4.8 percent in 2020. Specifically, it relies on an expected rebound in growth in Argentina and Turkey and some improvement in a set of other stressed developing economies, and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Growth in advanced economies will slow slightly in 2020, despite a partial recovery in the euro area, as the impact of US fiscal stimulus fades and growth tends toward the modest potential for the group, given aging trends and low productivity growth.

Beyond 2020, global growth is expected to stabilize at around 3½ percent, bolstered mainly by growth in China and India and their increasing weights in world income. Growth in emerging market and developing economies will stabilize at 5 percent, though with considerable variance as emerging Asia continues to grow faster than other regions. A similar pattern holds for low-income countries with some, particularly commodity importers, growing rapidly but others falling further behind the advanced world in per capita terms.

Risks to global growth

While the global economy continues to grow at a reasonable rate and a global recession is not in the baseline projections, there are many downside risks. Tensions in trade policy could flare up again and play out in other areas (such as the auto industry), with large disruptions to global supply chains. Growth in systemic economies such as the euro area and China may surprise on the downside, and the risks surrounding Brexit remain heightened. A deterioration in market sentiment could rapidly tighten financing conditions in an environment of large private and public sector debt in many countries, including sovereign-bank doom loop risks.

Building more inclusive economies

Given these risks, it is imperative that costly policy mistakes are avoided. Policymakers need to work cooperatively to help ensure that policy uncertainty doesn’t weaken investment. Fiscal policy will need to manage trade-offs between supporting demand, protecting social spending, and ensuring that public debt remains on a sustainable path, with the optimal mix depending on country-specific circumstances. Financial sector policies must address vulnerabilities proactively by deploying macroprudential tools (such as counter-cyclical capital buffers)—a task made more urgent by the possibility that interest rates will remain low for longer. Monetary policy should remain data dependent, be well communicated, and ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored.

Across all economies, the imperative is to take actions that boost potential output, improve inclusiveness, and strengthen resilience. There is a need for greater multilateral cooperation to resolve trade conflicts, to address climate change and risks from cybersecurity, and to improve the effectiveness of international taxation.

This is a delicate moment for the global economy. If the downside risks do not materialize and the policy support put in place is effective, global growth should rebound. If, however, any of the major risks materialize, then the expected recoveries in stressed economies, export-dependent economies, and highly-indebted economies may be derailed. In that case, policymakers will need to adjust. Depending on circumstances, this may require synchronized though country-specific fiscal stimulus across economies, complemented by accommodative monetary policy. Lastly, adequate resources for multilateral institutions remain essential to retain an effective global safety net, which would help stabilize the global economy.","(0, 'GDP')"
270,The Decline in Manufacturing Jobs: Not Necessarily a Cause for Concern - International Monetary Fund,The Decline in Manufacturing Jobs: Not Necessarily a Cause for Concern  International Monetary Fund,"Mon, 09 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltZi5vcmcvZW4vQmxvZ3MvQXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAxOC8wNC8wOS90aGUtZGVjbGluZS1pbi1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLWpvYnMtbm90LW5lY2Vzc2FyaWx5LWEtY2F1c2UtZm9yLWNvbmNlcm7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,International Monetary Fund,"Manufacturing jobs are waning. In many emerging market and developing economies, workers are shifting from agriculture to services, bypassing the manufacturing sector. In advanced economies, the rise in service sector employment typically reflects the outright disappearance of manufacturing jobs.

The decline in manufacturing jobs is often met with anxiety. People are concerned that a smaller manufacturing sector implies slower economic growth and a scarcity of well-paying jobs for low- and middle-skilled workers—contributing to worsening inequality. In Chapter 3 of the April 2018 World Economic Outlook, we revisit the evidence supporting those beliefs and find that the declining share of manufacturing jobs need not hurt growth or raise inequality, provided the right policies are in place.

Shifts in economic activity and productivity

Shifts in economic activity are part of a natural process of “structural transformation.” As people get richer, they consume more services—such as health and financial services. Technological advances also lead to sizable labor savings, especially in manufacturing.

Our study provides novel evidence of how a stronger expansion of service rather than manufacturing jobs in emerging market and developing economies may affect their ability to catch up with advanced economy income levels. Using data for a large number of countries over the past five decades, we document that some service sectors are very similar to manufacturing in terms of levels, growth rates, and convergence of productivity (output per worker).

Some market service sectors—such as transport, telecommunications, and financial and business services—have higher levels and growth rates of output per worker than manufacturing. Moreover—just as in manufacturing—labor productivity in several service sectors tends to converge to the global frontier: that is, it grows faster where it is relatively low, allowing countries with low initial productivity levels to catch up toward those with higher levels.

As the highly-productive service sectors—such as communications, finance, and business activities—have been attracting workers faster than other sectors, the shift of employment from agriculture to services since the 2000s has benefited aggregate labor productivity in emerging market and developing countries across all regions—and especially in sub-Saharan Africa.

Of course, these findings should not lead policymakers into complacency. Barriers to international trade in services—which are much higher than for goods—should be reduced so that the expansion of highly-productive service sectors is not constrained by the growth of domestic demand. Policies should also ensure that workers’ skills are aligned with those needed in the more tradable service subsectors—such as financial and business services. And in many emerging market and developing countries where productivity remains anemic in all sectors, a comprehensive approach is needed to unlock productivity growth across the board, including by strengthening human capital and physical infrastructure, as well as improving the business and investment climate.

Shifts in economic activity and income inequality

Another frequently voiced concern is about the disappearance of high-quality manufacturing jobs in many advanced economies that are simply not available in the service sector. As factories close, many middle-skilled workers need to accept low-paying jobs in the service sector, contributing to the “hollowing out” of the income distribution, and a rise in inequality.

Our analysis shows that the level of labor income inequality within industry (70 percent of which is accounted by manufacturing) is indeed somewhat lower than within services in a sample of 20 advanced economies. But country characteristics are more important than the size of the industrial sector for explaining aggregate inequality. For example, inequality in Denmark is about one-third of that in the United States in both industry and services. And the biggest factor driving changes in aggregate inequality in advanced economies since the 1980s has been the increase in earning differences in all sectors—rather than the decline of industry jobs.

Still, the negative consequences of disappearing manufacturing jobs can be sizable for individual workers and their communities, especially in regions that developed as manufacturing hubs. To ensure inclusive gains from structural change, policies should facilitate the reskilling of displaced workers and reduce the costs of their reallocation. But policymakers should also be mindful that sectoral reallocation may be very costly or even unfeasible for some workers (such as those close to retirement age) and strengthen safety nets and targeted redistribution policies accordingly.

In sum, the decline of manufacturing as a source of employment need not hurt growth or raise inequality. But the key is to get the policies right.","(0, 'GDP')"

The arts and culture sector is often looked at through a very narrow lens. Theatre productions, museum exhibitions and symphony orchestras typically comprise the average person’s concept of the arts. What’s more, the arts are often viewed as isolated instead of being seen as part of a larger economic ecosystem.

But key decision-makers and leaders understand that the arts can be an important part of a city’s economic development and growth strategy — and this growth often comes without huge price tags or tax concessions.

As Lakewood, Colorado, Mayor Adam Paul once noted, “It was the vision of the neighbors and businesses along West Colfax [that created] an arts district tied to the history and culture of America’s longest main street. Now we have the flourishing 40 West Arts District, endorsed by the state and given the National Endowment for the Arts’ largest Our Town grant.” In the city of Lakewood, Mayor Paul has used the arts as a mechanism and stimulant for economic growth in his community. This has resulted in more businesses locating to the area, more foot traffic to local businesses, increased housing options, more jobs and higher tax revenues.

City leaders across the nation are seeking to revitalize and grow their cities into vibrant communities — and the arts are part of a larger set of tools to accomplish that goal. For example, many citizens — especially from younger generations — often place a premium on the ability to live and work in the same (walkable) area. As Mayor Carl Gerlach of Overland Park, Kansas, succinctly put it, “The young professional looking for a place to live wants a city with exciting development activity, increasing job opportunities and competitive pay, and a quality of place with a host of leisure time entertainment and activities.” A well-placed arts district, or the use of an arts venue as an anchor for a neighborhood, can be a magnet for economic growth.

The National League of Cities (NLC) just published its 2017 State of the Cities report, which analyzed mayoral State of the City addresses and catalogued the top issues discussed by mayors. The arts and culture were a major subtopic of economic development, the most widely-discussed issue.

While this isn’t surprising, what’s more interesting is the fact that the arts and culture plays a role in at least nine out of the 10 most widely-discussed topics. In other words, the arts are intertwined with nearly every major city issue. Here are a few examples:

Public Safety: Communities with arts and culture organizations are seen as safer by their residents; they bring residents closer together, and the arts act as a bridge between the community and police. Further, prison arts programs assist with recidivism rates and help children of incarcerated family members cope. In West Oakland, California, a mural program called the Community Rejuvenation Project (CRP) works with high school youth and provides a service called “abatement murals for businesses” that discourage graffiti and vandalism and provide inspirational images for the community.

Infrastructure: Areas that are well-lit and have public art or murals attract pedestrians, bicyclists and even auto traffic, which leads to safer and more vibrant communities.

Budgets: The arts and culture generate tax revenue far beyond any government investment, adding dollars to city coffers and helping city budgets. For example, the arts constitute a bigger share of America’s GDP than construction or agriculture. And on average, for every dollar invested into the nonprofit arts, six dollars in taxes are generated.

Housing: In order for a community to be vibrant, its residents need to be able to afford to live there. Many arts organizations and cities like New Orleans work to provide affordable housing to artists and their families.

Education: There is vast research which shows that a child with even minimal arts education performs better academically and socially than their peers.

Energy & Environment: The arts work to highlight topics like climate change, educating viewers about what can happen if we fail to change the way we use our natural resources and treat the Earth.

Health: Art therapy programs work across all health delivery platforms to provide effective health care services to both children and adults. The biggest area of research and programs is in the military, where art therapy serves to help veterans with PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).

Demographics: Mayors are concerned about diversity, immigration, and the quality of life of veterans and seniors. The arts work to unite people of different ages and from various ethnic and social backgrounds in common spaces that promote an increased understanding and acceptance of different cultures.

When city governments invest in arts and culture initiatives, city economies grow — but so do strong, vibrant communities. As Scottsdale, Arizona, Mayor Jim Lane notes, “Scottsdale is a city of the arts, and we should be very proud of that well-earned reputation. It’s good for our economy — and it’s good for our soul.”

Americans for the Arts has partnered with NLC for almost 20 years to educate and inform NLC members about the value of arts and culture and the economic power of the arts in cities. Its New Communities Visions Initiative highlights 30 city issues (outlined in the graphic below) in which the arts play an active role.

Featured image: Opened in September 2015, the Broad Museum in Los Angeles cemented the city’s downtown as the center of the L.A. arts scene and a full-on destination, boosting the local economy by attracting a vibrant mix of top-tier restaurants and bars, galleries and mixed-use housing and commercial properties.

272,China's Economic Outlook in Six Charts - International Monetary Fund,China's Economic Outlook in Six Charts  International Monetary Fund,"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltZi5vcmcvZW4vTmV3cy9BcnRpY2xlcy8yMDE4LzA3LzI1L25hMDcyNjE4LWNoaW5hcy1lY29ub21pYy1vdXRsb29rLWluLXNpeC1jaGFydHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,International Monetary Fund,"China’s Economic Outlook in Six Charts

China’s economy continues to perform strongly—with growth projected at 6.6 percent for 2018. Four decades of reform have transformed China from one of the poorest countries in the world to the second largest economy, said the IMF in its latest annual assessment of the economy.

Here are six charts you need to know about this report.

1. China’s strong GDP growth continues. The country now accounts for one-third of global growth. Over 800 million people have been lifted out of poverty and the country has achieved upper middle-income status. China’s per capita GDP continues to converge to that of the United States, albeit at a more moderate pace in the last few years.

2. A focus on high-quality growth. China is at an historic juncture. After decades of high-speed growth, the government is now focusing on high-quality growth. The authorities will need to build on the existing reform agenda and take advantage of the current growth momentum to “fix the roof while the sun is shining.” Key elements are: continuing to rein in credit growth, accelerating rebalancing efforts, increasing the role of market forces, fostering openness, and modernizing policy frameworks. Even with a gradual slowdown in growth, China could become the world’s largest economy by 2030.

3. Credit growth has slowed but remains too fast. Despite the sharp rebound in nominal GDP and industrial profits, total nonfinancial sector debt still rose significantly faster than nominal GDP growth in 2017. While the corporate debt to GDP ratio has stabilized, government and especially household debt is rising, driven by continued strong off-budget investment spending and a rapid increase in mortgage and consumer loans. It may take determined actions over an extended period of time to address underlying vulnerabilities.

4. China, a global digital leader. China has around 700 million internet users and 282 million digital natives (internet users less than 25 years old) eager to adopt new technology. The massive scale of the Chinese market and a supportive regulatory and supervisory environment in the early years of digitalization made China a global leader in frontier industries such as e-commerce and fintech. Digitalization will continue to reshape the Chinese economy by improving efficiency, softening—but not reversing—slowing growth as the economy matures.

5. Rebalancing efforts should be accelerated.

Increases in health, education, and social transfers—financed by taxes on income, property and carbon emissions—would support consumption, and reduce income inequality and pollution. A more comprehensive approach to structural reforms, such as increasing transfers to the regions most affected by overcapacity reduction or pollution control, could help address the tensions across rebalancing dimensions.

6. The benefits of faster reform. In the baseline, real GDP growth is projected at 6.6 in 2018, reflecting the lagged effect of regulatory tightening and softer external demand. Risks are tilted to the downside, with tightening global financial market conditions and rising trade tensions. If the authorities move more decisively to resolve the policy tensions now and focus on higher-quality growth and a greater role for the market, near-term growth would be weaker but longer-term growth would be stronger and more sustainable. An illustrative “proactive” scenario features faster reform progress, particularly state-owned enterprises (SOE) reform and resolving zombie firms, which also accelerates rebalancing from investment to consumption. If there is a risk of a too sharp slowdown, a temporary fiscal stimulus package with resources to support rebalancing could help cushion the near-term adverse impact.","(0, 'GDP')"
273,5. Views of the economy and the social safety net - Pew Research Center,5. Views of the economy and the social safety net  Pew Research Center,"Tue, 24 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBld3Jlc2VhcmNoLm9yZy9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDE3LzEwLzI0LzUtdmlld3Mtb2YtdGhlLWVjb25vbXktYW5kLXRoZS1zb2NpYWwtc2FmZXR5LW5ldC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Pew Research Center,"Views of the economy and social safety net reflect the distinct profiles of the typology groups. Opinions differ among those with similar partisan leanings while still following the traditional, wide divides between the left and right.

While most Americans and typology groups see economic inequality as a problem, Core Conservatives express relatively low levels of concern about this issue. And while most Republican-oriented groups think the economic system is generally fair to most Americans, a large majority of Market Skeptic Republicans say it unfairly favors powerful interests.

On the Democratic side, there is disagreement over whether hard work leads to success for most people. Solid Liberals are broadly skeptical, but a large share of Opportunity Democrats think most people can get ahead if they’re willing to work hard.

Views of the social safety net prompt traditional partisan responses. Republican-leaning groups say the government can’t afford to do much more to help the needy, while Democratic-leaning groups say the government should do more for the needy even if it means going deeper into debt.

And when it comes to two areas of current political debate, taxes and health care, the views of the typology groups are nuanced. There are wide differences between groups on the basis on partisan affiliation, but there also are gaps within the two broader party coalitions when it comes to the best way to address the two issues.

Evaluations of the U.S. economic system

Among the public overall, there are widespread doubts about the fairness of the country’s economic system. About two-thirds (65%) say the economic system in this country unfairly favors powerful interests, while just 32% say the economic system is general fair to most Americans.

Democratic-oriented typology groups are especially likely to view the economic system as unfair. Fully 99% of Solid Liberals and Disaffected Democrats say the country’s economic system unfairly favors powerful interests. Two-thirds of Opportunity Democrats (67%) say this, as do a somewhat smaller majority (55%) of Devout and Diverse.

On the Republican side, 94% of Market Skeptic Republicans say the economic system unfairly favors the powerful. By contrast, most other Republican-oriented groups think the economic system in the country is generally fair to most people.

When asked about the issue of economic inequality, most Americans (82%) say it is either a very big problem (48%) or a moderately big problem (34%) in the country today. Relatively few say it is a small problem or not a problem at all.

There is disagreement among Republican-leaning typology groups in concerns about economic inequality. Just 8% of Core Conservatives think economic inequality is a very big problem, while another 37% think it is a moderately big problem. Clear majorities of all other Republican-leaning groups say economic inequality is at least a moderately big problem, including 86% of Market Skeptic Republicans.

Broad majorities of Democratic-oriented groups say economic inequality is a moderately big or very big problem. All Solid Liberals say inequality is at least a moderately big problem, including 84% who say it is a very big problem. Among Disaffected Democrats, far more also view economic inequality as a very big (66%) than moderately big (30%) problem.

Views of hard work and success

Despite widespread sentiment that the economic system is unfair, most Americans continue to believe in the ability of people to get

ahead through hard work. About six-in-ten (61%) say most people who want to get ahead can make it if they’re willing to work hard; fewer (36%) say that hard work and determination are no guarantee of success for most people.

On the left, Opportunity Democrats and Solid Liberals take very different views of whether success is possible through hard work. By 76% to 22%, Opportunity Democrats say that most people can get ahead if they are willing to work hard. This viewpoint sets them apart from the other Democratic groups.

A wide majority of Solid Liberals (73%) think hard work and determination are no guarantee of success for most people. Devout and Diverse and Disaffected Democrats, both financially strapped groups, are roughly divided in their views on hard work and success.

Roughly nine-in-ten Core Conservatives (94%) and New Era Enterprisers (90%) think most people can get ahead if they’re willing to work hard. Smaller majorities of Market Skeptic Republicans (65%) and Country First Conservatives (57%) say the same.

Divided views on the social safety net

Views on the social safety net follow a liberal-conservative pattern across the typology groups, with a wide gulf between the views of Core Conservative and Solid Liberals.

Overall, 85% of Solid Liberals say the government “should do more to help needy Americans, even if it means going deeper into debt.” Most Disaffected Democrats (72%), Opportunity Democrats (62%) and Devout and Diverse (62%) share this view.

Republican-oriented typology groups take the opposite view: 83% of Core Conservatives and 70% of Country First Conservatives say the government cannot afford to do much more to help the needy. Smaller majorities of Market Skeptic Republicans (58%) and New Era Enterprisers (59%) say the same.

Views on ‘zero-sum’ economic policies

Although the public has concerns about economic fairness and issues such as inequality, a narrow majority believes that it’s possible to have economic policies that benefit all Americans. Overall, 56% say “it’s possible to have economic policies that benefit everyone in the country,” while fewer (41%) think “pretty much any economic policy will end up benefiting some people at the expense of others.”

Across most typology groups, greater shares believe there are economic policies that can benefit all than say any policy will benefit some at the expense of others. And there’s rare agreement between Core Conservatives and Solid Liberals on this question: About six-in-ten among both groups say there are economic policies that can benefit everyone in the country.

Market Skeptic Republicans stand out from all other groups in their views. A majority (58%) says that pretty much any economic policy will end up benefiting some at the expense of others, compared with 41% who say it’s possible to have policies that benefit all. Along with their opinions on business and other economic issues, Market Skeptic Republicans’ view that economic policies are inherently unfair distinguish them from other Republican-oriented groups.

Divisions across typology groups in views of health care

Core Conservatives and Solid Liberals are poles apart on the question of the government’s role in health care, but this hot-button political issue also surfaces differences among the Republican-oriented groups. And while majorities of all Democratic-oriented groups think the government should make sure all Americans have health coverage, there are differences over whether the country should institute a “single-payer” system.

An overwhelming share of Core Conservatives (88%) say it is not the government’s responsibility to make sure all Americans have health care coverage. Most Country First Conservatives (72%) also take this position. A narrower 57% majority of Market Skeptic Republicans say it’s not the government’s responsibility to make sure all Americans have health care coverage. However, among the Republican-leaning New Era Enterprisers, about as many say it is not the government’s responsibility to ensure Americans have health care (50%) as say it is (47%).

Among the Democratic-oriented groups, about seven-in-ten or more say it is the government’s responsibility to make sure all Americans have health care coverage. But there are differences in views about the right approach for ensuring coverage.

Overall, 70% of Solid Liberals say it’s the government’s responsibility to make sure all Americans have health care coverage and that coverage should be provided through a single national health insurance system run by the government; fewer (24%) say government should ensure that all have health care, but that coverage should continue to be provided through a mix of private insurance companies and government programs.

By comparison, Opportunity Democrats are only somewhat more likely to support single payer over a mix of public and private programs (44% vs. 33%). Disaffected Democrats and Devout and Diverse say it’s the government’s responsibility to make sure all Americans have health care, but they are about evenly divided over the best approach for providing coverage.

Views on tax policy

A 43% plurality of the public says tax rates on household income over $250,000 should be raised. About a quarter (24%) say tax rates on this income should be lowered, while 29% say these rates on household income over $250,000 should be kept the same as they are now.

Views on taxes for large businesses and corporations are roughly similar to those on higher-income rates: 52% think tax rates on large businesses and corporations should be raised, while 24% think they should be lowered and 21% say they should stay the same.

Core Conservatives are more likely than all other groups to say there should be lower taxes on both on large businesses and corporations (67%) and household income over $250,000 (51%).

Market Skeptic Republicans, who widely say the economic system unfairly favors powerful interests, differ with the other right-leaning groups on tax policy. More say tax rates on high-earning households should be raised (40%) than say they should be kept the same (32%) or lowered (24%). And a 55% majority of Market Skeptic Republicans also says taxes on large businesses and corporations should be raised. Country First Conservatives and New Era Enterprisers are largely split in their views on tax rates for corporations and higher incomes, with fewer than 40% advocating any single approach to either question.

Large majorities of Solid Liberals think taxes should be raised on businesses and corporations (79%) as well as on household incomes over $250,000 (75%).

Among Devout and Diverse, Disaffected Democrats and Opportunity Democrats, greater shares say taxes should be raised than lowered on businesses and corporations as well as on household incomes over $250,000. However, slightly larger shares of all three groups support higher tax rates on large businesses and corporations than on household incomes over $250,000.

Most prioritize worker training in efforts to improve job situation

Wide majorities say the better way to improve the job situation in this country is “working to train people in the skills needed for jobs that are in demand” (81%) rather than “working to bring back or save the kinds of jobs that match the skills people already have” (16%).

The typology groups are largely in agreement on the better approach to improve the job situation. For example, large shares of Solid Liberals (95%) and Core Conservatives (80%) say the better way is to work to train people for in-demand jobs.

Country First Conservatives are the least likely to say this, though a majority still do: 62% say the better option is to train for in-demand jobs, while 30% say it’s better to work to bring back jobs that match current skills in the workforce.","(4, 'national debt')"

CID Working Paper No. 321

Stuart Russell, Douglas Barrios and Matt Andrews

July 2016

Introduction

Data on the sports economy is often difficult to interpret, far from transparent, or simply unavailable. Data fraught with weaknesses causes observers of the sports economy to account for the sector differently, rendering their analyses difficult to compare or causing them to simply disagree. Such disagreement means that claims regarding the economic spillovers of the industry can be easily manipulated or exaggerated. Thoroughly accounting for the industry is therefore an important initial step in assessing the economic importance of sports-related activities. For instance, what do policymakers mean when they discuss sports-related economic activities? What activities are considered part of the ""sports economy?"" What are the difficulties associated with accounting for these activities? Answering these basic questions allows governments to improve their policies.

The paper below assesses existing attempts to understand the sports economy and proposes a more nuanced way to consider the industry. Section 1 provides a brief overview of existing accounts of the sports economy. We first differentiate between three types of assessments: market research accounts conducted by consulting groups, academic accounts written by scholars, and structural accounts initiated primarily by national statistical agencies. We then discuss the European Union’s (EU) recent work to better account for and understand the sports economy. Section 2 describes the challenges constraining existing accounts of the sports economy. We describe two major constraints - measurement challenges and definition challenges - and highlight how the EU's work has attempted to address them. We conclude that, although the Vilnius Definition improves upon previous accounts, it still features areas for improvement.

Section 3 therefore proposes a paradigm shift with respect to how we understand the sports economy. Instead of primarily inquiring about the size of the sports economy, the approach recognizes the diversity of sports-related economic activities and of relevant dimensions of analysis. It therefore warns against attempts at aggregation before there are better data and more widely agreed upon definitions of the sports economy. It asks the following questions: How different are sports-related sectors? Are fitness facilities, for instance, comparable to professional sports clubs in terms of their production scheme and type of employment? Should they be understood together or treated separately? We briefly explore difference in sports-related industry classifications using data from the Netherlands, Mexico, and the United States. Finally, in a short conclusion, we discuss how these differences could be more fully explored in the future, especially if improvements are made with respect to data disaggregation and standardization.

Academic research does not provide much support for this claim. The evidence suggests that when immigration increases the supply of labor, firms increase investment to offset any reduction in capital per worker, thereby keeping average wages from falling over the long term. Moreover, immigrants are often imperfect substitutes for native-born workers in U.S. labor markets. That means they do not compete for the same jobs and put minimal downward pressure on natives’ wages. This might explain why competition from new immigrants has mostly affected earlier immigrants, who experienced significant reductions in wages from the surge in immigration. In contrast, studies find that immigration has actually raised average wages of native-born workers during the last few decades.

Immigrants are at the forefront of innovation and ingenuity in the United States, accounting for a disproportionately high share of patent filings, science and technology graduates, and senior positions at top venture capital-funded firms. In addition, the presence of immigrants often creates opportunities for less-skilled native workers to become more specialized in their work, thereby increasing their productivity.

Immigration generally also improves the government’s fiscal situation, as many immigrants pay more in taxes over a lifetime than they consume in government services. However, native-born residents of states with large concentrations of less-educated immigrants may face larger tax burdens, as these immigrants pay less in taxes and are more likely to send children to public schools.

Labor Market Competition

A popular view is that immigrants are taking jobs from American citizens. However, although immigrants increase the supply of labor, they also spend their wages on homes, food, TVs and other goods and services and expand domestic economic demand. This increased demand, in turn, generates more jobs to build those homes, make and sell food, and transport TVs.

Most empirical studies indicate long-term benefits for natives’ employment and wages from immigration, although some studies suggest that these gains come at the cost of short-term losses from lower wages and higher unemployment.1 Standard economic theory implies that while higher labor supply from immigration may initially depress wages, over time firms increase investment to restore the amount of capital per worker, which then restores wages. Steady growth in the capital-labor ratio prevents workers’ average productivity, and therefore their average wages from declining over the long run. Figure 2 shows the pre-1980 trend in the capital-labor ratio extrapolated over the next few decades – the period when U.S. immigration accelerated. Consistent with the theory, the actual capital-labor ratio did not significantly or permanently deviate from that trend after 1980.2","(1, 'employment/wages')"

The US has the world’s single largest economy, accounting for almost a quarter of global GDP (at market exchange rates), one-fifth of global FDI, and more than a third of stock market capitalisation. It is the most important export destination for one-fifth of countries around the world. The US dollar is the most widely used currency in global trade and financial transactions, and changes in US monetary policy and investor sentiment play a major role in driving global financing conditions (World Bank 2016).

At the same time, the global economy is important for the US as well. Affiliates of US multinationals operating abroad, and affiliates of foreign companies located in the US account for a large share of US output, employment, cross-border trade and financial flows, and stock market capitalisation. Recent studies have examined the importance of global growth for the US economy (Shambaugh 2016), the global impact of changes in US monetary policy (Rey 2013), or the global effect of changing US trade policies (Furman et al. 2017, Crowley et al. 2017).

It is likely that there will be shifts in US growth, monetary and fiscal policies, as well as uncertainty in US financial markets. What will be the global spillovers? Our recent work (Kose et al. 2017) attempts to answer these questions:

How synchronised are US and global business cycles?

How large are global spillovers from US growth and policy shocks?

How important is the global economy for the US?

How synchronised are US and global business cycles?

Business cycles in the US, other advanced economies (AEs), and emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) have been highly synchronous (Figure 1.A). This partly reflects the strength of global trade and financial linkages of the US economy with the rest of the world, but also that global shocks drive common cyclical fluctuations. This was particularly the case at the time of the 2008-09 Global Crisis. It is not a new phenomenon, however. Although the four recessions the global economy experienced since 1960 (1975, 1982, 1991, and 2009) were driven by many problems in many places, they all overlapped with severe recessions in the US (Kose and Terrones 2015).

Other countries tend to be in the same business cycle phase as the US roughly 80% of the time (Figure 1.B). The degree of synchronisation with US financial cycles is slightly lower, but still significant – credit, housing, and equity price cycles are in the same phase about 60% of the time. Although it is difficult to establish empirically whether the US economy leads business and financial cycle turning points in other economies, recent research indicates that the US appears to influence the timing and duration of recessions in many major economies (Francis et al. 2015).

Notes: Average share of years in which business cycles in the US and all economies were in the same phase. A higher share suggests more synchronization between two countries.

How large are global spillovers from US growth and policy shocks?

A surge in US growth – whether due to expansionary fiscal policies or other reasons – could provide a significant boost to the global economy. Shocks to the US economy transmit to the rest of the world through three main channels.

An acceleration in US activity can lift growth in trading partners directly through an increase in import demand, and indirectly by strengthening productivity spillovers embedded in trade. Financial market developments in the US may have even wider global implications. US bond and equity markets are the largest and most liquid in the world and the US dollar is the currency mostly widely used in trade and financial transactions. This makes US monetary policy and investor confidence important drivers of global financial conditions (Arteta et al. 2015, IMF2015). Given its role in global commodity markets (the US is both the world’s largest gas and oil consumer and producer), changes in US growth prospects can affect global commodity prices. This affects activity, fiscal and balance of payment developments in commodity exporters.

Estimates indicate that a percentage-point increase in US growth could boost growth in advanced economies by 0.8 of a percentage point, and in emerging market and developing economies by 0.6 of a percentage point after one year (Figure 2.A). Investment could respond even more strongly. A boost to investment could come for instance from fiscal stimulus measures – but the effect would largely depend on the circumstances of the implementation of these measures, including the amount of remaining economic slack, the response of monetary policy, and the adjustment of household and business expectations to the prospect of higher deficit and debt levels. A faster tightening of US monetary policy than previously expected could, for instance, lead to sudden increases in borrowing costs, currency pressures, financial market volatility, and capital outflows for more vulnerable emerging market and developing economies.

Even in the absence of actual policy changes, heightened uncertainty driven by financial market volatility or ambiguity about the direction and scope of US policies could discourage investment both in the US and in the rest of the world. Empirical estimates suggest that a sustained 10% increase in US stock market volatility (specifically, the VIX) could, after one year, reduce investment growth in the US by about 0.6 of a percentage point, in other advanced economies by around 0.5 of a percentage point, and in emerging market and developing economies by 0.6 of a percentage point (Figure 2.B).

How important is the global economy for the US?

Important as the US is to the global economy, the US economy is also affected by its trade and financial linkages with the rest of the world. Global economic developments play an important role in driving activity and financial markets in the US.

US multinationals account for a large share of US output and labour productivity growth, and their presence in financial markets is large. In turn, foreign multinationals operating in the US provide a large share of US employment and exports (Figure 3.A).

Much of the global value chain activity is conducted through US multinational corporations and their affiliates abroad. Overall, one-quarter of US exports represents US value added embedded in other countries' exports. This ‘forward participation’ is particularly high in chemicals, business services, and electronics, and with China, Canada, and Mexico. ‘Backward participation’ is more limited: the average import content of US exports was 13% in 2014, well below the average for other advanced economies (27%). This interconnectedness is an important source of spillovers between the US and the global economy.

As a result, growth setbacks originating in other economies, or policy changes affecting market access of US companies, can have detrimental effects on the US. These effects are particularly noticeable in the more globally integrated manufacturing sector (Figure 3.B).

Acceleration or uncertainty?

Given its size and the strength of its ties with the global economy, shocks to the US economy are transmitted globally through many channels. On the one hand, an acceleration in US growth could be expected to have positive effects for the rest of the world, if not counterbalanced by increased trade barriers or an unexpected tightening of global financing conditions. On the other hand, persistent policy uncertainty could hamper growth throughout the global economy, and could have particularly adverse effects on investment growth in emerging market and developing economies, which have already showed weakness in recent years (World Bank 2017).

18 July 2018

Economic slack is a phrase used to describe the amount of resources in the economy that are not used. Machines left idle in a factory or people who cannot find a job represent slack to an economist.

The reason that slack exists is usually due to insufficient demand relative to what the economy is capable of producing. This is why economists want to keep track of it as it can give important signals about what is happening in the economy.

Why do central banks monitor slack?

If there is a large amount of slack in the economy it tends to mean many people are looking for a job. Even if the economy starts growing, there is still little pressure on producers at that stage to raise wages. This in turn means that they do not need to raise the prices of their products to cover higher wage costs. As a result, there is no danger of inflation getting out of control, so for the central bank it might mean that it can keep interest rates unchanged. The central bank may even consider providing stimulus to the economy, for example by cutting interest rates or using non-standard measures, to prevent inflation from falling too low for too long or even deflation kicking in.

After a while, however, as employment picks up and companies produce more, slack starts to disappear. The economy is about to hit its full capacity. It becomes difficult to find new employees and producers need to raise wages in order to keep existing ones. As a result, sharper price increases can be expected. For the central bank, this means that it is probably time to raise interest rates to keep prices stable.

The amount of slack therefore provides information about current and future inflationary pressures in the economy. It is one of the factors that can help the central bank make monetary policy decisions – when to raise or cut interest rates. The timing of such a policy move is crucial. Raising interest rates too early could hurt an economic recovery but doing so too late could result in higher inflation.

How is economic slack measured?

There are significant challenges in measuring slack, which is one reason why the concept is often discussed in economic debates. To measure it, economists often use the output gap, which is the difference between what is actually being produced in an economy (actual output) and what it has the capacity to produce (potential output). Actual output is measured by gross domestic product. Potential output is a concept that refers to the amount of goods and services that an economy is capable of producing when its resources, such as the workforce, equipment, infrastructure, and technology, are used in an efficient way that can be sustained over time.

Actual output can be lower or higher than potential output. If it is lower, economists talk about a negative output gap. This happens when there is spare capacity, or slack, in the economy. If the actual output is higher than the potential output, economists talk about a positive output gap. This happens when demand is very high and the economy is operating above what it can sustainably maintain.

Being a theoretical concept, potential output cannot be measured directly and experts use different methodologies to estimate it. Consequently, they get different results. To make matters even more tricky, estimates of potential output are often the most uncertain for the period that interests central bankers the most: the recent past and present. As a result, slack and the output gap are rarely out of economic debates.","(0, 'GDP')"

For a company that brings crafted items to the world via the internet and roughly 1.7 million sellers and 27.1 million buyers, that model of difference has been evident since day one. As Etsy has expanded and become publicly traded, its initial dedication to craftsmanship and value has remained the thread through everything. “We really want to be a model for a profitable company that is values-driven.”

The Etsy online marketplace, as it’s known, connects sellers of all things artisanal to buyers worldwide. One might scour the site for the latest in hand-knit blankets, Halloween pet costumes, mid-century modern furniture, or wedding accessories, from an individual or small business owner — and then ask questions about how it was made. The site has enabled the handcrafted world of the maker to be reached by millions; its annual gross merchandise sales hover well over $2 billion.

True to its craftsman form, Etsy got its start in Brooklyn —a longtime maker hub — back in 2005. In mid-2016, it moved into its new headquarters at 117 Adams in DUMBO, amid Brooklyn’s growing Tech Triangle, which houses digital companies like MakerBot and Huge. “New York City is increasingly being seen as a tech hub,” says Jassy, who also oversaw the 2011 opening of Etsy’s Hudson office — a site dedicated to customer support for the company’s sizable community. “We wanted to build a whole [office] culture” around helping marketplace members, she says of the decision to house part of its operations upstate, just a short train ride from the NYC headquarters.

In April of 2015, Etsy went public as a certified B Corporation, a designation through the nonprofit B Lab, which promotes “people using business as a force for good™.” Etsy strives to encompass that model through treating employees well, implementing strong sustainable business practices, and being a positive force in the world. It now has 10 offices worldwide and hundreds of employees across cities including Berlin, London, Tokyo and Dublin.

Among Etsy’s notable initiatives is the Craft Entrepreneurship program, which encourages entrepreneurship in regions that need help building a stronger economy. “Teachers” — more experienced Etsy sellers — help individuals in underserved communities gain the skills to get products off the ground. Participating cities include Rockford, Ill. and Hazard, Ky.

In 2015, Etsy introduced Etsy Manufacturing, which pairs sellers in its communities with possible manufacturers to help foster additional partnerships among small businesses. As Etsy enters its second decade, it’s leading a new idea of commerce via the web, so that individuals and small businesses can support themselves, while Etsy works toward implementing its values-driven model across the world.

Championing the local in New York State



“We think that DUMBO reflects so many of the things that we cherish at Etsy — it’s filled with the kind of people that comprise our global marketplace: artists, makers, startups, small businesses,” Jassy says of Etsy’s commitment to New York State, explaining that even the aesthetic of “old factories and warehouses” in both DUMBO and Hudson, “provides an ideal space for our team.”

The Etsy Hudson annex may be filled with screens and support calls routed from all over the world, but it’s also located in a brick warehouse from the 1800s that was once the Traver & Sons’ mill. A former whaling town, Hudson was the center of the famed Hudson River School of mid-19th century painters. Today, it boasts a bevy of galleries, shops, and award-winning restaurants. Hudson has among the highest rates of self-employment in the state — an excellent match for Etsy’s focus on small-business success. It’s a place known for its local businesses and excellent quality of life, and Etsy is proud to have become a major employer for the area.

Etsy's decision to expand its workforce in DUMBO and Hudson was reinforced by state tax-based incentives that support job creation and growth in fields like biotech, tech, and green technology. As regions across New York become home to creative tech companies, and schools like Columbia, CUNY City College, and NYU — all of which Etsy works with — expand their work geared toward tech and design, the moment to be in tech in New York has arrived.

Jassy says that the company diligently focuses on areas including diversity; it also fosters a culture of giving for employees and organizations. On the company’s anniversary each year, Etsy employees are given the day to volunteer. They’re also provided 40 hours of paid time to perform volunteer work annually, while Etsy itself partners with dozens of local organizations and schools.

Etsy also looks closely at its diversity efforts in fields across the company, including engineering — an area that has suffered from a lack of diversity at many companies. To foster a more diverse tech world, Etsy pledges needs-based grants to The Recurse Center — an educational retreat that enables people to get better at programming — and works with Lesbians Who Tech, and the National Center for Women & Information Technology. It also partners with Jopwell, which promotes hiring for underrepresented minorities, and Digital Undivided, which fosters a network for women of color entrepreneurs.

Crafting a better globe



Today, in keeping with its mission, Etsy is focusing on “being thoughtful consumers,” across the board Jassy says, explaining that same careful approach they apply toward craftsmanship “is very tied to sustainability.” 117 Adams is participating in the Living Building Challenge℠, which calls for the highest and most rigorous demonstration of sustainability across areas like energy use and chemical products used.

Both offices source much of their furniture from local makers, and power their buildings in part through the energy generated from solar panels on their roofs. The company’s global HQ in DUMBO is also looking into nearby solar sources so it can fulfill its aim of transitioning to renewable electricity by 2020. Inside the offices, local food is also a part of the mission through Etsy, a twice-weekly lunch program coordinated to bring in local products to each office worldwide so that employees can get to know the source of their food. Even Etsy’s in-house snacks come from local vendors.

To support its employees holistically, in 2016 Etsy instituted a gender-blind parental leave policy that provides a full 26 weeks off after the birth or adoption of a child, and can be used across the first two years of childhood. Etsy’s Code as Craft blog — instituted by its CEO Chad Dickerson — looks not only at its technical work, but also social issues of inclusion, diversity throughout office culture, and collaboration.

As Etsy grows, it hopes to develop an operational plan around its values so that other businesses inspired by its mission can adopt a similar model. “We build for the long-term,” Jassy explains, referring to the company’s commitment to both its New York centers, and its global communities.

The company’s success is, ultimately, tied to the success of its sellers — something Jassy thinks distinguishes Etsy’s culture, and has made it suited to its Brooklyn and Hudson locations. Like its maker products and so much of its experience growing from its Brooklyn founding, Etsy’s values are homespun for global reach. That small-product-with-big-reach model is one it intends to share with the world.

PlanCOS Vision

Fosters an environment of inclusivity and economic diversity by attracting an innovative and adaptive workforce, advancing existing and targeted industry clusters, investing in quality of life, supporting our military, and expanding our sports ecosystem as Olympic City USA.

Key Strategies

Nurture cornerstone institutions, target industries, spinoffs, startups, and entrepreneurship

Expand high-quality infrastructure and technology

Create amenities to attract new business and residents

Importance of the Economy

Our vision for physical development will not be fully realized unless we have a strong local economy. A thriving economy is needed in order to accomplish our ambitious goals, and to maintain our competitive edge. Strategic attention to our physical development is essential to attracting and maintaining the employees, jobs, and investment we need for a healthy economy. In turn, continued land use investment provides the public revenues needed to support the facilities and services necessary to create and maintain our great places. Great places attract a high-quality work force and investment in the community.

Although the attraction and retention of well-paying and sustainable jobs is the essential and foundational lynchpin for a thriving economy, this Plan also recognizes that relatively lower-paying jobs will be associated with and support this base. Therefore, a city and economy that thrives overall, needs to have places, housing, transportation, and services that meet the needs of citizens across our economic spectrum. PlanCOS recognizes the importance of taking care of, growing, and adapting our traditional and anchoring economic bases starting with our military, and all of its related sectors, including technology and cybersecurity. At the same time, our Plan reflects the importance of never being complacent, especially when it comes to our part in creating a business climate that supports economic diversification, innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic inclusion. A thriving economy is one that offers diverse and well-paying jobs, along with a strong educational and workforce training system that effectively prepares our residents for these opportunities. As a city, we recognize our important role in assuring that basic infrastructure and services are provided to support a healthy economy. For people of all ages, high quality, adaptive, and accessible education will also be essential for developing and maintaining our adaptive and competitive workforce. Therefore, we need to partner with and support our educational providers.","(2, 'housing')"

He introduced the Climate Risk Disclosure Act and the Addressing Climate Financial Risk Act to safeguard our economy from the financial risks posed by the climate crisis. In addition, he created the Congressional Sustainable Investment Caucus to bring together Members of Congress with experts to better understand sustainable investing and inform policymaking that provides investor protections and transparency of information to market participants.

After Rep. Casten introduced the Climate Risk Disclosure Act, the SEC underwent a rigorous process to develop and finalize a strong and durable climate disclosure rule. Thanks to Rep. Casten's work, investors will have access to clear, comparable, standardized disclosures to judge registrants' climate risks.","(1, 'employment/wages')"

A constant in the history of economics is that countries encounter recessions. Since World War II, the U.S. economy has been in a recession for about one of every seven months and for at least one month in roughly one-third of the years over that period. Recessions have many causes—financial markets crashing, monetary policy tightening, consumers cutting spending, firms lowering investment, oil prices shifting—but at some point, economic expansions end and the economy begins to contract.

This volume lays out a set of changes to fiscal programs to improve the policy response to a recession in the United States. It starts from three main premises, which are described in more detail in the following chapter:

First, recessions are costly. Individuals lose jobs and income. The economy wastes resources and can sometimes even face a permanently lower output path. Second, fiscal policy is an effective aspect of the government’s part of a response to a recession. Expansionary fiscal policy can increase output; it can increase the utilization of resources; and in particular, when monetary policy has reduced interest rates to zero, it can meaningfully shift the economy’s trajectory upwards. Third, increasing the automatic nature of fiscal policy would be helpful. Increasing spending quickly could lead to a shallower and shorter recession.

Using evidence-based automatic “triggers” to alter the course of spending would be a more-effective way to deliver stimulus to the economy than waiting for policymakers to act. Such well-crafted automatic stabilizers are the best way to deliver fiscal stimulus in a timely, targeted, and temporary way. There will likely still be a need for discretionary policy; but by automating certain parts of the response, the United States can improve its macroeconomic outcomes.

The first chapter lays out the case for automatic stabilizers in detail. An important point is that we have sufficient data to discern when a recession is starting in real time, which is a solid foundation for implementing automatic stabilizers. Some stabilizers respond as underlying fundamentals shift—for example, regular unemployment insurance spending rises as more workers lose their jobs, so policymakers do not need to switch on this policy. But one can also tell when a recession is unfolding and more-robust measures are necessary—such as extended unemployment benefits. The policy rule articulated by Claudia Sahm in this volume would generally go into effect within a few months of the start of a recession. A rule like this is both quite timely and far more effective at signaling recessions than other metrics. In a subsequent chapter, Matt Fiedler, Jason Furman, and Wilson Powell III suggest triggers that could be used at the state level as well.

Although automatic stabilizers do exist, they are relatively small in the United States compared with those in other countries. At the same time, there have been frequent discretionary policy changes made in the face of economic downturns to push more money into the economy via tax cuts, direct payments, or increased spending. In the second chapter of this volume, Louise Sheiner and Michael Ng highlight the extent of the U.S. budget’s cyclicality over time. Whereas federal taxes provide a substantial amount of automatic stabilization—and discretionary federal policy is also strongly countercyclical—state and local fiscal policy is slightly procyclical.

The remaining six chapters of the book make concrete proposals for adjusting U.S. fiscal policy to expand the implementation of automatic stabilizers and make them more effective. The first two proposals entail creating new policies that are based on evidence from discretionary policies used in prior recessions. Both aim to avoid damaging contractionary responses to recessions, first on the part of households, and second on the part of state governments.

In the third chapter, Claudia Sahm suggests making an automatic direct payment to qualified households during economic downturns. Such payments have been used before in a variety of ways, through either temporary tax cuts or direct payments, but not in an automated fashion. Sahm demonstrates the effectiveness of such programs and shows how an automated set of payments could have been made earlier and more predictably than discretionary payments in the past. Given the large share of consumption in the U.S. economy and the propensity for consumption to fall during a recession, such a policy could be an important way to combat any sizable fall in demand in the economy.

In the fourth chapter, Matt Fiedler, Jason Furman, and Wilson Powell III suggest a way to provide funds to states to avoid sharp, procyclical cutbacks at the state and local levels. During a recession, the federal government is in principle able to counteract declines in economic activity by increasing spending, even while revenues decline—making up the difference with additional borrowing. However, a large portion of U.S. public spending occurs at the state and local levels, where borrowing is much more difficult and declines in tax revenues generally lead to declines in spending. Fiedler, Furman, and Powell address this concern in the context of Federal Medical Assistance Percentage formula funds, which were adjusted during the Great Recession and could be automatically adjusted to provide state-level fiscal support during future recessions.

There are also several current programs that could be adjusted to improve their effectiveness as automatic stabilizers. In the fifth chapter, Andrew Haughwout proposes setting up and maintaining a list of potential transportation infrastructure projects whose funding could be ramped up during downturns. Though Congress has often used transportation infrastructure as a method to generate spending during a downturn, this process could instead be automated by changing the spending rules for the BUILD program (formerly the TIGER grant program) so that the federal government would fund more projects during downturns and fewer during a boom. Because BUILD is constantly awarding funds, states would have projects ready to be funded and would be familiar with the funding stream, allowing for timely spending.

The programs that make up the social safety net constitute an important set of automatic stabilizers in the current U.S. policy mix. Because these programs provide resources to people with little or no income, the need for the benefits they provide rises along with the unemployment rate. As currently implemented, unemployment benefit spending and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program) spending automatically rise as more people are unemployed or as their incomes fall. These programs, along with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)—which is currently capped in nominal dollars by federal law—could be restructured in ways that would help them accomplish their core goals and serve as better stabilizers for the economy.

The unemployment insurance (UI) system is a core part of the U.S. response to both individual employment loss and overall labor market disruptions. By insuring workers against job loss, UI partially protects them from important risks while also mitigating the decline in consumption that occurs during a recession. In the sixth chapter, Gabriel Chodorow-Reich and John Coglianese propose changes to improve the take-up of UI, increase its benefits during recessions, and make its extended benefit formulas more responsive to changes in the labor market. These changes would enhance the already sizable role that UI plays in stabilization policy.

After federal welfare reform of 1996, the federal program that provides cash to families in need was block-granted, and funds were capped at their 1997 level. The newly created TANF program included a small emergency fund, which has been insufficient to allow TANF to function as needed for families or provide any cushion to the economy in a downturn. In the seventh chapter, Indivar Dutta-Gupta suggests shifting the structure of TANF so that it can expand in downturns as need rises and thus play a countercyclical role both for households and the economy. He also reviews the experience of TANF job subsidies enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and proposes expanding this approach, explaining how employment subsidies can play an important role as part of an overall policy response to economic downturns.

SNAP is the nation’s most-important food support program—and it is also an automatic stabilizer that supports the economy during downturns. In the eighth chapter, Hilary Hoynes and Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach propose reforms to SNAP that would make it a more-effective automatic stabilizer and increase its ability to protect families during downturns. In particular, they focus on ensuring that families in need of food support are not tied to work requirements that may be impossible to meet in an economic downturn; they also suggest increasing SNAP benefits during a recession.

Overall, this set of proposals builds on the best available evidence and analysis. They use programs that have been effective parts of U.S. fiscal policy and have either been an important part of discretionary or automatic spending in prior downturns. The proposals suggest a clear path toward improved automatic stabilizers for the U.S. economy. These programs already exist or have been pursued in the past, suggesting they are feasible and realistic. Though these policies could be implemented separately, there is an advantage in thinking of them as a package. As described in the first chapter, these policies would affect the economy at different points in time, would assist different types of households, and would address differences in economic conditions across places.

Direct payments are fast and can be executed on a large scale, but are not targeted to struggling regions or households. Likewise, though payments to states can stabilize their budgets, they do not necessarily help individuals who have lost their job or lift consumption. Transportation spending is sometimes done over a slightly longer time frame, but this allows continued spending as the economy recovers. Finally, the safety net policies are likely the best targeted, both to individuals and regions, given that their spending rises wherever economic distress is highest. Unemployment insurance is more likely to help middle-income families, while TANF and SNAP are targeted to low-income families. By setting up an array of stabilizers, policymakers can ensure that a wide range of families are supported and that demand in the economy is boosted across a variety of sectors.

Recessions exact a major toll on individuals, families, firms, and budgets throughout the United States. A key aspect of proper macroeconomic policymaking is to minimize losses by responding quickly and effectively to downturns. As discussed in the next chapter, lower interest rates have left the Federal Reserve with less room to cut rates in response to a downturn. This makes it all the more important that policymakers set in place the proper fiscal structures to make sure that fiscal policy plays an active and efficient role in combating recessions.

Economic forecasters rarely correctly call the timing of a recession. Perhaps the one thing they can all agree on, however, is that another economic downturn will come. A crucial part of preparing for the next recession is making sure fiscal policy institutions are ready to provide support when needed to minimize the damage the next recession could do.","(4, 'national debt')"

At the Global Conference on Equity and Excellence in Basic Education, in Shanghai, China, May 17-19, 2016, the World Bank will be discussing Shanghai’s eminence in ranking highly in international achievement tests. The conference will also cover how good policy can help improve education quality in other countries. See slideshow, press release, key findings .





“Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach a man to fish and he will eat for a lifetime.”- Laozi (老子), ancient Chinese philosopher and writer, known as the reputed author of the Tao Te Ching. He is the founder of philosophical Taoism and is worshipped as a deity in Taoism and traditional Chinese religions.





There are more children in school today than ever before. For example, in 1950 the average level of schooling in Africa was less than two years. It is more than five years today. In East Asia and the Pacific, the schooling of the population went from two to seven years between 1950 and 2010. This is a more than a 200 percent increase! Globally, average years of schooling are now projected to rise to 10 years by 2050. This is larger than a five-fold increase within a century and a half.

Yet, there are still 124 million children and adolescents not in school. Also, more than 250 million school children cannot read, even after several years of schooling.



Here are five things you should know about the pivotal role of education in economic development:



Education is an investment



The importance of knowledge and learning has been recognized since the beginning of time. Plato wrote: “If a man neglects education, he walks lame to the end of his life.”



But it was really the Nobel winning economists that put the argument of education as investment. T.W. Schultz argued that investment in education explains growth and Gary Becker gave us the Human Capital Theory.



In a nutshell, the Human Capital Theory posits that investing in education has a payoff in terms of higher wages. Moreover, the theory and empirical estimates are backed up by current science, as explained by James Heckman.



Neurogenesis tells us that learning can continue into advanced ages. The relative costs and benefits to investments in older persons compared to younger persons differs. Investments in more able workers at any age generate higher returns than investments in less able workers, and ability is formed at early ages.



Education pays



Overall, another year of schooling raises earnings by 10 percent a year. This is typically more than any other investment an individual could make:

The value of human capital – the share of human capital in total wealth – is 62 percent. That’s four times the value of produced capital and 15 times the value of natural capital. Globally, we – governments, private sector, families, individuals – spend more than $5.6 trillion a year on education and training. Countries spend 5 percent of GDP on education or 20 percent of their national budget. Education employs about five percent of the labor force.Moreover, private returns to schooling – what individuals receive in the labor market – have been increasing. Returns are increasing by more than 20 percent in Africa and more than 14 percent in East Asia and the Pacific. The big change recently has been that the returns to tertiary education are now highest.One of the reasons for the change in the returns pattern is the race between technology and education, as labor markets adjust to automation. In this new world, the ability of workers to compete is handicapped by the poor performance of education systems in most developing countries. Technological change and global competition demand the mastery of competencies and the acquisition of new skills for many.To promote success in today’s labor market, one needs to invest early, and then invest in the relevant skills (see below). Above all, countries need to invest smartly, by promoting attention to the 3 A’s : Autonomy, Accountability, Assessment. They need to pay attention to teachers, early childhood development and culture.Education systems that do well prepare children early on, reform continuously, and use information for improvement and accountability. Information for accountability works, as do high stakes assessment; but so do low stakes assessments. Either way, test-based accountability is cost-effective. ""Even if accountability costs were 10 times as large as they are, they would still not amount to 1 percent of the cost of public education"" ( Hoxby ).Countries need to improve quality, strive for excellence, and expand opportunities, based on efficiency and equity. This means ensuring that disadvantaged youth enroll and succeed.While the returns to schooling are high on averageresults vary ( Montenegro and Patrinos 2014 There must be better information for such student who don’t perform well and greater support networks to help them take on the challenges of completing their tertiary level education. More information will also benefit students and families from disadvantaged backgrounds, who tend to overestimate benefits and underestimate costs.Education is truly one of the most powerful instruments for reducing poverty and inequality and it sets the foundation for sustained economic growth. Let’s start investing in it more.Follow Harry Anthony Patrinos on Twitter at @hpatrinos Find out more about the World Bank Group’s work on education on Twitter and Flipboard.","(1, 'employment/wages')"

Restoring the Conditions for Strong and Sustainable Growth

Text

The sub-Saharan African economic outlook remains clouded. Growth slowed sharply in 2016, averaging 1.4 percent, the lowest in two decades. About two-thirds of the countries in the region, together accounting for 83 percent of the region’s GDP, slowed down—although some countries still continued to expand strongly. A modest rebound in growth to 2.6 percent is expected in 2017, but even that rebound will be to a large extent driven by one-off factors in the three largest countries—a recovery in oil production in Nigeria, higher public spending ahead of the elections in Angola, and the fading of drought effects in South Africa, combined in all three countries with modest improvements in the terms of trade. At this rate, growth for the region as a whole will continue to fall well short of past trends and barely deliver any per capita gains.","(0, 'GDP')"

The pickup in global growth anticipated in the April World Economic Outlook remains on track, with global output projected to grow by 3.5 percent in 2017 and 3.6 percent in 2018. The unchanged global growth projections mask somewhat different contributions at the country level. U.S. growth projections are lower than in April, primarily reflecting the assumption that fiscal policy will be less expansionary going forward than previously anticipated. Growth has been revised up for Japan and especially the euro area, where positive surprises to activity in late 2016 and early 2017 point to solid momentum. China’s growth projections have also been revised up, reflecting a strong first quarter of 2017 and expectations of continued fiscal support. Inflation in advanced economies remains subdued and generally below targets; it has also been declining in several emerging economies, such as Brazil, India, and Russia.

While risks around the global growth forecast appear broadly balanced in the near term, they remain skewed to the downside over the medium term. On the upside, the cyclical rebound could be stronger and more sustained in Europe, where political risk has diminished. On the downside, rich market valuations and very low volatility in an environment of high policy uncertainty raise the likelihood of a market correction, which could dampen growth and confidence. The more supportive policy tilt in China, especially strong credit growth, comes with rising downside risks to medium-term growth. Monetary policy normalization in some advanced economies, notably the United States, could trigger a faster-than-anticipated tightening in global financial conditions. And other risks discussed in the April 2017 WEO, including a turn toward inward-looking policies and geopolitical risks, remain salient.



Projected global growth rates for 2017–18, though higher than the 3.2 percent estimated for 2016, are below pre-crisis averages, especially for most advanced economies and for commodity-exporting emerging and developing economies. Among the former, many face excess capacity as well as headwinds to potential growth from aging populations, weak investment, and slowly advancing productivity. In view of weak core inflation and muted wage pressures, policy settings should remain consistent with lifting inflation expectations in line with targets, closing output gaps, and—where appropriate—external rebalancing. Reforms to boost potential output are of the essence, and slow aggregate output growth makes it even more important that gains are shared widely across the income distribution. Financial stability risks need close monitoring in many emerging economies. Commodity exporters should continue adjusting to lower revenues, while diversifying their sources of growth over time.

The Global Economy Maintains Momentum

The cyclical recovery continues. Growth outturns in the first quarter of 2017 were higher than the April WEO forecasts in large emerging and developing economies such as Brazil, China, and Mexico, and in several advanced economies including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. High-frequency indicators for the second quarter provide signs of continued strengthening of global activity. Specifically, growth in global trade and industrial production remained well above 2015–16 rates despite retreating from the very strong pace registered in late 2016 and early 2017. Purchasing managers’ indices (PMIs) signal sustained strength ahead in manufacturing and services.

Commodities and inflation. Oil prices have receded, reflecting strong inventory levels in the United States and a pickup in supply. Headline inflation also generally softened as the impact of the commodity price rebound of the second half of 2016 faded, and remains at levels well below central bank targets in most advanced economies. Core inflation has remained broadly stable. It has largely been stable in emerging economies as well, with a few, such as Brazil and Russia, witnessing strong declines.

Bond and equity markets. Long-term bond yields in advanced economies, which had declined since March, rebounded in late June and early July. The U.S. Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates in June, but markets still expect a very gradual path of U.S. monetary policy normalization. Bond spreads over Germany have compressed sharply in France, Italy, and Spain on reduced electoral uncertainty and firming signs of recovery. Equity prices in advanced economies remain strong, signaling continued market optimism regarding corporate earnings. Markets are also optimistic about emerging market prospects as reflected in strengthening equity markets and some further compression of interest rate spreads. Oil exporters provide an exception to this pattern, in light of the marked weakening of oil prices since March.

Exchange rates and capital flows. As of end-June, the U.S. dollar has depreciated by around 3½ percent in real effective terms since March, while the euro has strengthened by a similar amount on increased confidence in the euro area recovery and a decline in political risk. Over the same period, exchange rate changes across emerging market currencies have been relatively modest, with some strengthening of the Mexican peso on tighter monetary policy and reduced concerns about U.S. trade frictions, and a depreciation of the Brazilian real on renewed political uncertainty. Capital flows to emerging economies have been resilient in the first few months of 2017, with a notable pickup in non-resident portfolio inflows.

Global Growth Forecast to Pick up in 2017 and 2018

Global growth for 2016 is now estimated at 3.2 percent, slightly stronger than the April 2017 forecast, primarily reflecting much higher growth in Iran and stronger activity in India following national accounts revisions. Economic activity in both advanced economies and emerging and developing economies is forecast to accelerate in 2017, to 2 percent and 4.6 percent respectively, with global growth projected to be 3.5 percent, unchanged from the April forecast. The growth forecast for 2018 is 1.9 percent for advanced economies, 0.1 percentage point below the April 2017 WEO, and 4.8 percent for emerging and developing economies, the same as in the spring. The 2018 global growth forecast is unchanged at 3.6 percent. The revisions reflect primarily the macroeconomic implications of changes in policy assumptions for the world’s two largest economies, the United States and China, as discussed below.

Advanced economies

The growth forecast in the United States has been revised down from 2.3 percent to 2.1 percent in 2017 and from 2.5 percent to 2.1 percent in 2018. While the markdown in the 2017 forecast reflects in part the weak growth outturn in the first quarter of the year, the major factor behind the growth revision, especially for 2018, is the assumption that fiscal policy will be less expansionary than previously assumed, given the uncertainty about the timing and nature of U.S. fiscal policy changes. Market expectations of fiscal stimulus have also receded.

By contrast, growth projections for 2017 have been revised up for many euro area countries , including France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, where growth for the first quarter of 2017 was generally above expectations. This, together with positive growth revisions for the last quarter of 2016 and high-frequency indicators for the second quarter of 2017, indicate stronger momentum in domestic demand than previously anticipated.

The growth forecast for 2017 was also revised up for Canada, where buoyant domestic demand boosted first-quarter growth to 3.7 percent and indicators suggest resilient second-quarter activity, and marginally for Japan, where private consumption, investment, and exports supported first-quarter growth.

Emerging and developing economies

Emerging and developing economies are projected to see a sustained pickup in activity, with growth rising from 4.3 percent in 2016 to 4.6 percent in 2017 and 4.8 percent in 2018. These forecasts reflect upward revisions, relative to April, of 0.2 percentage point for 2016, and 0.1 percentage point for 2017. As in the most recent WEO forecast vintages, growth is primarily driven by commodity importers, but its pickup reflects to an important extent gradually improving conditions in large commodity exporters that experienced recessions in 2015–16, in many cases caused or exacerbated by declining commodity prices.

China’s growth is expected to remain at 6.7 percent in 2017, the same level as in 2016, and to decline only modestly in 2018 to 6.4 percent. The forecast for 2017 was revised up by 0.1 percentage point, reflecting the stronger than expected outturn in the first quarter of the year underpinned by previous policy easing and supply-side reforms (including efforts to reduce excess capacity in the industrial sector). For 2018, the upward revision of 0.2 percentage point mainly reflects an expectation that the authorities will delay the needed fiscal adjustment (especially by maintaining high public investment) to meet their target of doubling 2010 real GDP by 2020. Delay comes at the cost of further large increases in debt, however, so downside risks around this baseline have also increased.

Growth in India is forecast to pick up further in 2017 and 2018, in line with the April 2017 forecast. While activity slowed following the currency exchange initiative, growth for 2016––at 7.1 percent––was higher than anticipated due to strong government spending and data revisions that show stronger momentum in the first part of the year. With a pickup in global trade and strengthening domestic demand, growth in the ASEAN-5 economies is projected to remain robust at around 5 percent, with generally strong first quarter outturns leading to a slight upward revision for 2017 relative to the April WEO.

The Russian economy is projected to recover gradually in 2017 and 2018, in line with the April forecast.

The Russian economy is projected to recover gradually in 2017 and 2018, in line with the April forecast. After contracting in 2016, economic activity in Latin America is projected to recover gradually in 2017–18 as a few countries––including Argentina and Brazil—exit their recessions. In comparison to the April 2017 WEO, Brazil’s growth forecast for 2017 is now higher in light of the strong first quarter, but ongoing weakness in domestic demand and an increase in political and policy uncertainty will be reflected in a more subdued pace of recovery, and hence in lower projected growth in 2018. Mexico’s growth forecast for 2017 is revised up from 1.7 to 1.9 percent on the back of strong activity in the first quarter of the year, with an unchanged forecast for 2018. Revisions for the rest of the region are mostly to the downside, including a further deterioration of conditions in Venezuela.

Growth in the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan region is projected to slow considerably in 2017, reflecting primarily a slowdown in activity in oil exporters, before recovering in 2018. The 2017–18 forecast is broadly unchanged relative to the April 2017 WEO, but the growth outcome in 2016 is estimated to have been considerably stronger in light of higher growth in Iran. The recent decline in oil prices, if sustained, could weigh further on the outlook for the region’s oil exporters.

The recent decline in oil prices, if sustained, could weigh further on the outlook for the region’s oil exporters. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the outlook remains challenging. Growth is projected to rise in 2017 and 2018, but will barely return to positive territory in per capita terms this year for the region as a whole—and would remain negative for about a third of the countries in the region. The slight upward revision to 2017 growth relative to the April 2017 WEO forecast reflects a modest upgrading of growth prospects for South Africa, which is experiencing a bumper crop due to better rainfall and an increase in mining output prompted by a moderate rebound in commodity prices. However, the outlook for South Africa remains difficult, with elevated political uncertainty and weak consumer and business confidence, and the country’s growth forecast was consequently marked down for 2018.

Risks

Short-term risks are broadly balanced, but medium-term risks are still skewed to the downside. Risks to the U.S. forecast are two sided: the implementation of a fiscal stimulus (such as revenue-reducing tax reform) could drive U.S. demand and output growth above the baseline forecast, while implementation of the expenditure-based consolidation proposed in the Administration’s budget would drive them lower. On the upside, the pickup in activity in the euro area, with buoyant market sentiment and reduced political risks, could be stronger and more durable than currently projected. On the downside, protracted policy uncertainty or other shocks could trigger a correction in rich market valuations, especially for equities, and an increase in volatility from current very low levels. In turn, this could dent spending and confidence more generally, especially in countries with high financial vulnerabilities. Lower commodity prices would further exacerbate macroeconomic strains and complicate adjustment needs in many commodity exporters. Other downside risks threatening the strength and durability of the recovery include:

A more protracted period of policy uncertainty. Despite a decline in election-related risks, policy uncertainty remains at a high level and could well rise further, reflecting—for example—difficult-to-predict U.S. regulatory and fiscal policies, negotiations of post-Brexit arrangements, or geopolitical risks. This could harm confidence, deter private investment, and weaken growth.

Financial tensions. In China, failure to continue the recent focus on addressing financial sector risks and curb excessive credit growth (mainly through tighter macroprudential policy settings) could result in an abrupt growth slowdown, with adverse spillovers to other countries through trade, commodity price, and confidence channels. A faster-than-expected monetary policy normalization in the United States could tighten global financial conditions and trigger reversals in capital flows to emerging economies, along with U.S. dollar appreciation, straining emerging economies with large leverage, U.S. dollar pegs, or balance sheet mismatches. At the same time, to the extent that such monetary policy tightening reflects a stronger U.S. outlook, U.S. trading partners would benefit from positive demand spillovers. In some euro area countries, weak bank balance sheets and an unfavorable profitability outlook could interact with higher political risks to reignite financial stability concerns, and a rise in long-term interest rates would worsen public debt dynamics. Finally, a broad rollback of the strengthening of financial regulation and oversight achieved since the crisis—both nationally and internationally—could lower capital and liquidity buffers or weaken supervisory effectiveness, with negative repercussions for global financial stability.

Inward-looking policies. Over the longer term, failure to lift potential growth and make growth more inclusive could fuel protectionism and hinder market-friendly reforms. The results could include disrupted global supply chains, lower global productivity, and less affordable tradable consumer goods, which harm low-income households disproportionately.

Noneconomic factors. Rising geopolitical tensions, domestic political discord, and shocks arising from weak governance and corruption can all weigh on economic activity.

These risks are interconnected and can be mutually reinforcing. For example, an inward turn in policies could be associated with increased geopolitical tensions as well as with rising global risk aversion; noneconomic shocks can weigh directly on economic activity as well as harm confidence and market sentiment; and a faster-than-anticipated tightening of global financial conditions or a shift toward protectionism in advanced economies could reignite capital outflow pressures from emerging markets.

Policies

Policy choices will therefore be crucial in shaping the outlook and reducing risks.

Strengthening the momentum. With countries at present facing divergent cyclical conditions, differing stances of monetary and fiscal policy remain appropriate. In advanced economies where demand is still lacking and inflation too low, monetary and (where feasible) fiscal support should continue; elsewhere monetary policy should normalize gradually, in line with economic developments, and fiscal policy should focus on supporting reforms aimed at expanding the economy’s supply potential. Countries in need of fiscal consolidation should do so with growth-friendly measures. Emerging market economies should continue to allow exchange rates to buffer shocks, wherever possible.

Making growth resilient and balanced. Efforts to accelerate private sector balance sheet repair and ensure sustainability of public debt are critical foundations for a resilient recovery. So are efforts from surplus and deficit countries alike to reduce excess current account imbalances.

Sustaining high and inclusive growth in the long term. This goal calls for well-sequenced and tailored structural reforms to boost productivity and investment, measures to narrow gender labor force participation gaps, and active support for those hurt by shifts in technology or trade.

Enhancing resilience in low-income countries. Among low-income developing countries, commodity exporters generally need sizable adjustment to correct macroeconomic imbalances, a challenge that would be exacerbated for fuel exporters by a persistent decline in oil prices. Policy priorities for diversified low-income developing countries vary, given the diversity of country circumstances, but an overarching goal for these economies should be to enhance resilience against potential future shocks by strengthening fiscal positions and foreign reserves holdings while growth is strong.

Working toward shared prosperity. A well-functioning multilateral framework for international economic relations is another key ingredient of strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth. Pursuit of zero-sum policies can only end by hurting all countries, as history shows. Because national policies inevitably interact and create spillovers across countries, the world economy works far better for all when policymakers engage in regular dialogue and work within agreed mechanisms to resolve disagreements. A rule-based and open world trading system is especially vital for global prosperity, but it must be supported by domestic policies to facilitate adjustment, not only to trade but to rapid technological change.

Cooperating to ensure evenhandedness. At the same time, the international community should continue to adapt the multilateral system to the changing global economy. Active dialogue and cooperation will help to improve and modernize the rules, while addressing valid country concerns. This process will ensure continued mutual benefits and evenhandedness. Together with strong domestic policies, it will also help avoid a broad withdrawal from multilateralism, either through widespread protectionism or a competitive race to the bottom in financial and regulatory oversight, which would leave all countries worse off.","(0, 'GDP')"

Nearly six-in-ten people in the United States (58%) say the economic situation is very or somewhat good, according to a new Pew Research Center survey conducted Feb. 16-March 15. Last spring, 44% of the American public described the economy as good.

This is the most positive assessment of U.S. economic conditions since 2007, and only the second time that half or more of those surveyed have given the economy a thumbs-up. Driving the latest increase is a jump among Republicans over the past year.

The 14-percentage-point rise in overall public opinion about the economy since last year is the largest one-year improvement in public sentiment about economic conditions in the history of this survey. The current rosy assessment stands in stark contrast to where opinion stood immediately after the beginning of the financial crisis in spring 2008, when just 20% said economic conditions were good.

These findings track with the results of earlier polls by Pew Research Center, Gallup and others, though question wording in some cases is slightly different. All show public assessment of the economy has improved in the last year, mirroring changes in underlying economic conditions. In February 2017 (the last month for which data are available), the unemployment rate was 4.7%, down from 4.9% in February 2016; and the Dow Jones Industrial Average index was 20,812 in February 2017, up from 16,517 a year earlier.

Strikingly, there is currently no major partisan difference in public views of the economy. But the more positive public assessment of the economy these days has been driven by changing Republican attitudes. Roughly six-in-ten Republicans (61%) and Democrats (60%) say conditions are very or somewhat good, with sentiment among GOP supporters roughly doubling in the past year. More than half (54%) of independents agree. Just a year ago there was a 26-percentage-point partisan difference on economic conditions, with Democrats being far more bullish on the economy than Republicans. This was the case throughout the Obama administration.

Several demographic groups are particularly satisfied with the economy, including men, older Americans, wealthier Americans and those with more education.

Middle-aged and older Americans have positive views of economic conditions. Roughly six-in-ten people ages 30 to 49 (61%) and 50 and older (59%) say the economy is very or somewhat good. And about half (49%) of Americans ages 18 to 29 agree.

In the past year, perception of the economy has improved across all age groups. Positive views have gained by 7 percentage points among younger people, by 16 points among middle-aged Americans and by 15 points among older people.

Two-thirds (67%) of those who make $75,000 or more a year think economic conditions are positive, as do roughly half of those who make less.

College graduates and those with even more education are particularly happy with the economy, with 69% saying it is in good shape. But even those with less education – some college or a high school diploma or less – see current economic conditions as very or somewhat good.

“Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before,” Trump said.

It’s the same way Trump talked about what he could do for the economy in 2016, when he campaigned as a savvy businessman who would revitalize the economy by bringing back manufacturing jobs and transform the U.S. approach to global trade.

WATCH: Trump delivers 2019 State of the Union

Two years into his presidency, and with the 2020 presidential election on the horizon, Trump used Tuesday’s State of the Union address to argue he’s kept his word.

The president has taken steps to boost the economy, through a combination of tax cuts, cutting regulations, imposing new tariffs, and shaking up global trade agreements.

But the results have been uneven.

Tariffs on steel and aluminum, for example, appear to have stabilized industries that were on the decline. But other import taxes on Chinese goods have cut into farmers’ bottom lines and cost American consumers in the form of higher prices.

The 2017 Republican tax law temporarily boosted economic productivity and led to some additional hiring in the manufacturing and construction sectors, but tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations increased the nation’s deficit and companies said they were not necessarily investing more in workers, as Republicans had promised.

Trump has staked much of his presidency on the economy, and on Tuesday, he aimed to convince Americans that the benefits of his policies far outweigh the downsides. It’s a message he is likely to repeat many times before 2020, when voters will decide whether they want to continue those policies for another four years.

Here’s a closer look at the issues Trump highlighted in the State of the Union, and how they are playing out across the U.S. and global economies.

“JOBS, JOBS, JOBS”

The U.S. unemployment rate sits right around 4 percent, as it did for most of 2018.

January marked the 100th consecutive month of jobs gains. Wages are rising. Inflation is near 2 percent, a level most economists view as ideal.

Whether Trump or President Barack Obama, who was in office when the economic recovery began, should get the credit for those job gains remains up for debate.

Regardless, job growth is strong, although Trump stretched the numbers in his State of the Union address.

Employers have added 4.9 million jobs since Trump took office–less than the 5.3 million Trump cited in his speech.

Manufacturing added about 450,000 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, with the mining and logging sectors experiencing particularly strong growth. Trump said Tuesday night that 600,000 manufacturing jobs had been created.

Trump frequently touts these numbers on Twitter, sometimes with the rallying cry of “JOBS, JOBS JOBS.”

He also often takes credit for the stock market, which has risen about 25 percent since he took office, though it did experience a major a downturn last December.

“When things are good, politicians always take credit, and when things are bad, they try to blame their predecessor,” said Michael Farren, a research fellow at the George Mason University Mercatus Center who focuses on government and economics.

The job news under Trump hasn’t been all positive, though — a reminder that presidents have limited control of the economy.

General Motors announced late last year that it would lay off about 14,000 workers, with the latest round taking place Monday. The construction equipment manufacturer Caterpillar announced a series of layoffs last year, as did Carrier, the air conditioning company Trump said he convinced to reverse its plans to move production to Mexico.

The last two years have been a roller coaster for workers like Tom Wolikow, who was laid off from GM’s Lordstown, Ohio, plant after working there for nine years. He recently landed a job at another GM plant in Flint, Michigan, but to get the job he had to leave his family in Ohio. Wolikow did not vote in the 2016 election but said he was excited when the president came to Youngstown, Ohio, in 2017, promising jobs would come back to the region.

“I took him for his word,” Wolikow said in a recent phone interview. But the hope quickly faded. “All I’ve been seeing is job loss in my area. It’s really hard to think he’s doing something for our area when it seems the opposite is happening.”

“All I’ve been seeing is job loss in my area.”

White House officials insist they are doing everything they can to save manufacturing jobs, pointing to Foxconn’s decision last week to go ahead with a manufacturing facility after Trump intervened.

Trump also said “Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before.”

While the number of women who are working is at an historic high at about 76.6 million, the rate of women in the labor force remains at about 57 percent, below the peak of 60 percent reached in 1999.

Taxes and deregulation

The Republican tax bill Trump signed into law in December 2017 arguably remains his biggest legislative achievement as president, although the deal only received a passing mention in the State of the Union.

The tax overhaul reduced the corporate income tax rate form 35 percent to 21 percent, lowered taxes for the wealthy and some middle class families, gave tax write-offs to businesses that invested in the U.S., and doubled the standard deduction for individuals.

The tax cuts did boost the GDP for two quarters in 2018, but those effects are starting to wane. The construction and manufacturing industries reported in a recent survey that the tax cuts did cause them to boost hiring and investment, but more than 80 percent of all U.S. businesses said the tax overhaul did not change their hiring or investment decisions.

Businesses are also increasingly worried that U.S. trade policy is dragging down the global economy.

The Trump administration has also rolled back a number of Obama-era regulatory measures, another top campaign promise from Trump during the 2016 election. Those include restrictions on oil and natural gas production and power plant emissions, regulations that aimed to increase protection for employees, as well as a number of rules on smaller banks.

“I think the tax cuts and the deregulation are definitely pro-growth and have helped. But we’re going to have to deal with the aftermath of that as well,” said Dan North, the chief economist at Euler Hermes North America.

The “aftermath” includes a bigger deficit, and, potentially, more income inequality.

“The most massive parts of the tax cut went to wealthy families, not the middle class,” said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who was an economic adviser to Vice President Joseph Biden in the Obama Administration. He added that the tax cuts for the middle class are set to expire in 2025, while the corporate tax cuts are permanent.

The U.S. economy is expected to stay strong in the coming months, but economists are increasingly predicting a slowdown at the end of the year as the stimulus from the 2017 Republican tax cuts and increased federal spending wears off.

Businesses are also increasingly worried that U.S. trade policy is dragging down the global economy.

A host of tariffs

Trump reiterated in his speech Tuesday what has become a key focus of his economic agenda: trade.

“To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount: reversing decades of calamitous trade policies,” Trump said.

Last year, Trump implemented a host of new tariffs in an effort to gain leverage with countries he viewed as taking advantage of the U.S. China has been the main target of the import taxes, but U.S. allies, including Canada and the EU, have also been impacted.

The first set of tariffs, put in place last June, was a 25 percent tax on imported steel and a 10 percent tax on imported aluminum.

A report from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute found last year that the tariffs have boosted aluminum production by about 60 percent.

“President Trump has given us an opportunity to bounce back.”

– Mark Glyptis, United Steelworkers Union

Mark Glyptis, the president of the United Steelworkers Union Local 2911 in Weirton, West Virginia, said the tariffs are a “welcomed relief” to an industry that has long been in decline. Before the tariffs, mills were shutting down every year across the country, but now, Glyptis said, prices are rising and the industry is stabilizing.

“President Trump has given us an opportunity to bounce back,” Glyptis said.

But in response to Trump’s tariffs, China imposed a 25 percent tax on U.S. soybeans, which caused a 94 percent drop in soybean exports to China. American Farmers took a major hit, prompting the Trump administration to offer them $9.6 billion in direct payments to help make up for the losses.

Many farmers live in traditionally conservative states and still support the president. Yet others have grown increasingly frustrated at his suggestions that farmers should be willing to take a short-term hit for a longer-term gain.

In July, Trump urged patience, tweeting that he was “fighting for a level playing field for our farmers” but that negotiations “can’t go too quickly.”

…things up, better than ever before, but it can’t go too quickly. I am fighting for a level playing field for our farmers, and will win! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 11, 2018

“The problem is, I don’t trust him anymore, because he says a lot of things,” said Vanessa Kummer, whose family owns a corn and soybean farm in Colfax, North Dakota. “He uses a lot of rhetoric, and I don’t see the real follow through,” she said in a phone interview. “I don’t see him really getting back to fixing relationships with our trading partners.”

Some good news came for farmers last week when the European Union approved U.S. soybeans for use in biofuels, fulfilling a deal Trump and EU Commissioner Jean Claude Juncker made last year. Industry analysts say the move opens up a new market to U.S. suppliers, but will only lead to a modest boost for farmers overall.

The China dispute

On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly called out China, which is threatening to replace the U.S. as the world’s largest economy, for “unfair trade practices.” As president, he has put the U.S. relationship with China at the heart of his economic policy.

He put pressure on the country in 2018 in the form of tariffs, prompting China to impose retaliatory tariffs. Tensions threatened to spiral out of control until late last year, when Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping agreed to a temporary truce.

Now, Trump has set a deadline of March 1 to make a deal regarding tariffs, the forced transfer of technology from U.S. firms that operate in China to state-owned enterprises, and access to China’s consumer market. If a deal is not reached, he has threatened to imposes more tariffs on nearly all Chinese goods.

“I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China,” Trump said Tuesday. “But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.”

Coming to an agreement will not be easy.

“We are asking the Chinese to switch to a market economy that will undercut the [Communist] Party’s control,” said Bill Reinsch, an international business scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Reinsch predicted the two parties will come to some sort of smaller agreement, perhaps one that would change some of the rules U.S. companies in China have to follow. But the changes will most likely be cosmetic, he said.

Trade experts say Trump’s trade dealings with China are working out better than many of them expected. U.S. consumers often pay the cost of tariffs in the form of higher prices on goods. But American companies have been able to absorb some of the cost themselves or switch to suppliers based in companies outside of China.

Some companies such as Apple are expecting sales in China to drop because of the retaliatory tariffs China put on U.S. goods. But China’s economy has taken the harder hit, potentially giving the U.S. a leg up in the most recent round of negotiations.

The Trump administration has “certainly been successful in creating a lot of leverage,” said Tim Keeler, a former chief of staff to the U.S. trade representative in the George W. Bush administration. The question, Keeler said, is: Are they going to spend that capital too soon by accepting a bad deal?

NAFTA

Trump on Tuesday said the trade deal the administration negotiated to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement would bring back manufacturing jobs, expand American agriculture and ensure more cars are “made in the USA.”

In reality, the new U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement, as it’s called, largely mirrors NAFTA–a deal Trump called an “historic trade blunder” and “catastrophe” on Tuesday–with some increased protections for workers. Some economists are also skeptical about whether the new agreement will actually lead to more cars being made in the U.S.

The three countries’ leaders agreed to the deal last year, but it has to be approved legislatively before it goes into effect.

In the U.S., the trade pact must be ratified by Congress, but it faces opposition from Democrats, who are pushing for more enforcement provisions to ensure Mexico complies with rules to boost pay and support organized labor.

“This thing is not doomed. If you handle it right, you can get it through, but it will take some patience,” Reinsch said of Congress ratifying the deal.

Trump appears increasingly impatient. Trump has previously to repeal NAFTA if the Democratic-controlled House does not approve the new trade deal. That would leave the U.S. with no agreement governing its trade with Canada and Mexico, which would cause a major disruption for businesses in all three countries.

If that happens, “it’s a very big deal,” Keeler said.","(0, 'GDP')"

Enlarge this image toggle caption Bryan R. Smith/AFP/Getty Images Bryan R. Smith/AFP/Getty Images

The U.S. economy is chugging along. Employers added 201,000 jobs last month, and the unemployment rate held steady at a low 3.9 percent. Average wages in August were nearly 3 percent higher than they were a year ago.

Who should get the credit for that strong performance?

At a campaign rally in North Dakota last week, President Trump boasted that he's responsible for the economy taking off like a ""rocket ship.""

But Trump's predecessor wants to remind everyone that the countdown began on his watch.

""When you hear how great the economy is doing right now, let's just remember when this recovery started,"" former President Barack Obama told supporters Friday at the University of Illinois.

This is not just a question of bragging rights. With midterm elections less than two months away, voters' impressions of who deserves credit for the boom could influence which political party they support in November.

Let's stipulate that presidents of both parties often get more credit and blame for economic conditions than they deserve, given that much of what happens is outside their control. But setting that aside, is Trump simply coasting on the momentum of an already strong Obama economy? Or have things turned around on his watch?

White House economist Kevin Hassett insists that Trump deserves the credit.

""I can promise you that economic historians will 100 percent accept the fact that there was an inflection at the election of Donald Trump and a whole bunch of data items started heading north,"" said Hassett, who chairs the council of economic advisers.

""Inflection"" is just a fancy word for turning point. So Hassett is arguing that conditions since Trump was elected are significantly different than conditions were before.

It's hard to see such a turning point in major economic yardsticks such as jobs, unemployment, or wages.

(If you're not seeing the charts, click here for interactives on total U.S. payrolls, the jobless rate and average hourly earnings over time.)

Job growth has been remarkably consistent since the end of the recession in 2010. The 3.6 million jobs added in the 19 months since Trump took office are roughly comparable to the 3.9 million added in the previous 19 months under Obama. Likewise, unemployment has steadily declined. And wages have inched up at a slow but steady pace.

On a graph of any of these metrics, the period before Trump took office is virtually indistinguishable from the period since.

""At best, you would say it's been a continuation of a steady trend,"" economist Austan Goolsbee told MSNBC.

Goolsbee, who had Hassett's job early in the Obama administration, challenged the idea that things suddenly improved following Trump's election.

""I don't see how you come into the game with 10 minutes left in the fourth quarter, your team is already ahead, and you're like, 'I won this game.' ""

But Hassett presented his own charts to back up the idea of a Trump turning point.

Enlarge this image toggle caption White House Council of Economic Advisers White House Council of Economic Advisers

One area he focused on is the growth in what the Labor Department calls ""goods-producing"" jobs such as manufacturing, construction and oil drilling. (Hassett called these ""blue collar jobs,"" although the term ""blue collar"" can also refer to some service-sector jobs such as custodial or warehouse work.)

Goods-producing employment has accelerated since Trump took office, even as job gains in the much larger service sector have slowed. As Mark Muro and Jacob Whiton of the Brookings Institution have noted, that could be helpful to Republicans in November, since goods-producing jobs tend to be concentrated in redder, more rural parts of the country.

""As the elections approach, smaller, redder places are doing relatively better than they were in 2016,"" Muro and Whiton wrote.

It's important to remember, though, that goods-producing jobs make up a relatively small slice of the overall U.S. economy, accounting for less than 14 percent of the total workforce. By focusing on those jobs, the Trump administration is discounting the industries that employ 86 percent of American workers.

Hassett also highlighted a surge in business investment in property, plants and equipment beginning around the time that Trump was elected.

""What's happened is that the capital spending boom that we promised would happen if we passed the tax cuts is underway,"" Hassett said.

In theory, that additional investment should make workers more productive, boosting both output and wages in the future. But not everyone is convinced that the boom is widespread or that Trump and the tax cuts are responsible.

The president of the federal reserve bank of Atlanta says much of the increased investment is in the energy sector, driven by higher oil prices.

""Excluding energy and oil investment, investment growth is still below 5 percent on a year-over-year basis — a bit lower than the typical expansion average,"" Raphael Bostic told the Savannah, Ga, Rotary Club in June.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Whit House Council of Economic Advisers Whit House Council of Economic Advisers

One area where there is a clear, election-related turning point is small-business sentiment. Members of the NFIB, a Republican-leaning small-business group, were significantly more optimistic after Trump's upset victory in 2016, perhaps anticipating his policies of tax cuts and reduced regulation.

""People started to ratchet up their expectations for what would happen to the economy,"" Hassett said. ""Everybody, except for Mrs. Clinton's supporters, was starting to do that right after the election.""

Significantly, Hassett did not highlight GDP growth, perhaps because the measure has bounced up and down and would not show a clear difference between Trump and Obama. Although Trump often boasts about the strong GDP showing between April and June — when growth topped 4 percent — there were quarters during Obama's tenure when growth was even stronger. Forecasters disagree about whether Trump can deliver sustained, multiyear growth in the 3 percent range, as promised.

So while the White House can certainly point to some yardsticks that indicate a meaningful turnaround on Trump's watch — including small business sentiment, business investment and goods-producing job growth — broader measures of the overall job market and wages show the economy continues to follow the steady, upward glide path that began under Obama.","(1, 'employment/wages')"

President Donald Trump thinks he’s overdue some credit for steering the strongest economy on the planet – and he’s probably right.

“These numbers are very, very sustainable – this isn’t a one-time shot,” Trump said on Friday, speaking from the South Lawn of the White House after news that the US economy grew at a 4.1% annual rate in the second quarter of the year.

Fresh from a trip to the Midwestern heartlands, the President is making the very best possible case for his administration as the pace heats up ahead of the midterm elections. He’s belting out a strong economic message with a fervor that Democrats have yet to match this election cycle.

Presidents usually get too much blame when the economy is doing badly, since downturns are often caused by outside shocks or cyclical factors, but that also gives them a chance to crow when things are going full steam ahead.

Trump is not the kind of person to pass that up.

Often, the President’s hyperbolic assessment of his own performance is at odds with the facts. But Friday’s announcement that the economy grew at a 4.1% pace in the second quarter, the best showing since 2014, is genuine cause for celebration.

It may also be his best chance to argue that a huge and controversial tax cut, the only really significant legislation he has managed to pass, is – as he said it would – unleashing prosperity.

“We’ve never seen anything like (what) is going on right now,” Trump told a hugely supportive crowd of steelworkers in Illinois on Thursday.

“GDP numbers will be announced tomorrow sometime. I don’t know what they are, but I think they’re going to be terrific,” he added. “You know, when we took over it was really low, and it was heading lower, a lot lower. And it was going to be there fast. And great things have happened. So, whatever those numbers are, watch for them. Somebody actually predicted today, 5.3 (%). I don’t think that’s going to happen.”

Looking for a boost

Video Ad Feedback Trump's trade war threatens Midwest farmers 02:55 - Source: CNN

The strong growth number gives the White House a significant boost after days of grim headlines, and its failure to move on from the President’s humiliating summit performance with Russian President Vladimir Putin nearly two weeks ago.

It also offers some personal respite for Trump, given that he must feel that legal walls are closing around him, following news that one of his most important confidants, Allen Weisselberg, has been subpoenaed by federal prosecutors investigating his former lawyer Michael Cohen.

The New York Times reported on Thursday that special counsel Robert Mueller is examining Trump’s tweets, potentially to see whether they can help him build a case that the President acted with malicious intent when he sacked former FBI Director James Comey.

Trump is forever trying to change the subject. With the current state of the economy, he may have some ammunition.

Unemployment is lower than it has been for decades, corporate earnings are strong and it seems unlikely that a sudden crisis is looming that could derail things before Americans head to the polls in midterm elections that will have a huge bearing on Trump’s presidency.

Recent polls show that the economy is one of the few issues where Trump is approaching the kind of numbers that presidents conventionally need to win re-election.

A Quinnipiac University poll conducted from July 18-23 showed that majorities of voters thought Trump had weakened the US abroad, was too close to Putin and lied about important issues. But a near majority – 49% – backed his handling of the economy.

Republican hopes of staving off a Democratic blue wave and boosting Trump’s re-election prospects in 2020 may hinge on more voters deciding that for all the uproar and dislocation and falsehoods of the Trump presidency, he has made them more economically secure and given them a pay raise for which they have waited years.

GOP’s best bet

Video Ad Feedback Trump trade advisor on 'America First' policy 12:46 - Source: CNN

It’s no exaggeration to say that the economy represents Trump’s best argument heading into the fall. And Trump appears to be getting increasingly frustrated that the story is not being told.

Pointing at the press cameras during his trip to Illinois he complained: “They’re dying to see us make a little bit of a mistake.”

“Even though we’ve been here for a little more than a year and a half … we really hit it big over the last six months,” he said.

Trump can make a fair argument that he is not getting the credit he deserves on the economy, but he often has only himself to blame for it getting overlooked, given the daily political turmoil he creates.

And his White House displayed deepening concern in recent days about Trump country districts that sent him to the White House.

While the President claimed Thursday that his steel and aluminum subsidies on China and a clutch of US allies had revived the industry, his trade war threats appear to be having an alarming impact elsewhere.

The administration just unveiled a $12 billion aid program for farmers slammed by Chinese reprisals targeting Trump voters that are already having a painful impact on US soybean and pork exports.

The President also appeared to step back from the brink of a trade war with the European Union on Wednesday, basically agreeing to a deal to just start talking about tariff cuts.

“We just opened up Europe,” Trump said in Dubuque, Iowa, earlier Thursday, misleadingly overstating the significance of his deal with Europe .

Key House and gubernatorial races in states that Trump won and will need again in 2020 are beginning to increasingly get bogged down in debate over the direction of Trump’s trade policies. A set of NBC/Marist polls this week showed his approval rating down below 40% in Michigan and Wisconsin, which paved his way to the presidency.

There’s also plenty of scope to quibble with the substance of Trump’s economic claims. While growth may be roaring, critics say the tax cuts may not filter down significantly to blue-collar Americans and are certain to widen economic inequality.

The GOP, which once prided itself – at least in opposition – on fiscal responsibility, has exploded the deficit. Wage growth, long the downside of the recovery since the Great Recession, is still fairly flat, meaning that to some voters, Trump’s end zone dance might come across as a little premature.","(0, 'GDP')"

Story Highlights Trump's handling of economy (56%) and unemployment (54%) rank highest

43% overall job approval rating remains higher than January readings

Handling Russia, race relations, government corruption, Syria rank lowest

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- President Donald Trump's rating for handling the economy, 56%, is the highest of his presidency and the highest of his approval ratings on any of 14 domestic and foreign issues tested in the latest Gallup poll. Americans' approval of his handling of unemployment is nearly as high, at 54%. At the same time, his overall 43% job approval rating is essentially unchanged since earlier in February but appears to be stabilizing at a higher level than it had been in late 2018 and early 2019.

Still, his overall approval rating is likely dragged down by some of the issues that garner his lowest ratings -- relations with Russia (39%), race relations (38%), corruption in government (37%) and the situation in Syria (35%).

The poll, conducted Feb. 12-28, found Trump's only other approval rating above the 50% mark was his handling of the situation with North Korea. This 51% approval rating is up five percentage points since August and is the highest Trump has received on the issue during his presidency. Most interviews in the poll were conducted during the runup to his second denuclearization summit with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un on Feb. 27 and 28, which ended abruptly when the two could not reach a deal. Other Gallup polling earlier in February found that Americans' perceptions of North Korea as the greatest enemy of the U.S. had plummeted in the past year.

As the summit with North Korea was taking place, Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, testified publicly in a congressional hearing which Trump has blamed, at least in part, for the failed denuclearization agreement. Cohen alleged that the president is a ""con man"" and a ""racist"" and shed doubt upon his campaign's relationship with Russia -- issues on which Trump earns his lowest approval ratings.

The president's approval ratings on a range of other issues are at or below 50%. These include national defense, relations with China, foreign trade, taxes, immigration, foreign affairs and the federal budget.

Sharp Partisan Differences in Views of Trump

Americans' views of Trump remain sharply polarized along partisan lines. Nine in 10 Republicans approve of the president's job overall and about as many or more approve of his handling the economy, national defense, unemployment, immigration, foreign affairs, the North Korean situation, relations with China and foreign trade.

Republicans' dimmest assessment of the president is for his handling of the Syria situation -- 71% approve, 18% disapprove and 12% have no opinion. Republican lawmakers have roundly criticized Trump's decisions about U.S. involvement in Syria since his announcement in December that he would abruptly withdraw all troops from the country. The Republican backlash and pleas from U.S. allies have slowed down that process, but last week Trump declared that all of the ISIS-controlled territory in Syria had been conquered, a claim disputed by many.

For their part, Democrats' approval of Trump's overall job is 6%, and their approval of his handling all 14 issues measured ranges from 5% to 21%. Democrats' highest approval ratings are 21% for unemployment, 20% for the economy and 17% for the situation with North Korea. Democrats give Trump his lowest ratings for handling relations with Russia, race relations, government corruption and foreign affairs, all garnering no more than 8% approval from Democrats.

Partisans' Approval Ratings of President Trump Republicans Independents Democrats % % % Overall job 90 35 6 The economy 93 53 20 National defense 91 48 14 Unemployment 90 56 21 Immigration 89 32 10 Foreign affairs 88 31 8 The situation with North Korea 88 46 17 Relations with China 88 42 14 Foreign trade 87 41 9 Taxes 86 43 10 The federal budget 82 35 9 Race relations 81 30 6 Relations with Russia 80 31 5 Corruption in government 79 27 7 The situation in Syria 71 29 9 GALLUP, Feb. 12-28, 2019

Independents' overall job approval rating of Trump is 35%, and their approval of him on the issues tested ranges from 27% for his handling of government corruption to 56% for unemployment.

Trump's Approval for the Economy Is Highest Yet

Americans' assessments of the national economy have been mostly positive since Trump took office and his handling of it has been a relative strength for his public image. With the unemployment rate at 4% in January and the stock market performing better than it had been in December and January, Americans' approval of Trump's handling of the economy rose four points since early February.

Gallup has asked Americans to assess presidents' handling of the economy with some regularity beginning with Reagan's presidency. Clinton had the record-high economic approval rating of 81% in 1999. The elder Bush had the record-low of 17% in 1992. The average rating is 43%, below both of Trump's February readings. In fact, Trump's approval on the economy has not fallen below 45% throughout his presidency.

Bottom Line

The president's greatest strength in the views of Americans remains his handling of the economy, although his overall approval rating lags far behind it. Americans' ratings of his handling of the economy and unemployment outpace 12 other issues tested in the latest Gallup poll, and at 56%, his rating on the economy is the highest of his presidency, up four percentage points from earlier this month.

Trump also enjoyed increased approval on the situation with North Korea in the latest poll, but the poll concluded just as the denuclearization talks ended without a signed agreement, and it is unclear what effect that will have on public evaluations in the coming weeks.

President Donald Trump is more than 19 months into an administration engulfed in so much controversy that it may overshadow a tremendous achievement, namely an economic boom uniquely his. During his time in office, the economy has achieved feats most experts thought impossible. GDP is growing at a 3 percent-plus rate. The unemployment rate is near a 50-year low. Meanwhile, the stock market has jumped 27 percent amid a surge in corporate profits. Friday brought another round of good news: Nonfarm payrolls rose by a better-than-expected 201,000 and wages, the last missing piece of the economic recovery, increased by 2.9 percent year over year to the highest level since April 2009. That made it the best gain since the recession ended in June 2009. His critics, a group that includes a legion of Wall Street economists, most Democrats and even some in his own Republican Party, don't believe it will last. They figure the current boom will begin petering out as soon as mid-2019 and possibly end in recession in 2020. But even they acknowledge that the current numbers are a uniquely Trumpian achievement and not owed to policies already set in motion when he took office. ""I still believe the big story this year is an economic boom that most folks thought impossible,"" Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council and a chief advisor to Trump, said in a recent interview with CNBC.com. ""I understand that he's been in for a year and a half, but when you look at those numbers, this is not going away."" Indeed, the economy does seem to be on fire, and it's fairly easy to draw a straight line from Trump's policies to the current trends.

Trump's economic achievements

Business confidence is soaring, in part thanks to a softer regulatory environment. Consumer sentiment by one measure is at its highest level in 18 years. Corporate profits, owed in good part to last year's tax cuts, are coming close to setting records. Each of those accomplishments can be tied either directly to new policies or at least indirectly through a brimming sense of hope from businesses that the White House is back on their side. ""When you look at those confidence indexes, they're telling you something,"" Kudlow said. ""His attitude is, we're not punishing business, we're not punishing success, we want to make things easier to do business and to hire, and I think it's had a very positive effect and a very palpable effect."" GDP most recently gained 4.2 percent in the second quarter, the best performance in nearly four years.

At the same time, the unemployment rate is 3.9 percent, just one-tenth of a percentage point above the lowest level since 1969. But there are some more telling figures about just how much progress has been made under Trump. At a time when most economists had been using the term ""full employment"" to describe the economy, 3.9 million more Americans have joined the ranks of the working during the Trump term. During the same period under former President Barack Obama, employment had fallen by 2.6 million. The economy in total, while still not in breakout mode, has grown by $1.4 trillion through the second quarter under Trump; the same time period for Obama saw a gain of just $481 billion, or a third of Trump's total. Businesses are investing, consumers are spending and innovation is on the rise as well.

Trump pledged that he would pare down regulations that were choking business activity. While the actual moves toward deregulation haven't been quite as ambitious as planned, the approach has won him converts in the business community. The most recent reading from the National Federation of Independent Business was the second highest in history dating back 45 years. Small business owners reported aggressive hiring plans, the only obstacle to which has been a dearth of labor supply. The end of June saw 6.7 million job openings and just 6.6 million Americans classified as unemployed, an unprecedented imbalance. ""Expansion continues to be a priority for small businesses who show no signs of slowing as they anticipate more sales and better business conditions."" NFIB President and CEO Juanita Duggan said in a statement.

How he did it

Trump's economic program was very simple: an attack on taxes and regulations with an extra dose of spending on infrastructure and the military that would create a supply shock to a moribund economy. On the tax side, the White House pushed through a massive $1.5 trillion reform plan that sliced the highest-in-the-world corporate tax from 35 percent to 21 percent and lowered rates for millions of taxpayers, though the cuts for individuals will expire in 2025. On deregulation, Trump ordered that rules be pared back or eliminated across the board. During his time in office, Congress has cut back on the Dodd-Frank banking reforms, particularly in areas affecting regional and community institutions, rolled back a multitude of environmental protections that he said were killing jobs and took a hatchet to dozens of other rules. (The left-leaning Brookings Institution think tank has a rolling deregulation tracker that can be viewed here.) During the first year of his administration, ""significant regulatory activity"" had declined 74 percent from where it was in the same period of the Obama administration, according to data collected by Bridget Dooling, research professor at GW's Regulatory Studies Center. The Dodd-Frank rollbacks have been particularly helpful to community banks, whose share prices collectively are up more than 25 percent over the past year. Small-cap stocks in general have strongly outperformed the broader market, gaining 23 percent over the past 12 months at a time when the S&P 500 is up 17 percent. The Federal Register, where business rules are stored and thus serves as a proxy for regulatory activity, was 19.2 percent smaller from Inauguration Day until Aug. 16 under Trump than during the same period for Obama. ""You can think of that as turning off the spigot of new regulations,"" Dooling said in an interview. She said more aggressive movement appears to be on the way. Dooling said recent regulatory changes from the Environmental Protection Agency and the departments of Education and Labor will advance deregulation in an even ""more meaningful way."" In addition to expected deregulation benefits, there's also anticipation that the true benefits of tax cuts have yet to kick in. that he attributes the bulk of new economic growth to deregulation rather than the tax cuts, whose benefits he expects to come later. ""It's still too early to tell. We haven't seen any of the multipliers yet from tax reform,"" said Jacob Oubina, senior U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets. ""We have enough in terms of ammunition to put in 3 percent growth for the rest of this year and even all of 2019, but we haven't seen sort of this spike in activity yet."" There's been another interesting trend that is peculiar to the Trump economy: a drifting of benefits from urban centers to nonmetropolitan areas, which are seeing their first collective population growth since 2010. Trump's tax cuts ""should deliver greater tax relief to rural areas where there is a higher rate of small business owners who will benefit from the favorable pass-through tax rates,"" Joseph Song, U.S. economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said in a recent note to clients.

Of course, it’s hard to see right now. His trade war with China notwithstanding, the economy seems to be the brightest star in the Trumpian universe. Despite the last few days, the stock market remains at all-time highs. Annualized G.D.P. is forecast to be a respectable 3.2 percent. The falling unemployment rate—which Trump derided as fake news until he took office—is at 3.6 percent, the lowest in nearly 50 years. Trump has even succeeded in jawboning Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, into backing off his plan to raise short-term interest rates. As a result, interest rates—which determine what it costs Americans to get a mortgage or a car loan—remain historically, and unnaturally, low. An economy this good, many Democrats worry, could even get Trump re-elected, insane as that might seem.

But the economic picture is more complicated. On the one hand, Trump can lay a legitimate claim to having once again unleashed the “animal spirits” across the land. He has greatly reduced corporate tax rates and regulations, giving businesses a much freer rein to do pretty much whatever they want in search of more and more profit. And he is doing his level best—and succeeding, at least temporarily—in keeping interest rates lower than they otherwise would be but for his ongoing meddling into the affairs of the Federal Reserve.

Ironically, the very actions that Trump has taken, and that he believes are responsible for supercharging the economy (which I must hasten to point out was already doing pretty well under Barack Obama), will come back to haunt him. There’s always a price to pay when capitalists are allowed to roam free without supervision. But the real problem for Trump will come from his Fed gambits. By keeping interest rates at artificially low levels for so long (it’s been nearly 11 years and counting), debt investors are on a worldwide hunt for higher yields—the so-called “yield-hunger games”—forcing them to overpay for bonds, loans, and other debt-like instruments, and to take higher and higher risk without getting properly compensated for them.

When the economy turns—and it will; it always does—investors will lose hundreds of billions of dollars as a result of mispricing risk. “At this point, there’s more actual risk exposure than Trump would have you believe,” says one senior Wall Street banker, a friend of mine. “The world is more leveraged than it has ever been before at the corporate level, at the sovereign level, and collectively at the consumer level.”

Wall Street has always been very good at providing investors with what they want. If they want higher-yielding bonds, loans, and debt securities, then that’s exactly what Wall Street will start manufacturing and selling. You will remember, no doubt, that’s exactly what happened more than a decade ago when Wall Street started manufacturing and selling mortgage-backed securities that promised higher yields for AAA-rated credits. Of course, that was a chimera. And it all ended very badly, in the worst financial crisis in memory.

Now, Wall Street is inventing a new generation of risky instruments, of which there are many, many examples. From loans issued without covenants, to risky loans packaged up as securities and sold around the world as good investments, to “junk bonds” that yield 6 percent when they should be yielding closer to 10 percent or more.

One such symptom of the current situation, which arrived in my inbox the other day: an offer for a so-called “structured investment,” courtesy of the geniuses at JPMorgan Chase. What they have successfully served up to investors, hungry for yield, is a six-month note that promises to pay investors annualized interest of 16 percent under certain circumstances. Those certain circumstances depend almost entirely—believe it or not—on the performance of G.E.’s stock. As long as G.E.’s stock stays within a certain range each month for six months—basically not falling more than 30 percent from roughly where it has been—then JPMorgan Chase will pay investors at least 1.333 percent per month interest on their investment, or 8 percent for six months, or an annualized rate of 16 percent.

Given that six-month Treasury bills are now yielding around 2.4 percent, an investment that yields 8 percent for the same time period begins to look pretty damn good. Sure, there’s risk—if G.E.’s stock falls out of the range, the investor can lose his money; the note is callable if G.E. stock rises above the range. There is some small risk that JPMorgan Chase goes out of business and can’t pay off the note (think Lehman Brothers, circa September 2008)—but probably not enough to dissuade investors from the chance of getting that 8-percent yield for six months. It’s a way for investors to bet on the performance of G.E. stock, without having to buy or sell G.E. stock—while getting some protection if G.E. stock falls, but not too much, in the next six months. It’s all a bit wacky, with a twist of genius. Some investors think these kinds of “structured investments” are daft. One, Russell Clark, a London-based hedge-fund manager, has plowed much of his approximately $650 million fund into a massive bet that the market for these kinds of investments will come a cropper. It’s “unsustainable,” he told Bloomberg News recently, “and will end badly. I’ve seen it twice, three times even. And it feels so close to that inflection point. Everyone’s in the same trade.”","(0, 'GDP')"

“We have the best economy the country's ever had and it's getting better.”

— Trump, in an interview with the Daily Caller, Sept. 3

It started, as so many things do, with a tweet.

Now, in 40 different venues over three months, according to our database of false and misleading claims, President Trump has declared that the economy is the greatest, the best or the strongest in U.S. history. That’s a rate of every two days. In some cases, such as the rally in West Virginia — a rally, that like all of his campaign rallies was aired without interruption on Fox News — he repeated the statement as many as four times.

This type of presidential braggadocio leaves us with a conundrum. One could dismiss it a merely overheated rhetoric, as one historian suggested to The Fact Checker. (Another joked, “you should put these questions to a rabbi, not an economic historian.”) But is there a point at which the statement becomes its own form of truth through consistent repetition? The president has said it so often that by the end of the three-month period, he even quoted himself: ""It's said now that our economy is the strongest it's ever been in the history of our country.”

So it appears we must delve into this issue.

The Facts

The president is an avid watcher of Fox News, and good economic news is regularly touted on programs hosted by some of his favorites, such as Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs.

“The Trump economy remains red-hot, stocks hitting new highs today. Consumer confidence soaring to levels not seen in nearly two decades,” Dobbs announced Aug. 28. A day earlier, Dobbs echoed another favorite talking point of the president. “He campaigned, remember, for minority votes, asking what have you got to lose? Everyone now is winning with this president. ... He's done more for the minorities in this country than any president in frankly decades.”

Interestingly, though, a review of transcripts over the past three months finds that neither Hannity nor Dobbs would go so far as to echo the president’s line about this being the greatest economy in U.S. history. On July 31, Hannity came the closest, but with an important caveat: “This is the single greatest economy that we have had in 10 years.”

There's little argument about that. Ten years ago, the United States was in the midst of the Great Recession, which ended in June 2009.

The economy certainly is pretty strong right now, with the unemployment rate low and stock market indices at record highs. We will lay aside the issue of whether Trump can claim credit for the state of the economy because of his tax bill and deregulatory efforts, or whether he merely inherited a winning hand from President Barack Obama. We will keep our focus on whether it is indeed the strongest in U.S. history.

There are several metrics one could look at — and which the president has mentioned at times — but the current economy falls short, according to experts.

Unemployment rate. The unemployment rate in August was 3.9 percent, and it dipped as low as 3.8 percent in May. But the unemployment rate was as low as 2.5 percent in 1953. In fact, it was below 3.9 percent for much of 1951, 1952 and 1953. The unemployment rate was as low as 3.4 percent in 1968 and 1969 and was 3.8 percent in 2000.

Still, jobless claims, a more volatile figure, fell at the end of August to the lowest level since 1969.

When Trump campaigned for president, he used to twist the labor force participation rate in a misleading example of a flagging economy. But the labor force participation rate has not greatly improved under Trump. The retirement of the baby-boom generation is a major factor. Moreover, the labor force participation rate for men of prime working age (25 to 54) has remained stuck at about 88.9 percent, compared with 97 percent in the 1950s and 1960s.

Gross Domestic Product. This is another statistic Trump often cites. The GDP is the broadest measure of the economy. and during the campaign he promised to achieve an annual growth rate of 4 percent. In the second quarter, the rate was 4.2 percent, but that’s still below the 5.1 percent and 4.9 percent achieved in two quarters in 2014, or the 4.7 percent increase in a quarter in 2011.

It may be a stretch to achieve an annual growth rate of 3 percent for all of 2018; in 2017, growth was 2.3 percent. In 1997, 1998 and 1999, the GDP grew 4.5 percent, 4.5 percent and 4.7 percent, respectively. But even that period paled against the 1950s and 1960s. Growth between 1962 and 1966 ranged from 4.4 percent to 6.6 percent. In 1950 and 1951, it was 8.7 and 8 percent, respectively, and then was 4.1 and 4.7 percent in 1952 and 1953.

Economic historians pointed to these data points to say the president’s claim is off base.

“He is completely wrong. Growth was much higher in the early 1960s at close to 5 percent per year and unemployment was below 3 percent,” said Michael D. Bordo, director of the Center for Monetary and Financial History at Rutgers University, adding that the tech boom in the 1990s was also a period of rapid growth. He said even higher economic growth was probably achieved in the 1870s, when Ulysses S. Grant was president.

“Real GDP growth was faster in the ’50s and ’60s,"" said Robert J Gordon of Northwestern University. “Most important, real income growth was equally rapid across the bottom and top of the income distribution between 1947 and 1980, while from 1980 to 2017 it has been heavily concentrated at the top. “ He added that “wages are still stagnating, average hourly earnings [growth] of 2.8 over last year is about the same as the consumer price index, so real wages haven’t grown at all. That’s very different than the period before 2007 and particularly the years before 1973.”

Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College professor who wrote a history of trade policy, said that although the economy is not growing as fast as in some previous periods, “the economy is doing pretty darn good by historical standards.” He noted that real per capita income is at an all-time high. While the trend line in the United States has generally been up, except in recessions, he said that is a “remarkable feature"" of the U.S. economy that few other countries have matched.

Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation and author of “The Past and Future of America’s Economy: Long Waves of Innovation That Power Cycles of Growth,” said the GDP is not a valid measure of “the strongest economy” in the first place.

“It’s a bit like looking at the best-selling movie’s box office receipts,” he said. “It’s easiest to be the top-grossing movie today because there are more people in the U.S. than ever before and ticket prices are highest, because of inflation.”

Atkinson said a better measure is growth in productivity — the output per hour of work. “By this measure, the economy under President Trump is actually performing very poorly, compared to postwar figures,” he said. “In the six quarters since the president was elected, business labor productivity grew 1.4 percent per year, compared to periods in the 1960s and the period between 1996 and 2004 where it grew approximately two to 2.5 times faster.”

The Pinocchio Test

The president can certainly brag about the state of the economy, but he runs into trouble when he repeatedly makes a play for the history books. By just about any important measure, the economy today is not doing as well as it did under Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson and Bill Clinton — and Ulysses S. Grant.

The odd thing is that Trump does not need to claim that the economy is the greatest ever. He just needs to say it’s doing great. He should take a cue from his fans at Fox News and not push the envelope so much. Who knows? He may someday have bragging rights. In the meantime, he earns Three Pinocchios.

Weeks later, in his first speech to a joint session of Congress, Trump continued the theme, complaining that “we have the worst financial recovery in 65 years” while “our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion.”

A year later, we can expect a very different message in Tuesday’s State of the Union speech. Trump has become a relentless cheerleader for the American economy, touting the low unemployment rate, steady job growth, and record stock market peaks that have occurred during his brief presidency.

Wonks will debate how much credit he really deserves, personally, for any of this. (Foreign markets have soared too, and several are also at all-time highs.) But the fact is that his words will resonate today just as his bleak view resonated in 2016, even with many people who ultimately didn’t vote for him. Gallup found in early January that Americans’ confidence in the economy soared 16 points during Trump’s first year in office, reaching positive territory for the first time since Gallup began tracking it in 2008.

But this transformation in perceptions is out of step with the underlying reality. The basic truth is that while the economy displayed steady growth over the past 12 months, the same was true of the 72 months or so that came before that. The big change hasn’t been in the economy but in people’s hearts — Republican Party loyalists, in particular, weren’t ready to admit the economy had recovered until they had a co-partisan in the White House.

The partially partisan economy

Two polls from Gallup tell the tale.

The first, comparing annual averages, shows that Democrats and Republicans have reacted very differently to Trump’s ascent, with Republicans becoming more positive about the economy and Democrats less so.

That perceptions of the economy would be mediated by partisanship is perhaps to be expected. But Trump’s key achievement here is that while both Democrats and Republicans have changed their minds about the economy, Republicans have responded more sharply. They’ve nearly uniformly developed positive views about the economy due to Trump, while many Democrats also hold positive views about the economy and likely simply give former President Barack Obama the credit for it.

Even more strikingly, Gallup’s weekly numbers show that the Republican turnaround in perceptions largely happened before Trump even took office.

It wasn’t, in other words, that something changed in the economy, Republicans gave Trump credit for it and then decided to start praising the economy. The mere fact that Trump had won the election made Democrats feel somewhat worse about economic conditions and Republicans feel a lot better.

Actual economic conditions, meanwhile, really have improved — but only at a modest pace that is entirely continuous with previous trends.

The economy just isn’t that different

The American economy as of last fall certainly had its share of problems — problems that Trump wasn’t shy about pointing out. The trouble is that, as Michael Grunwald wrote recently, none of the dark linings in the silver cloud of the Obama economy have changed under Trump:

In fact, by the standards Trump used to trash the Obama era in his speech to Congress, the Trump era has been another economic nightmare. “Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force!” he complained last year. That was true at the time, if you included students, retirees and the disabled, but today, 95.5 million Americans are out of the labor force. “Over 43 million Americans are on food stamps,” Trump said last year. This year, it’s still over 42 million. “Our trade deficit in goods last year was nearly $800 billion!” Trump marveled. Under Trump, the trade deficit is increasing.

Trump has addressed this largely by changing the criteria by which he evaluates the economy. No longer does a healthy America require closing the trade deficit, drastically increasing the labor force participation rate despite an aging population, or making the labor market so robust nobody needs social assistance. Instead, Trump points to record-low black unemployment and a record-high stock market.

But the stock market first hit record high territories under Obama, and Trump-era market performance has actually lagged its Obama-era average. A simple eyeball of the African-American unemployment rate, meanwhile, makes it clear that Trump has nothing to do with this trend.

More broadly, whether you want to characterize current economic trends as fantastic or terrible (I prefer, “They’re okay”), they simply aren’t very different from the trends we saw under Obama. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the economy grew 2.5 percent relative to where it had been a year ago. That’s better than what we saw in 2016 or 2015 but worse than what we got in 2014 and 2013. It’s also considerably lower than the 3 percent average annual growth he promised in his official budget submission, which in turn was lower than the 4 percent average annual growth he touted on the campaign trail. It’s also slightly worse than Canada or Mexico did last year.

Perhaps the clearest indication that we’re looking at a continuity recovery is a glance at annual job growth, which was decent under Trump but reflected an ongoing slowdown rather than an acceleration.

That’s not Trump’s fault.

Job growth slowed in 2017 for the same reason it slowed in 2016 — the closer we get to a full-employment economy, the fewer unemployed workers there are out there to easily rehire. But if Trump had actually delivered some kind of game-changing supply-side transformation of the American economy, he wouldn’t be stuck with that slowdown. He’s presiding over the same “steady as she goes” demand-side recovery that Obama had for his second term, and that should really be no surprise, since the Federal Reserve has remained in the same hands.

The stock boom is real — and great for globalist elites

The biggest exception to the case for continuity here is probably the stock market.

It’s true that shares soared on Obama’s watch, but that’s in part because he took over in the aftermath of a gigantic crash. Trump won the election at a time when stock market valuations were already high, and watched markets soar during the lame-duck months; they’ve only gone up since then. This market euphoria really is different from what we saw prior to 2017, and it may suggest something significant.

Exactly what that might be isn’t entirely clear. The 2017 stock market boom was a fully global phenomenon. It was actually Argentina whose exchange posted the highest gains, and the US stock market has slightly underperformed Japan’s Nikkei 225 index since Trump’s inauguration. The Hong Kong stock exchange is at an all-time high, as are the major indexes of India, South Korea, Germany, and a range of other countries.

Meanwhile, Robert Shiller, the Yale economist who’s spent a lifetime studying asset price bubbles, reports that American shares are the most expensive in the world relative to underlying corporate earnings. That could mean our stock market is massively overvalued, or it could reflect expectations that a pro-business regime in Washington is going to find a way to tilt the playing field even more strongly in favor of shareholders over workers and consumers.

In his inaugural address, Trump promised to champion the little guy, saying “the forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.”

The reality of the stock market boom, however, is that it means an explosion of inequality. Economist Edward Wolff has calculated that nearly 40 percent of the market is owned by the richest 1 percent of the population, with the next 9 percent accounting for a bit more than 40 percent. The bottom 90 percent of the population owns just 19 percent of stock market wealth.

None of which is to say that a booming stock market is bad, only that it doesn’t do much to concretely impact the life of the average person or contradict the basic reality that labor market and GDP growth data show broad continuity with the Obama era.

Is America great now?

Hillary Clinton struggled to articulate a boosterish case for the American economy during the 2016 campaign in part because of lingering patches of labor market weakness but largely because progressives have a more fundamental critique of the US economic situation.

The United States is the only high-income country to have millions of citizens who lack health insurance, has a relative child poverty rate that’s off the charts by the standards of other developed countries, has no guaranteed paid parental leave or paid vacation, and remains one of the world’s highest per capita emitters of greenhouse gases even as the world hurtles toward an environmental crisis. Under those circumstances, efforts to pitch the notion that “America is already great” end up falling flat not just — or even especially — with skeptical swing voters but with Democrats’ own base that yearns for transformative change to aspects of the American welfare state and of American political economy.

Republicans have no such qualms. The Republican Party donor class is very, very excited about high stock market valuations (which lead directly to huge payouts for top executives) and about corporate income tax cuts (which lead to high stock market valuations, and thus huge payouts for top executives) and thus are very glad to embrace the narrative that all is now well with the American economy. That gives an incumbent Republican presiding over decent growth an easy, uncomplicated pitch to make — things are good now, and they are good thanks to me.

It’s largely forgotten now, but back during the mid-aughts (a time of more rapid wage growth than what we saw in 2017, incidentally), it was commonplace in conservative circles to proclaim that we were living through a “Bush Boom” touched off by his game-changing tax cuts and deregulation. That story, obviously, eventually ended in tears, as a poorly supervised financial system channeled inequitably shared growth into an unsustainable pyramid of debt that eventually collapsed. But they were good times while they lasted.

Perhaps this time it will be different.","(4, 'national debt')"

""When you hear how great the economy's doing right now, let's just remember when this recovery started,” Obama said on Friday in a speech that marked his first foray into the upcoming elections. ""I mean, I'm glad it's continued, but when you hear about this economic miracle that's been going on, when the job numbers come out, monthly job numbers, suddenly Republicans are saying it's a miracle. I have to kind of remind them, actually, those job numbers are the same as they were in 2015 and 2016.""

Trump disparaged the speech, at one point saying he fell asleep during it.

“If the Democrats got in with their agenda in November of almost two years ago, instead of having 4.2 up, I believe honestly you'd have 4.2 down,” Trump said Friday night, speaking of GDP growth. “It was the weakest recovery in the history of our country since, I guess, to be totally specific, because I'm not sure they've gone any further, since the Great Depression.”

“The Economy is soooo good, perhaps the best in our country’s history,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Monday.

Earlier this summer, he stood on the South Lawn of the White House and boasted about achieving a ""turnaround of historic proportions"" — an ""economic miracle.""

The Economy is soooo good, perhaps the best in our country’s history (remember, it’s the economy stupid!), that the Democrats are flailing & lying like CRAZY! Phony books, articles and T.V. “hits” like no other pol has had to endure-and they are losing big. Very dishonest people! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 10, 2018

The economy's success or failure depends on much more than who sits in the Oval Office, but let's take a look at the facts here.

Was the economy struggling when Trump took office?

Absolutely not. Trump inherited a booming economy with low unemployment and steady job growth — an easy win on day one — and he quickly claimed credit. Early in his presidency, Trump boasted about job gains starting from his election onward, crediting Obama's final months as his own.

It is extremely unlikely that the GDP could ever have been negative 4.2 percent no matter who was elected in 2016. At the height of the 2009 recession, GDP was at -2.5 percent. It has not been at or above -4.2 percent in 86 years.

The economy was, however, struggling when Obama took office in 2009. He inherited a dismal economy in the middle of a recession that lasted 18 months, facing what many feared would be a depression, and was able to turn it around in the first years of his presidency. The U.S. is now its 10th year of economic growth, and in its longest period of growth with 95 straight months of job creation. The bulk of that decade of growth was under Obama’s presidency, and can fairly be credited to him.

Still, as Trump accurately points out, the recovery under Obama was marked by a slower rate of growth than what followed previous recessions, such as the recovery under President Ronald Reagan in 1983 and 1984.

But, what about the Trump effect?

Trump's supporters say he's supercharged the economy. Now in the second year of his presidency, he has passed a major tax bill and rolled back a significant number of regulations, giving the economy another injection of capital — though economists disagree on the how much the tax cuts will really benefit the larger economy and whether it will have lasting effects to the economy.

Trump has surely seen some impressive data points in his first term: GDP growth has reached 4.2 percent, unemployment has reached its lowest point in half a century, and the stock market has reached new heights.

The president and his administration have been eager to tout the numbers. Kevin Hassett, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, kicked off the White House press briefing on Monday with a slew of charts. He said the growth is not an extension of a trend, but rather a ""clear upward trajectory, way above the trend.""

Economists aren't buying it: While the tax cuts probably helped inject some cash into the economy — particularly the stock market — the country has largely maintained the growth it saw under Obama.

The numbers Hassett touted, economists said, were cherrypicked to show a trend that economists say they're just not seeing.

""The entire story of claiming some major change in economic activity doesn’t ring true,"" said Harvard economist Benjamin Friedman. ""I think there’s really very little to point to, and you’d have tell some story based on stock market. Any time the story hinges on the stock market, that means an economist is going to be very much on weak ground.""

Hassett did correct Trump, who tweeted Monday morning that ""the GDP Rate (4.2%) is higher than the Unemployment Rate (3.9%) for the first time in over 100 years!""

Multiple news organizations had fact checked the president's statement earlier in the day, and found ""100 years"" to be false. This type of relationship between the GDP and the unemployment rate had not happened in 10 years, Hassett confirmed in response to a question from a reporter.

""You'd have to talk to the president about where the number came from, but the correct number is 10 years,"" Hassett said. Trump has yet to correct his tweet.

Still, it's impossible to tease out Trump's economy from Obama's this early in the former's presidency. GDP last reached 4.2 percent during Obama's second term. And where workers are concerned, Trump's gains do not yet match his predecessor's. Since Trump took office, the country has added 3.58 million jobs, short of the 3.96 million jobs that were added in the final 19 months of Obama's presidency.

Economies do not grow overnight, or turn on a hair with a new presidency. While Obama can look back on his eight years and see his leadership play out, Trump's effect is still not yet known.

""In my view, the [Trump] effects are going to be much longer term — we shouldn't be looking at these indicators right now, which is just kind of a continuation,"" Harvard economist Marc Melitz said, citing tariffs and renegotiated trade deals as a top concern down the line. ""It’s going to generate a lot of instability. Already you can see some of it in terms of higher prices for a lot of materials in the U.S.""

Trump has previously said that the U.S. is enjoying the best economy in America’s history — a claim other fact checkers have ruled to be false.

But it certainly is one of the best, as Trump tweeted today — thanks in large part to Obama.","(0, 'GDP')"
310,1. Views of Trump - Pew Research Center,1. Views of Trump  Pew Research Center,"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBld3Jlc2VhcmNoLm9yZy9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDE5LzAxLzE4LzEtdmlld3Mtb2YtdHJ1bXAtMi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Pew Research Center,"The public’s confidence in Trump to handle a number of key issues remains mixed. Trump fares best on issues related to economic conditions, where about half of Americans say they are at least somewhat confident in his ability. By contrast, only about a third express confidence in his ability to work effectively with Congress.

Overall, 62% say they are not too or not at all confident in Trump’s ability to work effectively with Congress; far fewer (35%) say they are very or somewhat confident in him to do this.

When it comes to making wise decisions about immigration policy, four-in-ten say they are at least somewhat confident in Trump (including 29% who say they are very confident). Nearly six-in-ten (58%) express little or no confidence in Trump on immigration policy, including 45% who say they are not at all confident in him on this issue.

Narrow majorities also say they have little or no confidence in Trump to use military force wisely, handle an international crisis or manage the executive branch effectively. About half (51%) say they are not too or not at all confident that Trump can make good appointments to the federal courts, while 45% say they are at least somewhat confident in him in this area.

Trump garners the most confidence in his ability to negotiate favorable trade agreements with other countries (51% say they are at least somewhat confident) and to make good decisions about economic policy (49%). Still, close to half the public says they lack confidence in Trump to handle these two issue areas.

Nearly nine-in-ten Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (89%) are confident in Trump’s ability to negotiate favorable trade agreements with other countries, compared with just 19% of Democrats and Democratic leaners.

The pattern is similar on most other issues. For instance, 89% of Republicans – and only 17% of Democrats – are very or somewhat confident in Trump to make good decisions about economic policy.

Trump gets his lowest ratings from Republicans on his ability to work effectively with Congress: Seven-in-ten say they are at least somewhat confident in his ability to do this, but just 31% say they are very confident. Across all other issues, at least 50% of Republicans say they are very confident in Trump.

Broad concern over possible influence of Trump’s business interests

Only about three-in-ten Americans (28%) are very confident that Trump keeps his own business interests separate from the decisions he makes as president, and another 13% say they are somewhat confident in this. A majority are either not too (16%) or not at all (41%) confident that Trump is keeping his own personal interests separate from his presidential decisions.

Most Republicans say they are very (55%) or somewhat (23%) confident that Trump keeps his business interests separate from his decision-making as president. Conservative Republicans are much more likely to say they are very confident in this (66%) than are moderate and liberal Republicans (39%).

Democrats are deeply skeptical that Trump is avoiding potential conflicts of interest. Nearly seven-in-ten (69%) say that they are not at all confident that Trump keeps his business interests and his presidential decisions separate, while another 20% say they are not too confident in this. Liberal Democrats are particularly skeptical: Fully 83% say they are not at all confident in Trump to keep his business interests separate.

Most say Trump should release tax returns

In surveys over the past two years, a majority of Americans have said that Trump has a responsibility to release his tax returns. Currently, 64% say he has this responsibility, slightly higher than the share who said this last year. About a third of the public (32%) says he does not have this responsibility.

Fully 91% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say that Trump has a responsibility to publicly release his tax returns, up from about eight-in-ten who said this in both January 2018 (80%) and January 2017 (79%).

By contrast, most Republicans continue to say that Trump does not have a responsibility to release his tax returns: Just 32% say he has this responsibility, while 64% say he does not.

Trump’s statements less trusted than those of previous presidents

A majority of the public (58%) says they trust what Trump says less than they trusted what previous presidents said while in office. Just 26% say they trust Trump more than previous presidents, while 14% say their level of trust in Trump’s rhetoric is about the same as for past presidents.

Distrust in Trump compared with other presidents has increased since April of 2017, when a somewhat smaller share (51%) said they trusted what Trump says less than previous presidents.

Almost all Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (94%) say they trust what Trump says less than they trusted what previous presidents said while in office.

Among Republicans and Republican leaners, most (58%) say they trust what Trump says more than previous presidents, while 25% say they trust what he says about the same as previous presidents; 15% say they trust his rhetoric less.

Low marks for ethical standards of top administration officials

Views of the ethical standards of top Trump administration officials remain at record lows compared with previous administrations dating back to the 1980s.

Overall, 39% rate the ethical standards of top Trump administration officials as either excellent (7%) or good (32%). A much greater share describes them as either not good (20%) or poor (39%). These ratings are about the same as they were in May 2018.

Views of Trump administration officials are lower than those of officials in the previous five administrations, often measured at times of specific ethical controversies.

Partisans remain deeply divided on this question, with 76% of Republicans and Republican leaners saying that ethical standards of top administration officials are excellent or good (although only 16% say they are “excellent”), and 90% of Democrats and Democratic leaners saying that ethical standards of top Trump administration officials are not good or poor (with 67% saying they are “poor”).

Trump’s impact on economy seen as positive, on balance

While the public is critical of Trump and his administration in multiple areas, they see Trump’s impact on the economy in a positive light. Overall, 40% think that Trump’s policies have made economic conditions better since taking office, compared with fewer (28%) who say they have made conditions worse; 29% say they have not had much of an effect.

Since October 2017, the share saying Trump’s economic policies have not had much of an effect has declined 20 points. There have been comparable increases in the shares who say his policies have made things better (+11 points) and worse (+10 points).

Partisan views of Trump’s economic policies have become more polarized since the fall of 2017. Nearly eight-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners (79%) say that his economic policies had improved conditions in the country (up from 63% in October 2017). Democrats and Democratic leaners, by contrast, have grown more negative in their views of Trump’s economic policies. Almost half (46%) of Democrats now say his policies have made the economy worse, up from 28% in October 2017.

How will Trump’s presidency be viewed in the long run?

When asked if they think Donald Trump will be a successful or unsuccessful president in the long run, 47% say he will be unsuccessful, while about three-in-ten (29%) say he will be successful; 23% say it is too early to tell whether Trump will be successful or unsuccessful. Since last year, the share saying Trump will be successful and the share saying he will be unsuccessful have both increased by 6 percentage points.

The share who say it is too early to tell if Trump will be successful is much lower than at comparable points for previous presidents. At the start of Barack Obama’s third year in office, nearly half of the public (47%) said it was too early to tell whether he would be successful; 38% said this about George W. Bush and 43% about Clinton at comparable points.

The nearly half of Americans (47%) who now say Trump will be unsuccessful is far higher than the share who said this about his three most recent predecessors at comparable points in their first term.

About two-thirds of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (65%) say Trump will be a successful president in the long run.

An even larger share of Democrats and Democratic leaners (80%) think that Trump will be an unsuccessful president.

Republicans are slightly more likely than Democrats to say it is too early to tell whether Trump will be successful (25% vs. 16%).

In January 2011, about half of Republicans (47%) said Obama would be unsuccessful, while nearly as many (45%) said it was too early to tell. Among Democrats, 43% said Obama would be successful and 47% said it was too early to tell.

Republicans’ views of Trump’s long-term outlook are similar to how they viewed Bush in his third year. In December 2003, 69% of Republicans thought Bush would be successful; just 28% said it was too early to tell. Democrats’ views of Bush were not as fully established: 37% thought he would be unsuccessful, while 43% said it was too early to tell.

Views of Mueller investigation

Overall, 55% of the public says they are very or somewhat confident that Robert Mueller is conducting a fair investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election. A smaller share (41%) says they are not too or not at all confident in Mueller.

There is less public confidence in Trump to appropriately handle matters related to the special counsel’s investigation. Just 37% are very or somewhat confident in Trump to handle matters related to the investigation appropriately, compared with 60% who say they are not too or not at all confident in Trump to do this.

Views of the Mueller investigation – and Trump’s handling of the matter – remain deeply partisan.

About seven-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners (72%) are at least somewhat confident in the fairness of Mueller’s investigation. Among Republicans and Republican leaners, a larger share says they are not too or not at all confident in Mueller (58%) than says they are very or somewhat confident in him (39%).

When it comes to Trump’s handling of matters related to the investigation, fully 92% of Democrats express a lack of confidence in Trump, including 70% who say they are not at all confident in him. Three-quarters of Republicans say they are confident in Trump to handle the inquiry appropriately, including 42% who say they are very confident.

Confidence in the Mueller investigation has not changed much over the course of the past year. In January and September of 2018, an identical 55% said they were at least somewhat confident that Mueller was conducting a fair investigation in to Russian involvement in the 2016 election.","(4, 'national debt')"

Despite his free market ideology, President Reagan imposed quotas on auto imports from Japan to protect the U.S. industry in the 1980s. Japanese companies responded by jumping over the barrier and bringing best-practice manufacturing facilities to the U.S. market. The trade barrier did not stop American consumers from buying Japanese cars. Today, companies that want to avoid the new tariffs on washing machines or solar panels can expand operations here. Trump is not motivated by trade theory, of course, but by the political advantage that comes from blaming trade for the decline in blue collar jobs. Trump’s trade policies may damage our trading partners, like Mexico or Canada, and they have undermined the standing of the U.S. in the world, but they will have little impact on U.S. growth either way. That said, China has a lot of economic weapons, and entering a trade war with China would be very damaging, indeed. Fortunately, the president seems to have walked back from such a conflict.

Unlike the tax bill, the Trump Administration’s policies on trade and immigration are a break with Republican tradition. Traditionally, Democrats have been much more ambivalent about trade agreements than Republicans because of the opposition of labor leaders, although in the end Democratic presidents have supported them. Like most economists, I support freer trade because it allows the United States to specialize in the parts of the economy where it is most productive. Some workers and companies are hurt by trade, but overall free trade is good for U.S. growth.

More recently, the decline has been in high-tech and high-growth entrepreneurial companies and the reason for that decline remains a puzzle. 3 Since the Great Recession, a lack of financing may have contributed to the problem. Before the Great Recession, new companies could get started by using the equity in the homes of the founders. Home prices have recovered but there is still not the same ready supply of home equity and startups have to find other sources of cash. It was too easy to get a loan in the first years of this century, while today it may be too hard. Easing lending restrictions too much would increase the chances of another crisis, but that is unlikely to happen in the next few years. I would expect that general business optimism plus easier lending rules will help the small business community and add to economic growth, although not by a lot.

Small Business Lending. Small and medium sized businesses were hit hard during the recession and were slow to recover. As the economy has strengthened, this sector of the economy is doing better, but is still behind. The number of startup companies has been in decline for decades and the reasons are not fully understood. In earlier decades, the decline simply reflected changing technology. Many new businesses were in retail or restaurants and the expansion of large retailers and chain restaurants drove out the small startups.

This administration has opened up additional land for drilling and eliminated restrictions on the burning of coal. Are these changes going to solve a pressing problem in the economy? U.S. energy production has been soaring as a result of new technologies. Oil production is moving above 10 million barrels a day and natural gas is very cheap and abundant. Renewable energy sources have now become price competitive with fossil fuels. In the end, the deregulation of energy under this administration is symbolic and will have very little consequence for near term growth. Given this, it seems a mistake to abandon efforts to scale back harmful emissions.

The new administrator of the EPA is opposed to most regulations and argues that global warming may be a good thing. 2 The administration is moving to eliminate restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions. EPA does not control state laws, but under the Trump regime it will be easier and cheaper for companies to resolve environmental concerns—at the price of more pollution.

Environmental and Energy Regulation. The regulatory environment in the U.S. has become very cumbersome. Multiple federal, state and local agencies may have to agree on permits and the legal system can drag out final approval for investments and expansions. The Obama Administration worked to streamline the approval process, but remained very supportive of cleaning up the environment.

In meetings with business groups attended in recent years, I found the hostility towards the Obama administration startling. While many in the business community recognize problems with Trump, they see him as a fellow businessperson who is on their side and believe he will be able to spur faster growth. That optimism may be enough to kick off stronger investment and business expansion.

Perhaps the impact of the Trump policies are being understated by these technical analyses. Trump has been able to transform the mood of American business. Corporate leaders said Obama did not understand how business operates, blamed them for the economy’s problems and did not appreciate that they need to do well if the economy is to do well.

Estimates of the impact of the tax act on long run growth vary a lot, but analyses that look at the overall impact of all provisions have results that center around growth rate increases of 0.06 to 0.09 percent a year over a decade. 1 The economic incentives built into the tax plan have a very small impact on growth, according to these estimates.

At the same time, the corporate income tax was full of distortions and had a marginal tax rate higher than most other advanced economies. There has been a case for corporate tax reform, which should mean eliminating deductions and tax breaks and using the revenue gained to lower the tax rate. That is hard to do politically because the companies that lose tax breaks fight to keep them. With some important exceptions, the administration’s tax bill took the easy way out, leaving most tax breaks unchanged and then cutting the statutory tax rate and reducing the taxation of foreign profits.

The centerpiece of the administration’s growth program is the tax cut bill that reduced the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. On its face, a policy to reduce taxation of corporations is a solution in search of a problem. Corporate profits have been booming since the end of the recession and the share of profits in national income has risen. Not all companies and not all industries are doing well but, on average, U.S. corporations have lots of cash on-hand. If they want to expand and invest more, they have the resources to do it. Few companies paid the full amount of the statutory tax rate because of a variety of tax breaks put into the law over the years. The tax on corporate profits has been a smaller share of GDP in the U.S. than the average for OECD countries.

In 2017, the stock market was strong, employment gains were solid, and GDP growth was a bit faster than in the past few years at 2.5 percent. In 2018, so far, employment and GDP growth have continued to look solid, but the stock market has become very volatile, triggered by fears of inflation and higher interest rates. This is a good time to assess the Trump economic program and whether it will actually improve U.S. economic growth to the degree the president claims it will.

President Trump and his economic team have made big promises about boosting future economic growth. Though official budget estimates assume growth will rise to 3 percent a year, the president suggests growth could be much faster. What policies have been implemented to justify these claims? The Administration has acted quickly on regulation, scaling back environmental rules and allowing more drilling. With new financial regulators in place, there has been some easing of bank rules, although no big changes. And, of course, just before the end of 2017, a tax bill was passed that lowered corporate taxes substantially and lowered individual taxes for some.

Immigration restrictions may have large effects. Trump proposes cutting legal immigration and closing the border in an effort to eliminate illegal immigration. The Pew Research Center estimates that the working age population in the United States will actually start to decline in the absence of immigrants,4 so there could be a significant decline in labor force growth and hence in the overall economic growth rate if there are drastic cuts in the number of immigrants.

Immigrants have been important in startup companies, especially technology companies. Silicon Valley was in part a creation of immigrants. Hostility towards immigrants will discourage smart and talented people from coming to the U.S. and undermine growth over the long run. It is hard to put a number on the impact, but it could be considerable.

Infrastructure

Trump campaigned on a pledge to introduce a large program of infrastructure investment. Specifics are now emerging and the proposed federal funding contribution is $200 billion over ten years. There is no question that America needs to upgrade its infrastructure. Roads, bridges, ports, the electricity grid, the water supply and other areas are in need of help. In the administration’s plan, the $200 billion would be leveraged into $1.5 trillion through private, state and local funding. The federal funds would be divided into $20 billion for projects of “national significance,” $50 billion for rural block grants and the rest would go for loan support or other likely high-leverage. The administration also wants to shorten the time for permitting and approvals.

It would certainly be helpful to speed up the permitting process and shorten litigation delays, but that will be tough to do, in practice, because many of the regulations are state laws.

And while taking $200 billion and multiplying it up to $1.5 trillion will be a pretty neat trick, it’s worth noting that the $200 billion is not a net addition to federal support. Some of that money is simply moved around from existing funding. It’s a stretch to think that the administration’s infrastructure initiative will have a significant positive impact on U.S. growth.

Barriers to faster growth: demand and supply

It is unusual to enact a large deficit-financed fiscal expansion when the economy is already at full-employment, but full employment does not mean the economy will hit a wall when it is given a demand boost. The fiscal stimulus will almost certainly increase growth in 2018 and 2019. There are advantages to a high-pressure economy where employers are fighting for workers and are even willing to hire unskilled workers and train them. Workers did well in the high-pressure economy of the late 1960s and again in the late 1990s.

The snag, of course, is that a high pressure economy may turn into an inflationary economy and the Federal Reserve is charged with barring the door against that possibility. Following the tight economy of the 1960s there was an inflation problem that lasted for 15 years. Following the tight economy of the 1990s, though, there has been no inflation problem, in fact the Federal Reserve has had trouble getting inflation up to its target of 2 percent. Monetarist economists who predicted runaway inflation from the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing policy have fallen on their faces as inflation has stayed low or even fallen. Believers in the Phillips curve tradeoff between inflation and unemployment have done better, but not much better.

At times recently it has seemed that the determinants of inflation are a mystery—but really they are not a complete mystery. The rise of China and the Asian supply chain held down prices of manufactured goods. The expansion of the supply of commodities has eased pressure on the prices of oil, metals and food. Prolonged recession in Europe and Japan and slowing growth in China eased demand globally. But these forces have run their course or are no longer powerful enough to offset a global economy that is now growing faster and a U.S. economy that may be busting through its full employment benchmark. The Federal Reserve is already moving expeditiously to raise rates, and if inflation picks up they will accelerate the pace. The current stock market volatility started because investors were suddenly spooked about inflation and the Federal Reserve’s response. Rising interest rates will likely put a brake on U.S. growth.

If there is a limit to how much more growth can be obtained with demand expansion, that leaves supply growth as the main possibility. Supply-side growth is deflationary. The Federal Reserve would be willing to accommodate faster growth if it came from either a more rapid increase in the labor force or faster productivity growth.

Getting much help from faster labor force growth is a non-starter. Labor force participation has been declining for years as a result of an aging population and the lack of good jobs. If the fiscal stimulus leads to a high-pressure economy and that opens up better jobs, there could be some improvement in labor supply. However, whatever is achieved in higher–than-expected labor supply among native-born women and men will be offset by the restrictions this administration is placing on immigrants. If there are sharp immigration cuts, we will not achieve the 0.5 percent a year growth in the workforce that is currently predicted by the Congressional Budget Office.

Productivity is much more of a wild card and very tough to predict. GDP per worker grew at around 2.3 percent a year from 1950 through the early 1970s. It grew at 1.3 percent until the mid-1990s, when it resumed rapid growth again, at 2.8 percent a year, until 2004. Then it slowed down to under 1.1 percent a year. Slow productivity growth is the biggest reason GDP has grown so slowly since 2004.5

Since productivity growth has had such an erratic pattern, it is hard to argue that it can’t or won’t speed up again. Suppose, by some miracle, GDP per worker growth were to return to the rate of 2.8 percent achieved from 1995 to 2004. Add in 0.5 percent a year growth in the workforce and GDP growth would then be 3.3 percent a year, achieving the administration’s estimates. On the other hand, suppose productivity growth does not increase, staying instead at the same pace it has had from 2004 through 2017. This would put long run GDP growth at 1.6 percent a year. If immigration restrictions drop the growth in the labor force down below 0.5 percent, then the lower bound for GDP growth is even lower, perhaps 1.3 percent. That is a big range of possible values and where the economy comes out will make a big difference to the growth of American living standards, and to the fortunes of this administration.

The trouble with predicting a return to much stronger growth is that none of the policy measures being introduced can be expected to yield the super rapid productivity growth achieved in the 1990s. There might be a lucky break and it would happen, but it is a very long shot. In making their forecasts, the Congressional Budget Office averages the period of rapid growth with the much slower growth since 2004 and estimates the long run sustainable growth rate of the economy is 1.9 percent per year. That number is actually fairly optimistic. It does not assume significant reductions in the number of immigrants and it does assume growth of GDP per worker that is 0.3 percent faster than the rate since 2004. One could score that figure as a success for Trump growth policies, except that his ambitions are so much greater.

The deficit

There are voices crying in the wilderness about the problem of the budget deficit and these voices have not got any traction. They are going to get louder. Annual federal deficits are expected to exceed a trillion dollars a year and the debt to GDP ratio is headed quickly for 100 percent. Will debt and deficits derail economic growth? The reason deficit warnings have not been heeded so far is that voters do not see adverse effects. Americans are able to make use of federal services, such as Social Security and Medicare, while taxpayers provide much less than the full cost of these programs. Those who worry about deficits argue, correctly, that our children and grandchildren will have to service the debt so we are passing our deficit spending on to them. However, as long as interest rates remained low that burden has not seemed too bad. Americans have financed budget deficits by borrowing from the rest of the world, but are borrowing at such low rates that it looks like a great deal.

Looking forward, the deficit problem may be catching up with us. As the debt to GDP ratio moves to 100 percent, that means each percentage point of interest on the debt has to be paid for by 1 percentage point of GDP in taxes or in additional borrowing. The Federal Reserve is already pushing up rates at the short end of the yield curve and with the projected level of Treasury borrowing, long rates are bound to rise too. If the holders of US Treasury securities, including a lot of foreigners and foreign governments, decide US debt is risky, they will start demanding a risk premium on Treasuries. As interest rates rise, that puts a damper on US investment. The cut in corporate taxes has given a boost to investment, but that could be reversed by rising interest rates.

Looking forward, the deficit problem may be catching up with us.

There is one part of the economy that is already feeling the effect of the budget deficits: the part exposed to foreign trade, particularly manufacturing. Borrowing from abroad constitutes an inflow of financial capital that pushes up the value of the dollar, making U.S. goods and services more expensive and imports cheaper. Large and persistent U.S. trade deficits started in the 1980s when big federal deficits first began. There is not a direct year-to-year connection between the budget deficit and the trade deficit because other factors can impact both of them. A recession increases the budget deficit and reduces the trade deficit, as happened in the Great Recession.

However, the connection between the budget deficit and the trade deficit does exist so that increases in the budget deficit will spill over into higher trade deficits in a full employment economy. That creates an irony for Trump’s policies. He has pledged to fight trade deficits by imposing trade restrictions, but these will be ineffective. Imposing trade barriers on Mexico, for example, will just shift U.S. imports to other products or other countries. In the meantime, the tax bill will push up the budget deficit and worsen the overall trade deficit.

Improving business sentiment versus unrealistic expectations

The most effective policy Trump has introduced to spur growth is to energize business leaders, making them more willing to invest and expand. The tax cut reinforces this by putting more money into the hands of companies and households and making the U.S. a more attractive place to invest.

But Trump has also introduced policies with a negative impact on growth, notably the restrictions on immigration and increases in the federal deficit. Trump seems incapable of any restraint in his claims of success and he talks about future growth rates that are very unlikely to occur. Over-promising and under-delivering is a dangerous game that can lead to disillusion and could undermine the optimism of business leaders. Perhaps the GDP statistics will soon be considered fake facts.","(3, 'inflation')"

The statements capped a week of mystifying assertion in which Trump also invented history by saying he won the women’s vote in the 2016 election, saw progress with North Korea that isn’t evident to his top diplomat and boasted of “success” and “record business” in U.S. health care programs that have yet to start.

A look at the claims:

2016 ELECTION

TRUMP: “I did win that women’s vote, didn’t I? Remember, they said, ‘Why would women vote for Trump?’ Well, I don’t know, but I got more than she did. That’s pretty good.” — remarks Thursday in Granite City, Ill.

THE FACTS: No, he didn’t. About 54 percent of women nationally voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to exit polls, compared with Trump’s 41 percent.

HEALTH CARE

TRUMP, on a health insurance option for small businesses and self-employed people: “I hear it’s like record business that they’re doing. We just opened about two months ago, and I’m hearing that the numbers are incredible. Numbers of people that are getting really, really good health care instead of Obamacare, which is a disaster.” — remarks Thursday in Peosta, Iowa.

THE FACTS: The Trump administration’s new health insurance option isn’t producing “record business,” because a roll-out of the plans doesn’t begin until September.

Even after the plans take effect, their impact is expected to be somewhat limited.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates a modest impact of 4 million people who will be covered by the association plans within five years. That’s compared with nearly 160 million who are covered by job-based insurance, the 12 million eligible for expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, also known as “Obamacare,” and the 10 million in the ACA’s private insurance markets.

WATCH: Funding cuts, premium increases and the future of Obamacare

TRUMP: “We’re greatly expanding telehealth and walk-in clinics so our veterans can get anywhere, at any time, they can get what they need, they can learn about the problem and they don’t necessarily have to drive long distances and wait. It’s been a very big success.” — remarks Tuesday to Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Kansas City, Missouri.

The Trump administration’s new health insurance option isn’t producing “record business,” because a roll-out of the plans doesn’t begin until September.

THE FACTS: A new benefit that would give the nation’s veterans access to commercially run walk-in clinics is not a success at all, because it hasn’t started.

It won’t begin for another year and the care won’t always be freely provided “anywhere, at any time.” Only veterans who have used VA health care services in the previous two years would be able to get care at the private walk-in clinics. After two visits, veterans could be subject to higher co-payments charged by the VA.

TRUMP: “We passed Veterans Choice, the biggest thing ever. … It has got to be the biggest improvement you can have. So now if you can’t get the treatment you need in a timely manner, people used to wait two weeks, three weeks, eight weeks, they couldn’t get to a doctor. You will have the right to see a private doctor immediately, and we will pay for it.” — remarks Tuesday.

THE FACTS: The care provided under the Choice program is not as immediate as Trump suggests, nor is it likely to be the “biggest thing” ever. Currently only veterans who endure waits of at least 30 days for an appointment at a VA facility are eligible to receive care immediately from private doctors at government expense, a standard that the VA is frequently unable to meet.

Under a newly expanded Choice program that will take at least a year to implement, veterans will still have to meet certain criteria before they can see a private physician.

A recent report by the Government Accountability Office found that despite the Choice program’s guarantee of providing an appointment within 30 days, veterans waited an average of 51 to 64 days.

ECONOMY AND TRADE

TRUMP: “We’ve accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions.” — remarks Friday on a new economic report.

THE FACTS: That doesn’t square with the record. Trump didn’t inherit a fixer-upper economy.

The U.S. economy just entered its 10th year of growth, a recovery that began under President Barack Obama, who inherited the Great Recession. The data show that the falling unemployment rate and gains in home values reflect the duration of the recovery, rather than any major changes made since 2017 by the Trump administration.

While Trump praised the 4.1 percent annual growth rate in the second quarter, it exceeded that level four times during the Obama presidency. But quarterly figures are volatile and strength in one quarter can be reversed in the next. While Obama never achieved the 3 percent annual growth that Trump hopes to see, he came close. The economy grew 2.9 percent in 2015.

The economy faces two significant structural drags that could keep growth closer to 2 percent than 3 percent: an aging population and weak productivity growth

The economy faces two significant structural drags that could keep growth closer to 2 percent than 3 percent: an aging population, which means fewer people are working and more are retired, and weak productivity growth, which means that those who are working aren’t increasing their output as quickly as in the past.

Both of those factors are largely beyond Trump’s control.

TRUMP: “One of the biggest wins in the report, and it is, indeed a big one, is that the trade deficit — very dear to my heart because we’ve been ripped off by the world — has dropped.” — remarks Friday.

THE FACTS: Trump is correct that a lower trade deficit helped growth in the April-June quarter, but it’s not necessarily for a positive reason.

The president has floated plans to impose import taxes on hundreds of billions of dollars of foreign goods, which has led to the risk of retaliatory tariffs by foreign companies on U.S. goods.

This threat of an escalating trade war has led many companies to increase their levels of trade before any tariffs hit, causing the temporary boost in exports being celebrated by Trump.

Richard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial, said the result is that the gains from trade in the second quarter will not be repeated.

WATCH: What the strong economic growth means for average Americans

TRUMP: “We’re having the best economy we’ve ever had in the history of our country.” — remarks Thursday in Granite City, Illinois.

THE FACTS: This is not the best the U.S. economy has ever been.

The unemployment rate is near a 40-year low and growth is solid, but by many measures the current economy trails other periods in U.S. history. Average hourly pay, before adjusting for inflation, is rising at about a 2.5 percent annual rate, below the 4 percent level reached in the late 1990s when the unemployment rate was as low as it is now.

Pay was growing even faster in the late 1960s, when the jobless rate remained below 4 percent for nearly four years. And economic growth topped 4 percent for three full years from 1998 through 2000, an annual rate it hasn’t touched since.

TRUMP: “The Canadians, you have a totally closed market … they have a 375 percent tax on dairy products, other than that it’s wonderful to deal. And we have a very big deficit with Canada, a trade deficit.” — remarks Thursday in Peosta, Iowa.

THE FACTS: No, it’s not closed. Because of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Canada’s market is almost totally open to the United States. Each country has a few products that are still largely protected, such as dairy in Canada and sugar in the United States.

Trump also repeated his claim that the U.S. has a trade deficit with Canada, but that is true only in goods. When services are included, such as insurance, tourism, and engineering, the U.S. had a $2.8 billion surplus with Canada last year.

TRUMP: “Veterans’ unemployment has fallen to the lowest level in almost 18 years. … And I’ll guarantee, within a month or two months, that 18 will be even a much higher number.” — remarks Tuesday at VFW convention.

THE FACTS: This boast is based on outdated numbers.

The veterans’ unemployment rate was 3.3 percent in June, a low rate historically, but that is still above the 2.7 percent rate in October, which was the lowest in nearly 17 years.

Veterans’ unemployment has fallen mostly for the same reasons that joblessness has fallen for everyone else: strong hiring and steady economic growth for the past eight years.

The vets’ unemployment rate peaked at 9.9 percent in January 2011, then fell by more than half to 4.5 percent by the time Trump was inaugurated in January 2017. Since then, it has fallen an additional 1.2 percentage points.

Trump won’t be able to get to a higher number than 18 years, as he promises to do, because the data only go back to 2000.

NORTH KOREA

TRUMP: “We’re also pursuing the denuclearization of North Korea and a new future of prosperity, security, and peace on the Korean Peninsula and all of Asia. New images, just today, show that North Korea has begun the process of dismantling a key missile site. And we appreciate that. We had a fantastic meeting with Chairman Kim, and it seems to be going very well.” — remarks Tuesday.

THE FACTS: Trump’s assessment that his administration’s plan to dismantle North Korea’s nuclear weapons is “going very well” is not fully shared by his own secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. In fact, Pompeo acknowledged this past week that the North is still producing fissile material for nuclear weapons.

Trump made his remarks after the North Korea-focused 38 North website released recent satellite imagery that seems to show dismantlement underway at Sohae.

But Pompeo sounded a note of caution. He said that while such a step would be in line with the pledges that Kim made to Trump at the June 12 summit in Singapore, it would have to be confirmed by international inspectors.

Analysts say dismantling a few facilities at the site alone won’t realistically reduce North Korea’s military capability or represent a material step toward denuclearization.

Indeed, at a Senate hearing Wednesday, Pompeo acknowledged that North Korea continues to produce fuel for nuclear weapons despite Kim’s pledge to denuclearize. Pompeo said there was “an awful long way to go” before North Korea could no longer be viewed as a nuclear threat.

AMAZON AND MANUFACTURING

TRUMP: “The Amazon Washington Post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the Internet Tax Case in the U.S. Supreme Court two months ago. Next up is the U.S. Post Office which they use, at a fraction of real cost, as their ‘delivery boy’ for a BIG percentage of their packages…” — tweet July 23.

THE FACTS: He’s wrong to suggest that the U.S. Postal Service delivers packages for Amazon below cost. Federal regulators in fact have reviewed the Amazon contract with the Postal Service each year and determined it to be profitable.

READ MORE: Trump says he’s taking ‘a pretty serious look’ at Amazon

Trump is upset with Amazon because its founder, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post, which Trump has labeled “fake news” after the newspaper reported unfavorable developments during his campaign and presidency.

While the Postal Service has lost money for 11 years, package delivery, a bright spot, is not the reason.

Boosted by e-commerce, the Postal Service has enjoyed double-digit increases in revenue from delivering packages, but that hasn’t been enough to offset pension and health care costs as well as declines in first-class letters and marketing mail. Together, letters and marketing mail make up more than two-thirds of postal revenue.

Amazon sends packages via the post office, FedEx, UPS and other services, and has taken steps toward becoming more self-reliant in shipping.

TRUMP: “On the South Lawn, you have the space capsule. And every part is made right here, in America.” — remarks July 23 at Made in America event.

THE FACTS: Trump neglects to mention a key detail: NASA’s Orion crew capsule, one of the star products at the White House event celebrating U.S. manufacturing, will ride through space thanks to Europe.

With its four solar-array wings, the European Service Module supplies propulsion, power and the essentials of life for the capsule’s space travels and marks a departure for NASA.

“For the first time,” the agency says, “NASA will use a European-built system as a critical element to power an American spacecraft.” Airbus, Boeing’s prime competitor in commercial air travel, leads an array of European companies that made the service module.

The private forecast, one of several delivered to Trump and described by three people familiar with the briefing, contrasts sharply with the triumphant rhetoric the president and his surrogates have repeatedly used to describe the economy.

Even as his aides warn of a business climate at risk of faltering, the president has been portraying the economy to the public as “phenomenal” and “incredible.” He has told aides that he thinks he can convince Americans that the economy is vibrant and unrattled through a public messaging campaign. But the internal and external warnings that the economy could slip have contributed to a muddled and often contradictory message.

Administration officials have scrambled this week to assemble a menu of actions Trump could take to avert an economic downturn. Few aides have a firm sense of what steps he would seriously consider, in part because he keeps changing his mind.

Ideas that have been discussed include imposing a currency transaction tax that could weaken the dollar and make U.S. exports more competitive; creating a rotation among the Federal Reserve governors that would make it easier to check the power of Chair Jerome H. Powell, whom Trump has blamed for not doing all he can to increase growth; and pushing to lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent in an effort to spur more investment. Some, if not all, of these steps would require congressional approval.

[Trump says the economy is now the ‘greatest.’ Here’s how it compares to Obama’s.]

“Everyone is nervous — everyone,” said a Republican with close ties to the White House and congressional GOP leaders. “It’s not a panic, but they are nervous.”

This article is based on interviews with more than 25 current and former administration officials, lawmakers, and external advisers who have been in contact with Trump and his team throughout August. Some spoke on the condition of anonymity because the White House has been requesting that allies and aides keep its economic message intact.

Compounding Trump’s situation, some of the economy’s strains appear to be of his own making, as uncertainty surrounding his trade war with China has frozen much investment nationwide.

“The China trade war is causing most of this,” said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who is close to Trump. “It’s just the world economy is affected when China has a problem.”

Trump has publicly gloated about economic problems in China and Europe — even declaring last Sunday that “the world is in a recession right now” — but those strains appear to be holding back U.S. growth as well.

The economic message emanating from the White House is a product of tensions and debates about how to handle that bracing reality — and Trump’s own stubbornness on trade strategy and his anger about news coverage of the economy.

That has led to a month of tense economic policymaking and markets. On Aug. 1, Trump announced new tariffs against Chinese imports. On Aug. 13, he delayed most of them, worried about the impact on the U.S. economy. On Aug. 20, he said he was considering new tax cuts. The next day, he said he had changed his mind.

Amid it all, stocks proved highly volatile and the U.S. and global bond markets rang numerous alarm bells, a far cry from the era of synchronized global growth that had marked Trump’s first two years in office. Other economic soft spots also have emerged, particularly in U.S. manufacturing, a sector Trump had promised to revive.

Although Trump sold himself to voters in 2016 as a master businessman who knew just what to do to rev up the economy, his stewardship could now have major implications for his reelection chances, especially if the more pessimistic forecasts prove prescient.

But beyond the political impact, Trump’s handling of the economic slowdown has opened up the White House to scathing criticism from members of past economic teams, who have contended that the flailing process and lack of traditionally credentialed economists at the helm could exacerbate a downturn.

[American consumers are holding up the global economy. But for how long?]

“The irony here is that Trump’s erratic, chaotic approach to the economy is probably the most significant economic risk factor in the world right now,” said Gene Sperling, who served in top economic roles during the Clinton and Obama administrations. “Their response is just to show even more erratic behavior. It’s economic narcissism. It’s economic policy by whim, pride, ego and tantrum.”

White House spokesman Judd Deere defended the administration’s approach and said officials remain very optimistic about the economy’s performance.

“The White House does not think we are imminently headed for” a downturn, he said. “The fundamentals of the economy are strong because of this president’s pro-growth policies.”

Trump has lauded the economy as the best in U.S. history, while some of his Democratic rivals have said it is barreling toward a recession.

Neither of those descriptions is quite accurate, most economists say. Parts of the economy, particularly consumer spending and the labor market, remain robust. Retail sales are strong, and wages are rising. But business investment, the ballooning federal deficit and trade concerns are creating pressure that White House officials have struggled to explain away. And some of these problems are worsening.

“This administration has not done itself a whole lot of favors in talking about the economy,” said Tony Fratto, who served in senior roles during the George W. Bush administration at the White House and the Treasury Department. “They have done a lot of communicating that is verifiably false on the economy.”

Trump has a lean and increasingly combative economic team, whose members often are at odds with one another on trade and tax policy. Almost all are deferential to the president, but they habitually jostle to advance their causes with him, sometimes maneuvering behind one another’s backs.

White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have fought for months over Kudlow’s push to index capital gains taxes to inflation, for example, with Trump caught in the middle. The proposal would reduce taxes on investment income, primarily benefiting people with higher incomes, but most economists think that would do little to spur immediate economic growth.

White House economic team meetings are less structured than when Trump’s aides collectively pushed a giant corporate and individual income tax cut into law two years ago. Sometimes aides walk out unsure of what was agreed on. Sometimes nothing was agreed on.

But that format drew little scrutiny when advisers were used to primarily boast about the economy’s strength to the news media in the past year. Now, these aides have come under extreme pressure this month as Trump has gyrated in his economic approach and vented his frustration inside the West Wing.

Mnuchin has privately disagreed with key aspects of Trump’s approach to the economy, according to people familiar with the matter. But he has largely disappeared from public view during the turbulent month. Kevin Hassett, a former Council of Economic Advisers chairman and a frequent media commentator, has left the administration.

Stepping into their void is Kudlow, a Reagan administration official and longtime television commentator; senior trade adviser Peter Navarro, an academic with a long history of anti-China positions; and Trump himself, who often undercuts or contradicts his aides, only to reverse himself the next day.

Republicans on Capitol Hill have sensed the White House’s stress and said the goal is to beat back negative public opinion.

“It’s not economic data that’s driving the concern as much as headlines and the stock market having a big drop,” said Rep. Mark Meadows (N.C.), a close Trump ally. “It becomes a headline, then it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy that is not based on any underlying economic fundamentals. There’s a real proactive effort by the White House to try and make sure the economy continues in a robust manner.”

The current economic drama began on the first day of this month, when over the objection of some senior advisers, Trump announced that he would impose tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports. Just days earlier, the president had signaled that he was ready to back down from his fight with the Chinese, speculating that Beijing wanted to wait until after the 2020 election to negotiate a trade deal.

But a fruitless visit Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer made to Shanghai infuriated Trump, several people briefed on his reaction said, and he announced the tariffs in a Twitter post shortly after they returned. At the time, Navarro was the only aide who supported the move.

That announcement began a chaotic chain of economic and political events that White House aides have struggled to control ever since.

The following weekend, China’s currency weakened, a move that would make its exports more competitive, and Chinese officials signaled that they would not be increasing purchases of U.S. farm products, as Trump had demanded.

So on Monday, amid fears that the trade war would spiral out of control, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 767 points. Trump strongly urged Mnuchin to label China a currency manipulator, a symbolic yet harmless shaming that the secretary had resisted because the Treasury Department’s indicators didn’t show that China qualified for such a label. But under pressure, the treasury chief did so shortly after the stock market closed.

Meanwhile, U.S. business executives panicked about the scope of Trump’s new tariffs, and White House officials were bombarded with complaints. So Trump began drawing up plans to delay the tariffs on products such as laptop computers, shoes and clothing. This posed a problem, though.

Trump had insisted for more than a year, without evidence, that China was paying all of the tariffs. This was false, because tariffs are paid by U.S. importers and collected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. For the first time in months, Trump’s economic message showed signs of cracking. He would soon admit that his economic approach could harm consumers.

On Aug. 13, Lighthizer’s office issued a news release with little fanfare announcing that tariffs on nearly $160 billion in Chinese imports had been delayed until Dec. 15. Trump would later tell reporters that the intent was to ensure that Americans didn’t pay higher costs during the holidays, one of the first times he had acknowledged that the tariffs raised costs.

“What we’ve done is we’ve delayed it so they won’t be relevant in the Christmas shopping season,” he said at the time.

The stock market rallied amid a sense that Trump was preparing to back down, but economic fears grew deeper the next day.

On Aug. 14, key parts of the U.S. bond market tipped over, creating an “inverted yield curve,” an unusual condition in which investors are rushing to buy ultrasafe long-term assets and that often precedes a recession. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 800 points.

In the middle of the day, Trump tried to spin the inversion as a positive thing, saying it was a reflection of how attractive U.S. debt was to consumers. But after the stock market closed, his Twitter feed took on a more furious tone.

He cited the “CRAZY INVERTED YIELD CURVE” and blamed a “clueless” Powell from the Fed.

Through the week, White House officials became increasingly agitated that the public sentiment about the economy seemed to be tipping. Trump, aides said, is obsessed with media coverage of the economy, and thinks Americans will believe negative news and stop spending money. This exasperation began several months earlier.

“In the last couple of weeks, when the market dipped down, it did strike an amount of fear within the White House,” a White House official said. “There’s been a sense going into 2020 that we can bounce back from virtually everything if the economy stays strong.”

The day after the yield curve inverted, Kudlow said in an interview with The Washington Post that the economy was much stronger and more resilient than people were making it out to be.

“What I see is a pretty good second half coming up,” he said.

Trump, however, kept talking with advisers inside and outside the White House and was getting a mixed picture. Still, White House officials complained that news outlets were elevating negative economic news in a way that discounted the progress the White House had made.

Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, said the media coverage of any economic downturn is “way overblown.”

“If it’s not Russia, it’s racism. If it’s not racism, it’s a recession,” she said.

Kudlow took a lead role in the White House’s pushback on Aug. 18, appearing on two television programs to try to quell fears of a recession.

“I don’t see a recession at all,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.” On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” he urged Americans, “Let’s not be afraid of optimism.”

A few hours later, though, Trump stepped on that message. Speaking to reporters in New Jersey before returning to Washington, he said, “The world is in a recession right now,” attempting to draw a contrast with the United States, which is not.

By the time Kudlow and Trump made their comments, a freewheeling policy process had taken hold. Some White House officials had begun discussing whether to slash payroll tax rates, although a number of senior officials were never told this was under consideration. Americans pay 6.2 percent of their paychecks to fund Social Security, but in the past Congress has temporarily reduced this payment as a way to spur more spending and help the economy in a downturn.

When The Post reported that the idea was being discussed on Monday afternoon, the White House issued an anonymous statement saying the idea wasn’t “under consideration at this time.” The reason for trying to shoot down the news, two people briefed on the planning said, was a sense that the public would think the White House was panicking if it was revealed that it was contemplating what could be a $100 billion tax cut.

Bad economic news continued. On Monday night, news outlets reported that U.S. Steel could be temporarily laying off up to 200 workers at a Michigan facility. Trump had claimed that his trade policies had revived U.S. Steel around the country, but the company was confronted with lower steel prices and weaker demand than expected.

By Tuesday, Trump was under growing pressure to explain how he was preparing for a possible slowdown.

He said that he was considering a payroll tax cut, as well as the capital gains change for which Kudlow had long advocated. His comments stunned some aides but others shrugged them off, aware that it is nearly impossible to be up to speed on what Trump is thinking at any given moment, even on particular issues such as tax policy.

When Trump made the comments, his economic team was scattered. Mnuchin was on vacation, and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney was 2,000 miles away at a donor event in Jackson, Wyo.

Mulvaney struck an upbeat but realistic tone about the economy, according to one attendee who was not authorized to speak publicly.

He noted that there were signs of an economic slowdown but argued at length that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. He said if there was a recession, it would be “moderate and short,” according to an attendee who wasn’t authorized to disclose the comments.

When aides presented Trump with the news that the economy could weaken in the next year, it was just one scenario.

White House officials stressed that they still expect the economy to perform very strongly this year, with the gross domestic product growing 3 percent from 2018. Few others are as optimistic. The Fed estimates that GDP will grow just 2.1 percent.

By Wednesday, Trump had reversed himself again. He told reporters before boarding a helicopter that he had decided to rule out any new tax cuts after all.

“We don’t need it,” he said. “We have a strong economy.”

The old saying “time heals all wounds” applies to the economy. Stung by the Great Recession, it has taken a decade for many Americans to feel safe in their jobs and investments again.

The polls tell the story. As 2019 winds down, the economy is getting its best rating in almost 20 years. Overall, 76% of those polled rate the economy very or somewhat good, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. That’s up nine points from last year and the highest percentage since February 2001.

Time gets some of the credit. The president and his bullish megaphone get the rest.

Although the economy was well into recovery by the time Barack Obama left office, President Donald Trump came to the White House channeling the people in districts left behind. The big question for 2020 is whether they feel like he has helped them enough.

In his presidency, 443,000 new factory jobs have been created, far better than during the Obama years. But that growth has stalled and now the sector has turned into a recession.

Still, much of market and consumer psychology is confidence, a quality Trump has in surplus. He rarely misses a chance in front of the cameras and on Twitter to claim he has created the best economy in American history. He credits his tax cuts from 2017 and vast rollbacks of regulation.

On the debate stage last night, Democrats tried to make the case the Trump economy isn’t working for everyone.

Former Vice President Joe Biden wants to take back some of the president’s corporate tax cuts.

“We have to eliminate significant number of these God awful tax cuts that were given to the wealthy,” he said.

Senator Bernie Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg zeroed in on stagnant wages.

“People are not getting paid enough, that is not the result of some mysterious cosmic force that is the result of bad policy,” Buttigieg said.

Senator Elizabeth Warren wants to tax the mega rich to pay for programs for everyone else and Sanders wants free government-run healthcare.

Though knocking Trump on the economy is a tough sell, it is not as supercharged as the president claims. Job creation in his first 33 months in office trails the final 33 months of the Obama years.

The 2.1% economic growth in the third quarter is not the 3%, 4%, 5% or even 6% growth he promised.

But it is good enough. Recession fears from the summer have evaporated. The unemployment rate is at 50-year low. The S&P 500 is up 27% this year and the major US stock market averages are near record highs.

For markets, Trump’s impeachment is a non-event. The trade war with China ends the year simmering, not boiling. And the House passed the big modernization of NAFTA, with the Senate expected to finalize it in the New Year.

For now, the economy is clearly advantage-Trump.","(0, 'GDP')"

It is time now for others in the region, some of great wealth, to protect their own territory. THE USA IS GREAT! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019

The U.S. military began withdrawing troops from northern Syria on Monday, paving the way for what the White House on Sunday referred to as a ""long-planned"" Turkish operation in the area. The Pentagon issued a statement later on Monday clarifying they would not support or endorse such an operation.

Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have condemned the president's plan, calling it a betrayal that would leave Kurdish forces who've taken the lead in fighting ISIS terrorists for the United States at the mercy of the Turkish military. Turkey has long considered Kurdish fighters in Syria as a threat and experts on Monday told NBC News that the U.S. withdrawal could destabilize the region.

Trump, who spoke to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan by phone prior to Sunday's announcement, did not say what actions he would consider to be ""off limits.""

At a White House event later Monday, Trump was asked why he was siding with Turkey and its authoritarian president over allies who have been fighting the Islamic State for years. He said, ""I'm not siding with anyone.""

He also said he told Erdogan if any of ""our people"" got hurt there would be ""big trouble."" He said that the U.S. would ""try"" to protect the Kurds against the Turkish military.

""The Kurds are natural enemies [with Turkey], they’ve been fighting for hundreds of years. We interject ourselves into wars, and tribal wars, and revolution, they’re not the kind of things you settle the way you want to settle,"" he said. ""China and Russia love that we are bogged down.

Trump also brushed off a suggestion that U.S. military officials were blindsided by the move.

""I consulted with everybody,"" he said. ""I always consult with everybody.""

In an earlier tweet, he argued: ""The endless and ridiculous wars are ENDING! We will be focused on the big picture, knowing we can always go back & BLAST!""

Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle spoke out against Trump's decision.

“Once again, President Trump is deserting an ally in a foolish attempt to appease an authoritarian strongman,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in reference to Erdogan. ""By turning operational responsibility over to the Turks, President Trump has abandoned our Kurdish partners. This decision poses a dire threat to regional security and stability, and sends a dangerous message to Iran and Russia, as well as our allies, that the United States is no longer a trusted partner.

Sen. Pat Toomey, R.-Penn., said in a statement that the decision to withdraw U.S. forces from the northern Syrian border poses ""a significant threat to our national security and risks reversing the progress made in the region to destroy ISIS.""

""It could also lead to war between Turkey and Syrian Kurds, a result that will boost enemy regimes in Syria, Iran, and Russia,"" Toomey said. ""This betrayal of the Kurds will also severely harm our credibility as an ally the world over.”

Trump shrugged off the criticisms while speaking to reporters at the White House. ""They have their opinion, and a lot of people do,"" he said, but others ""are extremely thrilled."" ""Many people agree with it very strongly,"" Trump said.","(4, 'national debt')"

As 2019 comes to a close, the US economy earns its highest ratings in almost two decades, potentially boosting President Donald Trump in matchups against the Democrats vying to face him in next year’s election, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS.

Overall, 76% rate economic conditions in the US today as very or somewhat good, significantly more than those who said so at this time last year (67%). This is the highest share to say the economy is good since February 2001, when 80% said so.

Almost all Republicans (97%) say economic conditions are good right now, as do 75% of independents and 62% of Democrats. Positive ratings are up across parties compared with August of this year, when 91% of Republicans, 62% of independents and 47% of Democrats said the economy was in good shape.

Looking ahead, nearly 7 in 10 expect the economy to be in good shape a year from now (68%), the best outlook in CNN polling since December 2003. The new finding includes 63% who say things are good now and will continue to be good next year, while just 9% say they economy is currently good but will turn south in 2020.

The matchups against Trump

As perceptions of the economy have brightened, the poll also shows matchups between the top Democrats vying for the 2020 nomination and Trump tightening. In October, four Democrats tested in hypothetical head-to-head contests with Trump among registered voters lead by anywhere from six to 10 percentage points, all advantages outside that poll’s margin of sampling error.

Now, just two of those candidates hold edges at or above the error margin: former Vice President Joe Biden leads Trump nationally 49% to 44%, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders tops Trump 49% to 45%. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg each run about even with the President.

The poll was conducted before the House voted to impeach Trump on Wednesday and the Democrats held their sixth primary debate on Thursday.

Across battleground states (a group which includes the 15 states decided by 8 points or less in 2016) – all four Democrats run within the margin of error of Trump. Biden and Trump tie at 47% each, while Trump holds 48% support to Warren’s 46%, 48% to Buttigieg’s 43%, and 49% to Sanders’ 45%.

The tighter margins against the president come as favorability ratings appear to be sliding for the top Democratic contenders, according to results from the same poll released earlier this week. Biden notches his first net-negative rating in CNN’s polling since 2015, with 39% now holding a favorable view and 47% unfavorable.

Sanders splits the public: 43% see him favorably, 44% unfavorably, a dip since October but about on par with his ratings earlier this year.

Warren’s favorable numbers have slipped 4 points since October and are significantly net-negative now, 34% favorable to 43% unfavorable. Buttigieg has seen an uptick in unfavorable views (27% now, up from 23% in October) to match his favorable rating (27%), but he remains the least-well-known of the top Democratic contenders, with 46% saying they haven’t heard of him or don’t know enough to have an opinion.

The President’s favorability rating has remained steady since CNN’s October poll – 43% have a favorable opinion of Trump, 53% unfavorable.

But shifts in views on the Democratic candidates may not be as negative a sign as they were in 2016. Those registered voters who hold an unfavorable opinion of Trump and his Democratic opponent are much more likely to favor the Democratic candidate over Trump in that matchup. Among those who have a negative opinion of both Trump and Biden, for example, 72% support Biden in a hypothetical matchup while 9% prefer Trump. Those who don’t like either Sanders or Trump break for Sanders, 59% to 18%, and the pattern holds for Warren and Buttigieg as well.

In 2016, by contrast, those who had an unfavorable opinion of both Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Trump broke for Trump 47% to 30% for Clinton, with 19% backing third party candidates, according to exit polls.

Trade and USMCA

More than half (55%) approve of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement – the new trade agreement between the US, Mexico, and Canada which would replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, fulfilling a prominent campaign promise in Trump’s 2016 run for the presidency.

Fewer (13%) disapprove and around a third aren’t sure or don’t have an opinion of Trump’s proposed trade deal. Already, the agreement provokes partisan division, with 70% of Republicans approving, 53% of independents and 44% of Democrats.

Seven in 10 see foreign trade generally as more of an opportunity for economic growth through increased US exports (71%) rather than a threat to the economy from foreign imports (16%), steady since this time last year. On that, there is rare partisan agreement. Around seven in 10 Democrats, Republicans, and independents agree that foreign trade is an opportunity for growth.

The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS December 12 through 15 among a random national sample of 1,005 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. For results among the subset of 888 registered voters, the error margin is plus or minus 4.0 percentage points.","(0, 'GDP')"

Despite President Trump's impeachment — not to mention his erratic, bullying, bigoted behavior — could the economy nonetheless hand him a second term in 2020?

It's definitely a possibility. In fact, a number of observers who run models of elections are already predicting Trump will take home the win. But nothing is certain, and such predictions hinge on the crucial assumption that economic indicators mean the same thing today that they meant one or two or three or more decades ago.

For a long time now, political science has recognized that the performance of the economy — especially its performance in the year before an election — has a very strong influence on how things shake out. Trump may well prove the exception, given both his outlandish personal characteristics, and the fact that he's now only the third president to ever actually be impeached by the House of Representatives. But an upward trending economy tends to mean victory for the incumbent, while an economy on the downturn tends to mean the challenger will win.

Yale University professor Ray Fair, Oxford Economics Ltd., and Moody's Analytics Inc. are all outfits that run election prediction models, for instance. They don't rely solely on the economy. But factors like GDP growth trends, inflation, and the unemployment rate play big roles in their projections. Bloomberg spoke to all three recently, and they were all predicting re-election for the White House's current occupant. ""The election is Trump's to lose,"" Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, bluntly put it. ""Trump wins if the economy and his approval rating are about the same a year from now as today, and turnout is typical."" Moody's has accurately called every election over the last two decades except for 2016. Oxford got 16 of the last 18 elections right.

Granted, these predictions all come with some caveats. But if you dig down into the nitty-gritty of economic data, below the headline numbers like unemployment and GDP growth, there are other positive signs for Trump. While wage growth overall remains somewhat sluggish compared to previous times when unemployment got this low, wage growth for low earners specifically has picked up in the last year or two. Poorer Americans are now seeing their incomes grow as fast as they did in the peak of the last recovery, just before the 2008 collapse. African-Americans and Hispanic Americans are enjoying record low unemployment rates.

Crazy as it may sound to many liberals, the Trump campaign thinks it can pick up some more votes among these minority groups. They don't think they can flip all that many. But Trump's team is basically aiming to replay his 2016 win, where he prevails despite his low approval ratings by holding key Rust Belt and battleground states, and thus keeps an edge in the Electoral College. Flipping even a modest number of minority voters in those states would definitely shore up the strategy's chances of success.

Yet there are other complications that push in the opposite direction.

For instance, in the last year, the economic situation in states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan has taken a downturn. After a job boom in 2017 and 2018, the manufacturing sector reversed course, and has now bled out nearly all the jobs it gained since Trump entered office. Counties in the Midwest that switched their votes from President Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 have lost jobs in retail, mining, and natural resources, as well as manufacturing, and some of their unemployment rates have begun to inch back up.

That's a bad sign for Trump's strategy of holding his own in those crucial states. It's worth noting that many of these same communities were in something of a mini-recession in the runup to 2016 as well. As I said, economic conditions that are heading down tend to favor the challenger, and that probably goes a long way towards explaining why the Democrats' ""blue wall"" collapsed in 2016. In between 2016 and the last year, those areas enjoyed a rebound. It's just now they look like they're reversing course again.

Recent polling of battleground states found voters' satisfaction with their economic situation dropping, while they've gone from approving of Trump's handling of the economy by a net of 10 percentage points, to approving and disapproving in equal measure. If the slump continues for the next year, Trump will be the incumbent who likely pays the price.

It's also worth keeping in mind the guesswork behind models that look at things like GDP growth and the unemployment rate to predict election outcomes. The implicit assumption here is that the benefits of growing GDP or low unemployment are broadly shared across American society — and thus will reliably lift voters' moods across a wide swath of areas.

But that assumption is looking more and more rickety. Rising inequality inherently means that the same amount of GDP growth benefits fewer people. In the broader context, the recent uptick in wage growth is a minor shift in a decades-long trend of stagnating wages. Over the same time period, costs for things like housing, health care and child care have risen significantly. Meaning we actually need a much longer burst of high wage growth today for Americans to reach the same level of financial security they had during, say, the late 1990s boom. The unemployment rate also has problems, and other indicators suggest that low unemployment rates are less indicative today of the true health of the labor market than they were two decades ago. Finally, real GDP growth, while it's positive, is significantly slower today than it was two decades back in the 1990s, never mind in the 1960s.

Americans feel all this, too. According to recent polling, two thirds of voters think the economy is helping the rich; but only a third say it's helping the middle class, and even fewer say it's helping the poor.

What all this means, ultimately, is not necessarily that the economy is actually bad news for Trump. It simply might be less good news than it first appears. The election is still almost a year out, and a lot could happen in both directions. Despite his low popularity, Trump's job approval on the economy specifically remains 52 percent.

The president still has plenty of routes to victory.

320,What Trump’s tariffs have cost the U.S. economy - PBS NewsHour,What Trump’s tariffs have cost the U.S. economy  PBS NewsHour,"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBicy5vcmcvbmV3c2hvdXIvZWNvbm9teS9tYWtpbmctc2Vuc2Uvd2hhdC10cnVtcHMtdGFyaWZmcy1oYXZlLWNvc3QtdGhlLXUtcy1lY29ub2150gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGJzLm9yZy9uZXdzaG91ci9hbXAvZWNvbm9teS9tYWtpbmctc2Vuc2Uvd2hhdC10cnVtcHMtdGFyaWZmcy1oYXZlLWNvc3QtdGhlLXUtcy1lY29ub215?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,PBS NewsHour,"Editor’s note: This analysis is being published in collaboration with EconoFact, a nonpartisan economic publication.

Even if the mini trade deal made between the U.S. and China on Friday provides some relief to farmers who export to China, the tariffs that are already in place and the threat of a renewed escalation present enormous costs to Americans.

Economists from academia and the policy sphere have used a variety of methods to estimate the impact of new tariffs implemented in 2018 and 2019 on U.S. firms and households. Variation across emerging estimates reflects more than measurement issues. The costs imposed by tariffs go beyond the direct dollar-price increases resulting from these new taxes on targeted goods. There are efficiency costs and uncertainty about their future path.

Tariffs also may benefit protected sectors of the economy and are a source of government revenue. The evolving range of estimates depends on which costs and benefits are taken into account. Estimates of the average gross annual cost of tariffs levied in 2018 through the first half of 2019 tend toward $800 per household. Estimates of net costs vary more widely. When setting aside policy uncertainty, they vary from about $60 to $500.

(Click here for a larger version of the table with a complete listing of studies mentioned, their estimates, and the different factors each study takes into account.)

The latest studies suggest the combination of new tariffs and increased trade policy uncertainty create a substantial drag on the economy as a whole: net losses projected for 2020 are between about $500 and $1700 per household.

Costs imposed by tariffs go beyond direct dollar-price increases on targeted goods. Evolving estimates range in value depending on what they take into account.

The facts

A tariff is a tax imposed on goods that the U.S. buys from other countries. An important part of the cost of the tariffs for U.S. households and firms consists of the tax incidence — the portion of the tax that is passed on to various buyers and sellers of targeted goods once they arrive at the U.S. border. One study finds that the group of tariffs levied only during the year 2018 would raise the cost of the consumption bundle for the average household by $135 dollars (see this table for a summary of all studies mentioned, their estimates, and the different factors each study takes into account). An update by the same authors estimates the costs of tariffs imposed in 2018 and through June 2019 will cost the average U.S. household $247 per year, or $460 per household per year when including those planned through December 2019.

Beyond adding up how much U.S. buyers expend on tariffs, or which buyers bear the greatest incidence, an accounting of the full costs of the tariffs should include the fact that the taxes also generate efficiency losses. Households and firms may have to substitute away from goods targeted by the tariff toward alternatives that cost more than they were paying before, or that are less well suited to their needs or preferences. Some buyers at the margin may find that they are no longer able to afford as much of the good, or may decide to go without it. These broader costs, called “deadweight loss,” may be between half and 3 times the direct burden of the tariff (see here for a concise breakdown of tariff payments versus deadweight loss). Two studies find that the cost of tariffs levied only during the year 2018, including both the direct cost and the deadweight loss from the tariff, totals $400 to $500 (see Fajgelbaum, Goldberg, Kennedy, and Khandelwal (2019) and Amiti, Redding and Weinstein (2019) in the table). Two studies estimate that the cost of tariffs levied in 2018 and the first half of 2019, including both the direct burden and the deadweight loss, amounts to roughly $800 per household (see here and here, also in the table).

Tariffs can result in diffuse price increases that are difficult for researchers to measure with precision in real-time. Academic research suggests — and companies have announced — that firms whose costs are affected by tariffs may spread theses costs across goods that were not targeted by the tariff. The objective may be to minimize the number of goods exhibiting a large retail price hike, which can disrupt sales volumes. However, this type of strategic pricing also may enable stores to pass on a higher fraction of the costs. Domestic producers in U.S. industries protected by tariffs (as well as foreign producers not subject to the tariffs applied to Chinese goods) may also raise prices on their goods in the U.S. market, adding another layer of complexity in measuring the overall impact on prices for consumers. Production of some goods may be flexible enough that a tariff on varieties from only one country will have no effect at all. Economists are still studying exactly how much the changes in the prices of targeted goods as they cross the border translate into prices charged to the final purchasers as opposed to being absorbed by firms and distributors as losses on the supply-side

The trade policy uncertainty can affect the investment and hiring decisions of firms, slowing economic activity. Tariffs have been introduced rapidly; their ultimate size, scope and duration is as yet unknown; and the range of retaliatory tariffs is likewise evolving. All of these issues present uncertainty, introducing an additional risk in investing and hiring because firms may find it harder to anticipate the costs of imported inputs or the scope of their export market. This results in the economy growing less than it otherwise would. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that combined with the deadweight losses from tariffs, policy uncertainty will cause U.S. gross domestic product to be 0.3 percentage points lower in 2020 than it otherwise would be. The Federal Reserve Board of Governors, using a more detailed measure of trade policy uncertainty, estimates that GDP will be a full percentage point lower in 2020 than it otherwise would be, driven by disruption in investment and industrial production. These two studies suggest these losses will amount to between $500 and $1,700 per household on average in 2020 alone.

Some studies account either explicitly or implicitly for increased profits and wages in industries protected by the new tariffs and for tariff revenues as a source of government revenue. While the imposition of tariffs may make the economy less well off in general, this does not mean that it is a loss for everyone: tariffs generate gains for some firms. For instance, protection from foreign competition allows some firms to raise their price — increasing their profits and the wages they are able to pay. Like other taxes, tariffs also are a source of government revenue. Taking this into account can affect estimates of the overall cost of tariffs: one study that includes these factors (but does not include the broader uncertainty) finds net effects from the 2018 tariffs as low as $61 per household per year, on average. The empirical approaches by the Congressional Budget Office and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors implicitly allow for some benefits to be factored in, but still find net losses from changes in trade policy (with uncertainty) through June 2019 of roughly $500 to $1700 per year in 2020, averaged across households.

Most studies assume substantial pass-through of the tariffs into the prices that households and firms pay for targeted goods. Studies of the first year and a half of the new tariffs suggest that the entire cost of the tariffs did, indeed, appear in the prices of goods targeted for tariffs as they crossed the border into the United States. The substantial pass-through of tariffs observed in prices of targeted goods as they cross the border may indicate, in line with previous research, that because a lot of U.S. trade with China is invoiced in dollars, prices of U.S. imports from China are sticky in dollars. Depreciation of the Chinese Renmimbi (RMB) against the U.S. dollar over time may offset some of the direct cost of the tariffs for importers. Adjustments in the prices in response to exchange rate fluctuations when prices exhibit stickiness can sometimes take 1-3 years, depending on expectations. Exchange rate adjustment is not a panacea. It does not eliminate all deadweight loss from the tariff because tariffs still distort the prices of goods targeted by the tax relative to goods not targeted. Exchange rate adjustment also does not eliminate the effects of the new policy uncertainty, which may be much larger than the more direct costs of the tariffs.

What this means

Economists across academic and policymaking institutions have produced a number of different estimates of the impact that changes in trade policy since the start of 2018 have had on the U.S. economy. The lowest estimates involve only the direct incidence of the new taxes on consumers.

The highest estimates include the direct costs of the tariffs, costs related to distortions the tariffs generate in firm and household behavior, and the drag on firm activity that increased uncertainty about trade policy has brought.

Taking the full range of estimates into account, the new trade policy regime implemented in 2018 through June 2019 is likely to result in an average cost per U.S. household between $500 and $1,700 a year.","(3, 'inflation')"
321,CNN Poll: Trump's approval rating on the economy hits a new high - CNN,CNN Poll: Trump's approval rating on the economy hits a new high  CNN,"Thu, 02 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAxOS8wNS8wMi9wb2xpdGljcy9jbm4tcG9sbC10cnVtcC1lY29ub215LTIwMjAvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBR2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMTkvMDUvMDIvcG9saXRpY3MvY25uLXBvbGwtdHJ1bXAtZWNvbm9teS0yMDIw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,CNN,"CNN —

President Donald Trump hits a new high on his economic approval ratings in a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS, reaching 56% of Americans saying he’s doing a good job on the economy.

The result comes on the heels of the announcement that the US economy grew at a much better rate than expected in the first quarter, and Trump’s performance on the economy becomes one of his prime selling points for next year’s general election.

Trump’s previous high mark in CNN polling on handling the economy came in March 2017 when 55% approved. Since then, he’s edged above 50% four times, but this is the first time it’s been meaningfully over the 50% line.

White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney spelled out Trump’s 2020 economic message on Tuesday – suggesting voters would still be willing to support the President even if they don’t like him personally.

“You hate to sound like a cliché, but are you better off than you were four years ago? It’s pretty simple, right? It’s the economy, stupid. I think that’s easy. People will vote for somebody they don’t like if they think it’s good for them,” Mulvaney said during a talk at the Milken conference in Los Angeles.

The economy is the President’s best issue tested in the new poll, with his other approval ratings all below 50%. Even among those who disapprove of the way the president is handling his job generally, 20% say they approve of his work on the economy. That’s larger than crossover approval for any other issue by 12 points.

The President’s approval rating on the economy dipped to 48% earlier this year on the heels of the government shutdown. Since then, Trump has improved his ratings on the economy by double-digits among those under age 35 (up 16 points), non-whites (up 13 percentage points), independents (up 11 points), women (up 10 points) and even Democrats (up 10 points).

Trump’s approval on health care policy has improved slightly since June 2018, up five points to 38%, his worst approval rating tested in the poll. Slightly more, 42% approve of how he’s handling immigration and foreign affairs, and 39% approve of his handling of race relations.

His approval on race relations has increased since September 2017 – up 6 percentage points – but the last poll was taken amidst the protesting in the NFL by kneeling, when Trump called for owners to fire protesting players. His increases since 2017 came largely among conservatives, Republicans and whites.

At the same time, Trump’s favorability rating has hit its highest point since the 100-day mark of his presidency: 45% of Americans have a favorable opinion of the President.

More, 54%, continue to hold a negative view. But the latest movement marks a 5-percentage point increase since a December 2018 poll. His largest favorability increases come among independents (up 9 percentage points), those with a college education (9 percentage points) and women (8 percentage points).

Half of Americans say Trump is doing a good job keeping the important promises he made during his presidential campaign, steady from October 2018.

Those numbers on the economy, favorability and promise-keeping – along with the President’s best approval ratings since April 2017 – ought to bode well for his chances in 2020. But head-to-head match-ups with the top Democratic contenders for the nomination in this poll aren’t overwhelmingly positive for the President.

Registered voters in the survey were randomly assigned three of the top six Democratic contenders and asked whether they would be more likely to vote for that person or for Trump in 2020. Support for each Democrat tested ranged from a low of 47% backing South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren over Trump to a high of 52% backing Beto O’Rourke over the president.

Joe Biden (51%), Bernie Sanders (50%) and Kamala Harris (49%) fell in between. Trump’s numbers ranged from 42% to 48%.

Although some of the Democratic contenders do hold a meaningful edge over the President, these results suggest a close race at this point, and there is a lot of time for voters to change their minds. In CNN’s first test of a general election matchup between Trump and Hillary Clinton in June of 2015, Clinton led Trump by 14 points among registered voters.

Although it is very early in the process, some patterns emerged across all these matchups that are worth noting.

Each Democratic candidate topped Trump by a double-digit margin among women, while Trump held an edge among men over each candidate tested. Whites without college degrees broke for Trump in each case, but whites with degrees split, favoring Trump in match-ups with Buttigieg, Warren, Sanders and Biden, but breaking in the Democratic Party’s favor for Harris and O’Rourke.

Harris prompts the largest gap between whites without degrees and those who hold a four-year degree, with a nearly 40-point swing in preferences between the two groups. Non-whites favored the Democratic candidate in each matchup.

The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS April 25 through April 28 among a random national sample of 1,007 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.

Random half-samples can result in smaller subgroup sizes that fall below our minimum for publishing crosstabs for those groups. Members of groups not shown in the published crosstabs are fully represented in the results for each question in the poll. Unweighted sample sizes for registered voters under age 45 for each of the hypothetical 2020 matchups ranged from 111 to 127, for non-white voters they ranged from 107 to 130.","(0, 'GDP')"
322,How has Michigan fared in Trump’s economy? - MLive.com,How has Michigan fared in Trump’s economy?

Wages and salaries are continuing to trend up. The state’s economy is growing.

As President Donald Trump heads into the 2020 presidential campaign, Michigan is a must-win state and one of his strongest arguments for re-election is a booming economy.

“We’ve cut taxes, rolled back regulation,” Vice President Mike Pence said during a recent speech before the Detroit Economic Club. Trump “promised to pursue great trade deals for our country, and to unleash an energy revolution. And three years later, President Donald Trump delivered.""

Fellow Republicans are appreciative. “We’ve seen positive results under Trump,"" said state Sen. Ken Horn, R-Frankenmuth, who chairs the Senate Economic and Small Business Development Committee.

Others disagree. Despite strong employment and rising wages, Trump’s economic policies have resulted in “a very mixed record” for Michigan, said Charles Ballard, an economist at Michigan State University.

“I would say it has to be almost certainly has to be a net minus,” based on what’s happened so far, said Alan Deardorff, an economist at University of Michigan. “But it will be quite a while before we’re going to have data to really know the impact.”

The two economists readily acknowledge the overall economy is strong. The United States is now in the 10th year of economic growth, the longest expansion since 1854.

But that’s essentially building on gains started under Obama, both Ballard and Deardorff said, adding the rate of growth in Michigan’s economy has actually slowed a bit by some measures.

In fact, on a number of measures of economic activity, increases in the final years of the Obama presidency outpaced the first years under Trump, based on federal statistics.

Michigan employment increased by about 111,300 jobs in the first 30 months of the Trump presidency. That compares to almost 205,000 in the last 30 months of the Obama administration.

The state added about 17,600 manufacturing jobs in the first 30 months under Trump compared to about 36,000 in the last 30 months under Obama.

Michigan unemployment rate was 4.9% when Trump took office. It’s currently 4.3%. In the last 30 months of the Obama presidency, the unemployment rate went from 7% to 4.9%.

Michigan’s average weekly wage rose 3.4% during the first two years under Trump, and was $1,078 for the first quarter of 2019. The average weekly wage rose 7.6% during the last two years of Obama’s presidency.

Michigan’s gross domestic product grew 7.7% in the first two years under Trump compared to 9.1% during the last two years under Obama.

One measure where Trump’s numbers look better is median wages, the number where half earn more and half earn less. In the most recent data, Michigan’s median weekly wage for full-time workers was $732.20 in May 2018, up 2.6% from May 2017. That’s the biggest one-year increase since 2005.

One reason Obama’s numbers look better is the state’s economy had plenty of room to grow after the recession. On the other hand, the numbers show most of Michigan’s recovery occurred under Obama, not Trump.

Ballard said the Republicans’ 2017 tax cut, which he termed as Trump’s “signature accomplishment” so far, seems to have helped to provide a “bit of a boost in 2018.""

But Ballard also characterized the tax cut as a “sugar high” with temporary impact. “You can’t expect that to have lasting big effects, because we were already pretty close to full employment,” he said. “Unemployment is not going to go down to 1%.""

Moreover, Ballard said, the tax cut was structured to benefit corporations and wealthy residents the most. “The rhetoric was that this was to lead to job growth, but don’t insult my intelligence,” he said. “It was to put money into the pockets of big corporations and directly or indirectly help help people with large stock market portfolios.”

And as it happens, the benefits of the tax cut for ordinary citizens is being offset by tax increases related to tariffs and Trump’s trade policy, another signature issue for the president.

The middle fifth of earners averaged a $780 tax cut for 2018, according to the Tax Policy Center. Meanwhile, tariffs are currently costing the average American household about $600 per year and that could rise to $1,000 per household if Trump carries through on his threat to increase tariffs on Chinese imports, according to an analysis by JPMorgan Chase.

“In my view, the possibility of a recession has been substantially increased by the trade war,” Ballard said.

Deardorff agreed the trade war has been a net negative for the economy. “All the states are losing from the tariffs in both directions, because they are making the supply chain of everything we produce and everything we buy more expensive,"" he said.

Kristin Dziczek, a vice president for the Center for Automotive Research Center in Ann Arbor, said the trade war has not been good for Michigan, where the auto industry is the state’s biggest economic driver.

“Everything is up in the air"" on trade, she said. “I can’t see that as a positive. ... It’s really puts a chill on investment.""

Steel tariffs in particular have increased costs for the U.S. automakers.

“Both Ford and General Motors cited that just the metals tariffs were costing them a billion dollars more a year on import prices for steel and aluminum,” Dziczek said. “Those have been removed on Canada and Mexico, but not on everybody else yet. That’s a big relief, but it’s not total relief from those tariffs.”

That’s combined with the “great uncertainty"" about the United States-Mexico-Canadian Agreement or USMCA, the NAFTA replacement yet to be ratified by Congress, as well as “great uncertainty” about future tariffs, she said.

Especially worrisome, she said, is Trump’s threat to impose additional tariffs on autos and auto parts from Japan and/or the European Union if the U.S. fails to reach new trade agreements by mid-November.

“That would have a much bigger impact” than what’s happened so far in the trade war, Dziczek said.

Her organization released a study in February to look at the impact of U.S. trade policies. In their worst-case scenario, USMCA is implemented in its current form; other tariffs “continue unmodified,” and Trump imposes tariffs on autos and auto parts for countries other than Canada, Mexico and South Korea.

In that event, the analysis estimated a loss of 367,000 U.S. jobs and an average price increase of $2,750 per car or light truck.

“That’s a real concern,” she said.

Dziczek, Ballard and Deardorff differ in their take on whether Michigan would be helped or hurt if the USMCA replaces NAFTA.

Ballard said the differences between the two agreements are minor, saying “it’s not even NAFTA 2.0. It’s NAFTA 1.1.""

Deardorff and Dziczek point to USMCA incentives that would encourage more auto production in the U.S.: Deardorff says that would hurt Michigan by increasing production costs; Dziczek takes the opposite stance, saying, “Michigan has a great shot” at getting some of those new jobs.

While Trump’s rollback of federal regulations has been credited as business-friendly move, that’s not necessary true in the auto industry -- specifically in terms of the current battle over gas mileage standards.

Trump has rolled back vehicle mileage standards adopted by the Obama administration. But California and 22 other states are seeking to keep the higher standards for vehicles sold in their states.

“Complying with new regulations on fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions involves investment,” Dziczek said. “And that investment is sitting on the sidelines, waiting to find out how all this is going to be resolved.”

Michael LaFaive, a fiscal policy expert for the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a free-market think tank in Midland, said he’s enthusiastic about the Republican cut tax and Trump’s loosening of federal regulations. But he worries that’s being offset by the trade war, especially in Michigan where so much of the economy is tied to international trade.

“When you change trade policy, there are going to be winners and losers,” he said. “But on the balance, tariffs are just a tax on ourselves. And that’s playing itself out now.”

Like Deardorff, LaFaive said it’s too early to tell if Trump’s economy policies are a net negative or positive for Michigan.

“There are so many moving parts, and I don’t know how to tease out the impact of Donald Trump’s policies on the balance,"" he said. ""Obviously, I’m not pleased with these tariffs. They may be doing more harm than good. But there’s also the regulatory pullback. I don’t know how to factor all that in.

“I’d like to see how it all washes out,” he said.","(1, 'employment/wages')"

That’s a slowdown from 4.2 percent GDP growth in the previous three months, but a solid gain and the latest sign of stable economic productivity.

The latest figures give President Donald Trump — who has frequently promised at least 4 percent GDP growth– something to point to as evidence that his policies are helping the economy. Trump has also credited the GOP tax law with boosting economic growth.

The GDP report also comes at a good time for Trump and Republicans, as the party fights to hold onto control of the House and Senate in the midterm elections. The report was one of the last major economic indicators before Election Day (there will be one more jobs report released Nov. 2).

But none of this is unexpected.

As the chart below shows, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the U.S. economy would grow 3.3 percent this year. That estimate seems right on track: the economy has grown by an average of 3.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2018.

Two of the main reasons for the boost are a rise in government defense spending, as well as consumer spending, which jumped 4 percent in the third quarter. Americans are buying more because of increasing wages, a lower unemployment rate and the new tax law Trump signed in December that slashed corporate taxes and lowered income tax rates for many individuals.

“When tax cuts put money in people’s pockets, they are likely to spend it,” said William Gale, the co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

Americans are expected to see their taxes reduced by $1,600 on average this year, with most of those cuts going to households making between $308,000 and $733,000, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.

But there is a big difference in how tax cuts affect economic growth in the short run versus the long run, Gale added.

The chart indicates that real GDP growth (“real” means adjusted for inflation) is expected to drop significantly in the long run.

The Congressional Budget Office points to several reasons for that: the expiration of personal income tax cuts, slower growth in federal spending, and higher interest rates and prices.

The individual tax cuts in the GOP law are set to end in 2025, although Republicans have proposed making them permanent.

The other main problem is that gap you see in the chart between GDP (the amount the economy is actually producing) and potential GDP (what an economy could produce when it is operating at its highest potential).

Real GDP can be higher than real potential GDP if the economy gets extra stimulus from government spending or tax cuts.

But higher real GDP is good, right? Well, not always, because having GDP growth above potential GDP typically leads to higher prices, also known as inflation. If inflation isn’t kept in check, it can feed on itself in an upward spiral — what’s known as wage-price inflation.

Gale compared that stimulus to having too much coffee.

Trump has said the Federal Reserve is the biggest risk to the U.S. economy.

“If you are tired in the afternoon, that will get you through the rest of the day, but a steady diet of sugar and caffeine is not healthy,” he said.

The last time inflation spiked in the 1970s, it led to the Federal Reserve hitting the brakes hard on economic growth, and a sharp recession followed.

The Federal Reserve typically tries to steer a middle course between runaway growth that fuels inflation and slow growth that doesn’t create enough jobs. Right now, the Fed is raising interest rates to keep inflation in check, a clear sign of concern the economy could overheat. (In a series of unusual attacks, Trump has denounced the Fed’s recent rate hikes and claimed the central bank is the “biggest risk” to the U.S. economy.)

Conservative analysts said they weren’t too worried about inflation because the new tax law is meant to encourage investment, not just spending.

“If businesses are investing in new pieces of equipment, it is making them more efficient and that can lead to lower prices on the widget that is being produced,” said Adam Michel, a economic and fiscal policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation.

In the end, simultaneous spikes in investment and consumer spending could balance each other out, leaving the price of most goods largely unchanged.

But that assumes companies will invest their tax cuts in new equipment and facilities. So far, much of the money from the tax cuts is not going directly to investments, but instead to stock buybacks, something Democrats predicted in their opposition of the bill.

There is another threat to future real GDP growth as well: tariffs. Exports spiked in the second quarter because producers were trying to sell their products before the Trump administration’s new tariffs — on goods like steel and electronics from China and other countries — kicked in. Those exports dropped in the third quarter and could continue to drop if the tariffs remain in place.

The upshot: the overall economy remains strong, for now. Unemployment is low. Wages are starting to tick up. The question is how long it can last.","(0, 'GDP')"

From trade tensions to the unemployment rate, Powell’s comments to lawmakers in the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday and the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday stood in contrast to the statements Trump has repeatedly made on Twitter, at rallies and to reporters.

Here’s a closer look at three specific issues on which Trump and Powell disagree.

Why a rate cut might be needed

Powell pleased investors Wednesday when he signaled the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates in the near future, something Trump has also called for in recent months. But Trump and Powell disagree about why those cuts might be needed.

Trump has said the Federal Reserve raised interest rates too quickly during the economic recovery following the Great Recession, slowing growth.

In his testimony, Powell pointed to a slowdown in global growth and U.S. trade tensions — with China and key U.S. allies such as the European Union — as reasons why the Fed’s view of the economy has turned more pessimistic in recent months.

Powell cautioned that his statements should not be construed as criticism of the president’s policies, but he indicated the trade disputes Trump has started with other nations are significant drags on U.S. business investment.

“Apparent progress on trade turned to greater uncertainty, and our contacts in business and agriculture report heightened concerns over trade developments,” Powell said in his opening statement Wednesday.

Powell largely avoided mentioning Trump by name, but his message was clear.

“Uncertainty is a synonym for ‘Trump is unsettling the business community,’ and the Fed never sees uncertainty as its friend,” said David Wessel, a senior economic fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution.

On Thursday, Powell said tariffs have also had a negative effect on home building, which can hurt housing affordability in the long-term.

U.S. and Chinese representatives have continued negotiations on a deal to end the trade war, but no meaningful agreements to reduce tariffs have been announced.

Trump takes a very different view of his trade policies. He has said the tariffs he has put into place, especially against China, have boosted the economy.

Even if Powell disagrees with the president on tariffs, he appears poised to counter their negative effects by adjusting monetary policy. But that might not help years down the road. Cutting interest rates is a way to help boost demand in the short-term, said Stan Veuger, a scholar with the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington-based think tank.

For Trump, who is seeking reelection next year, a drop in interest rates might be enough to keep the economy afloat through 2020, but the longer-term consequences are less clear.

“The Fed is basically incentivizing these damaging trade policies by assuming they are temporary,” Veuge said.

Minority unemployment

Trump has often pointed to the historically low unemployment rate for black and Hispanic Americans as a sign of how his economic policies have benefited all Americans.

Trump tweeted Thursday that “Nearly one million more blacks and two million more Hispanics are employed than when Barrack Obama left office,” quoting a Wall Street Journal op-ed but misspelling the former president’s first name.

Black and Hispanic Americans have seen significant job gains under Trump, but the gains began during the Obama administration.

In June, the national unemployment rate for black Americans was 6 percent and the rate for Hispanic Amerians was 4.3 percent. Both numbers are near record-lows.

But the unemployment rate for black Americans was 7.9 percent when Trump took office, down from a peak of 16.8 percent during the aftermath of the Great Recession. Likewise, the unemployment rate for Hispanic Americans was 5.9 percent in December 2016, down from a peak of 12.9 percent in 2010.

As Powell pointed out in his testimony Wednesday, the black and Hispanic rates are still relatively high compared to other demographic groups — a cause for concern.

The unemployment rate for all Amerians was 3.7 percent in June. It was 3.3 percent for white Americans and 2.1 percent for Asian Americans.

“The benefits of a strong job market have been more widely shared in recent years,” Powell said. “Indeed, wage gains have been higher for lower-skilled workers. That said, individuals in some demographic groups and in some parts of the country continue to face challenges.”

Powell also mentioned that people in urban areas are doing better financially than those in rural areas. Notably, rural voters were key to Trump’s 2016 election victory, supporting him over Hillary Clinton by a 45-percent margin in the most rural areas.

The Federal Reserve plays a minimal role in addressing economic inequality, so any efforts to make a real dent in the disparity would fall to the White House, which, so far, has relied largely on the idea that a stronger economy benefits all Americans, including minorities.

Returning to the gold standard

In 2016, Trump advocated for returning to the gold standard — linking the value of the dollar to the price of gold. The U.S. moved away from the gold standard during the Great Depression, because the financial crisis caused too many people to hoard gold making it difficult to exchange dollars for gold.

It is unclear whether Trump himself supports returning to the gold standard now, but last month, Trump nominated Judy Shelton, a supporter of the gold standard, to the Federal Reserve Board.

Powell, who emphasized that his comments were not directed at the Fed nominee, said Wednesday that if the U.S. tied the dollar to the price of gold it would shift the Federal Reserve’s mission and force it to largely disregard other important economic factors such as the unemployment rate.

“I don’t think that is something that would be attractive. No other country uses” the gold standard, Powell said.

Why Trump and Powell’s disagreements matter

Past presidents have disagreed at times with their Fed chairs, and don’t often shift their economic plans based on what the Fed is saying.

In fact, Powell emphasized in his testimony that it is his job to respond to how the economy is affected by the president’s policies. It is not his job to influence the White House.

Trump’s views stand in greater contrast with Powell because the president does not take his advice from mainstream economists.

But past presidents have at least generally agreed with the Fed on major economic principles.

Trump’s views stand in greater contrast with Powell because the president does not take his advice from mainstream economists and often intentionally creates chaos as a negotiating tactic, Wessel said.

That makes Powell’s job more difficult as he tries to counter the negative effects that unpredictability injects into the economy.

Despite Powell’s disagreements with Trump, Republicans and Democrats alike appeared to back Powell during the hearings, complimenting him on his leadership and on maintaining his independence from political influences.

“To the extent that Congress is bowing to Jay Powell or endorsing him, it gives him more stature in case something goes wrong,” Wessel said.","(3, 'inflation')"
332,Trump's Economic Falsehoods - FactCheck.org,Trump's Economic Falsehoods  FactCheck.org,"Fri, 15 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhY3RjaGVjay5vcmcvMjAxOS8xMS90cnVtcHMtZWNvbm9taWMtZmFsc2Vob29kcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,FactCheck.org,"President Donald Trump rattled off several false claims in his Nov. 12 speech to the Economic Club of New York, in which he contrasted the supposedly “bleak” outlook at the end of his predecessor’s term with an exaggerated portrayal of the economy’s strong performance during his own tenure.

He said that when he was running for president in 2016 “America was stuck in a failed recovery and saddled with a bleak economic future. And it was bleak.” But as we wrote at the time he took office, “President Trump actually inherits an economy experiencing steady if unspectacular growth in output, jobs and incomes.” We noted that the economy had added 2.2 million jobs in the 12 months before Trump took office. That was later revised upward to nearly 2.5 million.

In his speech, Trump said: “Under the last administration, nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs had been lost.” That’s true enough; the loss was 193,000. But the number of manufacturing jobs had increased by more than 900,000 between the low point early in Barack Obama’s first term and the time Trump took office. And Trump failed to mention that total employment grew by 11.6 million under Obama.

Trump claimed that under Obama, “almost 5 million more Americans had left the labor force.” Not true. In fact, the civilian labor force grew by nearly 5.5 million under Obama.

The president said that “jobs were not exactly what you would call plentiful” under Obama. That’s also far from true. In March 2016 the number of unfilled job openings hit 6.1 million, the highest in the more than 15 years records had been kept. And when Trump took office, the number of unfilled jobs was still 5.6 million.

Trump said that in 2016, “the Department of Labor predicted that Americans would continue dropping out of the workforce in record numbers.” But that’s another falsehood. The Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics projection for 2016-2028 (actually issued in December 2015) was that the labor force would continue to grow — though at a slower pace because the population was aging and many were reaching retirement age.



BLS said then: “The labor force is anticipated to grow by 7.9 million, reflecting an average annual growth rate of 0.5 percent, over the 2014–24 period.” And despite Trump’s bragging, that outlook for 0.5% growth hasn’t changed. The most recent BLS 10-year projection says: “The labor force is projected to increase at an annual rate of 0.5 percent from 2018 to 2028.”

Trump said that before he took office, “[T]hey expected unemployment over 5% — and, really, 6, 7, and even, in some cases, 8% — for many years to come.” Not so. The Congressional Budget Office projected in August 2016 that unemployment would fall to 4.5% in 2017, and wouldn’t exceed 5% for the following decade.

That was in line with most economic forecasts. The median projection issued Dec. 14, 2016, by Federal Reserve Board members and Federal Reserve Bank presidents was for a 4.5% unemployment rate in 2017, 2018 and 2019. And of 50 economists who offered a projection of the unemployment rate in the Wall Street Journal’s economic survey in November 2016, the average expectation was for a 4.6% unemployment rate in December 2018. Only two of the respondents thought the rate would be over 5%.

Trump claimed in his speech that “my administration has created nearly 7 million jobs, and going up rapidly.” This is exaggerated. Total employment has gone up by 6.25 million since Trump took office, well short of 7 million. As for “going up rapidly,” the average monthly gain for the most recent 12 months has been 174,000. That’s actually slower growth than during the 12 months before Trump took office, when the average monthly job gain was 207,000.

It’s true that job gains under Trump have exceeded what economists expected in 2016, but not by as much as he claimed in his speech. He said that “before I took office, the Congressional Budget Office projected that fewer than 2 million jobs would be created by this time in 2019.” And indeed, CBO’s 10-year economic projection in August 2016 was that total nonfarm employment would be 1.9 million higher in the fourth quarter of 2019 than in the fourth quarter of 2016. But Trump fails to note that CBO had revised that estimate upward just as he was taking office. On Jan. 24, 2017, it projected that the job gain would be 3.3 million.

So Trump would be justified in saying that during his tenure so far the economy produced nearly twice as many jobs as CBO predicted at the time he took office. But he was wrong to claim in his speech that the gain “beat predictions more than three times.”

Trump said: “Last year, GDP growth matched the fastest rate in more than a decade.” That’s true enough. In 2018, real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product increased by 2.9% over the previous year, matching the 2.9% growth in 2015, the only other time in the past 10 years growth has been that high. But growth has slowed since then to an annual rate of 1.9% in the third quarter of this year. And of course, Trump had promised to do better than merely matching the best year of Obama’s presidency. He repeatedly promised growth of 4% to 6% per year, both when he was a candidate and also as president.

Trump repeated one of his favorite talking points, claiming that median household income has gone up $5,000 during his time. But as we reported earlier, that’s a shaky claim based on estimates produced from a survey that isn’t designed to measure income. The Census Bureau’s measure of median household income increased $1,400 (after adjusting for inflation), or 2.3%, during Trump’s first two years in office. Indications are that the figure has risen further during 2019, but by how much won’t be known until September 2020, when Census is due to release the 2019 figure.

There’s no question the economy has been strong since Trump took office, but it was also strong before he took office, a fact he continues to distort as he falsely puffs up his own record.","(0, 'GDP')"
333,Trump threatens to 'destroy' Turkey's economy with sanctions - The Associated Press,Trump threatens to 'destroy' Turkey's economy with sanctions  The Associated Press,"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3N5cmlhLXR1cmtleS1yb2JlcnQtb2JyaWVuLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtbmV3cy1kb25hbGQtdHJ1bXAtNzY3MDU0ZjFmOTlmNDAxOTlhODBiZmVhOGUxNmNjZGbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Associated Press,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Targeting Turkey’s economy, President Donald Trump announced sanctions aimed at restraining the Turks’ assault against Kurdish fighters and civilians in Syria — an assault Turkey began after Trump announced he was moving U.S. troops out of the way.

Some of those U.S. troops leaving northern Syria are being shifted to Iraq, where they could conduct cross-border operations against Islamic State group militants, a U.S. official said.

The United States also called on Turkey to stop the invasion and declare a cease-fire, and Trump is sending Vice President Mike Pence and national security adviser Robert O’Brien to Ankara as soon as possible in an attempt to begin negotiations. Pence said on Monday that Trump spoke directly to Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who promised not to attack the border town of Kobani, which in 2015 witnessed the Islamic State group’s first defeat in a battle by U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters.

“President Trump communicated to him very clearly that the United States of America wants Turkey to stop the invasion, implement an immediate cease-fire and to begin to negotiate with Kurdish forces in Syria to bring an end to the violence,” Pence said.

The Americans were scrambling for Syria’s exits, a move criticized at home and abroad as opening the door to a resurgence of the Islamic State group, whose violent takeover of Syrian and Iraqi lands five years ago was the reason American forces went in the first place.

Trump said the approximately 1,000 U.S. troops who had been partnering with local Kurdish fighters to battle the Islamic State in northern Syria are leaving the country. They will remain in the Middle East, he said, to “monitor the situation” and to prevent a revival of IS — a goal that even Trump’s allies say has become much more difficult as a result of the U.S. pullout.

The U.S. troops being withdrawn from northern Syria will reposition in Iraq, Kuwait and possibly Jordan, according to the U.S. official, who spoke to The Associated Press on Tuesday on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive planning for the U.S. pullout.

The official said the American troops have pulled out of the Manbij area, where U.S. outposts were set up in 2017. Troops are consolidating their positions to prepare to fly out of the country soon.

The official said the U.S. troops in Iraq could perform operations against the IS militants in Syria as they did before creating the now-abandoned partnership with Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.

The Turks began attacks in Syria last week against the Syrian Kurdish fighters, whom the Turks see as terrorists. On Monday, Syrian government troops moved north toward the border region, setting up a potential clash with Turkish-led forces.

Trump said Turkey’s invasion is “precipitating a humanitarian crisis and setting conditions for possible war crimes,” a reference to reports of Turkish-backed fighters executing Kurdish fighters on the battlefield.

The Kurdish forces previously allied with the U.S. said they had reached a deal with President Bashar Assad’s government to help them fend off Turkey’s invasion, a move that brings Russian forces deeper into the conflict.

In his sanctions announcement, Trump said he was halting negotiations on a $100 billion trade deal with Turkey and raising steel tariffs back up to 50%. Trump also imposed sanctions on three senior Turkish officials and Turkey’s defense and energy ministries.

“I am fully prepared to swiftly destroy Turkey’s economy if Turkish leaders continue down this dangerous and destructive path,” Trump said.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the sanctions will hurt an already weak Turkish economy. Pence said the U.S. will continue to ramp up the sanctions “unless Turkey is willing to embrace a cease-fire, come to the negotiating table and end the violence.”

American troops consolidated their positions in northern Syria on Monday and prepared to evacuate equipment in advance of a full withdrawal, a U.S. defense official said.

The official, who was not authorized to be quoted by name, said U.S. officials were weighing options for a potential future counter-IS campaign, including the possibility of waging it with a combination of air power and special operations forces based outside Syria, perhaps in Iraq.

The hurried preparations for a U.S. exit were triggered by Trump’s decision Saturday to expand a limited troop pullout into a complete withdrawal.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Monday he would travel to NATO headquarters in Brussels next week to urge European allies to impose “diplomatic and economic measures” against Turkey, a fellow NATO ally, for what Esper called Ankara’s “egregious” actions.

Esper said Turkey’s incursion had created unacceptable risk to U.S. forces in northern Syria and “we also are at risk of being engulfed in a broader conflict.”

The only exception to the U.S. withdrawal from Syria is a group of perhaps 200 troops who will remain at a base called Tanf in southern Syria near the Jordanian border along the strategically important Baghdad-to-Damascus highway. Those troops work with Syrian opposition forces unrelated to the Kurdish-led fighters in northern Syria.

Esper said the U.S. withdrawal would be done carefully to protect the troops and to ensure no U.S. equipment was left behind. He declined to say how long that might take.

In a series of tweets Monday, Trump defended his gamble that pulling U.S. forces out of Syria would not weaken U.S. security and credibility. He took sarcastic swipes at critics who say his Syria withdrawal amounts to a betrayal of the Kurds and plays into the hands of Russia.

“Anyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte,” he wrote. “I hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!”

Trump has dug in on his decision to pull out the troops, believing it fulfills a key campaign promise and will be a winning issue in the 2020 election, White House officials say.

This has effectively ended a five-year effort to partner with Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters to ensure a lasting defeat of the Islamic State group. Hundreds of IS supporters escaped a holding camp amid clashes between invading Turkish-led forces and Kurdish fighters, and analysts said an IS resurgence seemed more likely, just months after Trump declared the extremists defeated.

Trump spoke about the IS detainees in a phone call Monday with Kurdish General Mazloum Kobani. Pence said Mazloum assured the Republican president that Kurdish forces would continue to support the prisons holding IS fighters.

Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell, normally a staunch Trump supporter, said he was “gravely concerned” by events in Syria and Trump’s response.

Withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria “would re-create the very conditions that we have worked hard to destroy and invite the resurgence of ISIS,” he said in a statement.

New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Trump is weakening America.

“To be clear, this administration’s chaotic and haphazard approach to policy by tweet is endangering the lives of U.S. troops and civilians,” Menendez said in a statement.

The Kurds have turned to the Syrian government and Russia for military assistance. The prospect of enhancing the Syrian government’s position on the battlefield and inviting Russia to get more directly involved is seen by Trump’s critics as a major mistake.

334,Half-million fewer jobs: Revisions hit Trump economy - NBC News,Half-million fewer jobs: Revisions hit Trump economy  NBC News,"Sun, 25 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL21lZXQtdGhlLXByZXNzL2hhbGYtbWlsbGlvbi1mZXdlci1qb2JzLXJldmlzaW9ucy1oaXQtdHJ1bXAtZWNvbm9teS1uMTA0NjE1NtIBLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYW1wL25jbmExMDQ2MTU2?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,NBC News,"WASHINGTON--Throughout Donald Trump’s turbulent presidency, the economy has served as a stabilizer. His economic approval numbers are consistently higher than his overall job approval in polls and he’s made his economic stewardship a top reelection talking point.

“You have no choice but to vote for me because your 401(k), everything is going to be down the tubes,” he told a crowd in New Hampshire earlier this month. “Whether you love me or hate me, you’ve got to vote for me.”

But recent headlines and new sets of data are raising questions about exactly where the economy is heading as 2020 approaches. Increasingly it looks like the president’s stabilizer is headed for some bumpy times.

To start with, it appears some of the nation’s good economic times have not been as good as we thought they were.

New revised numbers this week from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed job-creation estimates had been off by about 20 percent. The data showed that about 2 million jobs were created between April 2018 and March 2019. That is 500,000 fewer jobs than the estimates had originally shown.

That's not recession territory, of course — growth is growth — but it is not good. And there are similar patterns elsewhere in the numbers.

The numbers for Gross Domestic Product were also revised down earlier this year.

Another look at GDP earlier this summer from the Commerce Department, showed that U.S. economy grew at a 2.5 percent clip for 2018, rather than the 3.0 number that was first announced. That was a blow to the administration, which had celebrated the 3.0 number as a breakthrough not seen since 2005. The 2.5 number was lower than 2017’s 2.8 percent and also below annual figures for 2014 and 2013.

Estimates for future GDP growth are lower still. The 2019 estimate is currently at 2.3 percent growth, with the 2020 number at 2.1 percent, according to a new report from the Congressional Budget Office.

And this summer has brought fresh concerns about what’s coming.

The U.S. economy is largely being propelled by consumer spending and August saw a sharp dip in the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index compared to July.

The drop to 92.1 from 98.4 was largely driven by concerns about where the economy was headed, but that “clouds on the horizon” forecast has been driving a lot of the economic unease and not without reason. Some reliable measures for the economy’s future health have turned negative in recent weeks.

Maybe most concerning for the White House, on Thursday the Purchasing Manger’s Index of U.S. manufacturing slipped into contraction territory for the first time in almost a decade. The August measure, 44.9, is just a tick under the number 50, which shows no growth.

To be fair that’s a slim difference and that manufacturing number could bounce back in months to come, but the trend over the past few months is unmistakably down.

That drop is a special concern to team Trump because of who takes the hit on it. The president ran on a lot of ideas in 2016, but one of the boldest was a promise to reinvigorate manufacturing in the United States.

Manufacturing makes up a crucial part of the economies in the three states that ultimately won Trump the presidency: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And all those states have seen manufacturing employment declines over the last six months.

What's going on in all these numbers? Some of this may just be bumps in the road. Even good economic times aren’t uniformly good. The global economic slowdown may have something to do with the dips. The United States is not immune from larger global forces. And, of course, the president's trade disputes are likely playing a role.

Regardless of the reason, however, these numbers are going to be an important part of the 2020 landscape.

Economists and analysts will rightly note that the U.S. economy is still growing, but to some extent, that’s beside the point. Much of the economy is psychological. It's less about the numbers than how people feel about the numbers. After months and years of positive trends, an economic slowdown can feel like economic anxiety. That could present a challenge for the president in 2020.

Up to now the economy has been the bright spot that Trump could boast because most Americans seemed to feel pretty good about the economy. But these numbers suggest that picture wasn’t as sunny as we believed it was and it may be considerably more cloudy in the months ahead.","(0, 'GDP')"

On Friday, the Labor Department announced that the economy added 263,000 jobs and hourly wages grew by two-tenths of a percent in April. The unemployment rate — 3.6 percent — is at its lowest level since December 1969, before the births of nine of the Democrats running for his job.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average index of top stocks has been hovering near its record high in recent days, gross domestic product rose by 3.2 percent in the first quarter, and while some Democratic candidates are making the case that income inequality means that most Americans aren't feeling real benefits from the big numbers, that message is competing both with the broader figures and other topics.

Trump's allies see a president who is competently leading the country in the right direction on jobs and the economy, the issues that typically matter most to voters, and a Democratic Party arguing for a 180-degree pivot at its own peril.

""While Democrats are turning toward socialism and are wasting time attacking the president, the American economy is booming due to President Trump's tax cuts and deregulatory policies,"" said Boris Epshteyn, the chief political commentator for Sinclair Broadcast Group and a former special assistant to Trump in the White House.

""Fifty-year low unemployment, over 3 percent GDP growth, and a strong rise in wages are resulting in the over 55 percent approval rating for the president on the economy,"" he said in a text exchange with NBC News. ""Going into 2020, the Trump economy is putting Democrats in an impossible position of trying to come up with ways they could do better.""

Under normal circumstances, a president riding these economic numbers would be coasting toward a sweeping re-election.

But Trump's overall approval ratings have been consistently low, his matchup scores against potential Democratic rivals have been consistently unimpressive and his unwillingness to use his bully pulpit to keep the electorate focused on the good news for him remains almost inexplicable in traditional political terms.

""If Trump were to spend just one day a week and hammer the job numbers home, time and pressure would cause him to break through to move his approval rating upward,"" said Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist at Rokk Solutions who helped guide Neil Gorsuch's Supreme Court confirmation.

""In order to politically leverage record job growth and unemployment, Trump has to spend time focusing on talking about them at a sustained level,"" Bonjean said over e-mail. ""While most presidents would spend every waking moment hyping this good news, Trump isn’t going to follow the manual. He will likely go for grabbing unrelated headlines because he enjoys that power.""

The opportunity for Trump to use the economy to lift his fortunes may be there if only he seizes it — and if the economy continues to move on a positive track.

Trump's approval rating on the economy rose to 56 percent, according to a CNN poll released this week, and his overall number was up to 45 percent. But in the majority of recent surveys of head-to-head matchups, Trump is trailing most of his top potential Democratic rivals.

But the Trump campaign, which is determined to bring new voters into the process to expand its coalition, has betrayed no concern about his approval numbers in independent polling.

Kayleigh McEnany, the campaign's spokeswoman, said Friday that the president has a better story to tell than his opponents.

""With this kind of momentum, we look forward to hearing the economic plans of the Democrats as they spin tales about Americans not feeling the results of the Trump economy, when in fact workers everywhere can feel the boom!"" she said in a statement.

Mick Mulvaney, Trump's acting chief of staff and a former Republican House member from South Carolina, said Tuesday that a strong economy could override Americans' concerns about the president's personal conduct.

""People will vote for somebody they don't like if they think it is good for them,"" Mulvaney said in remarks made at a conference.

There were signs of reluctance among Democrats to discuss the economic numbers Friday. None of the top Democratic candidates — Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris or Pete Buttigieg — had tweeted about them as of noon.

Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis said Democrats need to tackle Trump head-on by pointing to the gap between the overall economic numbers and the experience of American workers who don't feel that their wages or keeping up or that their savings can withstand disruptions.

""The smart focus for Democrats is what real people are going through, not the fixation on unemployment numbers,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""They see this profound income inequality that is paralyzing them. That is the true story of this economy. That is what Trump doesn’t want to talk about, and that is what Democrats need to talk about.""

Some of the Democratic candidates, particularly Warren and Sanders, have made income inequality and related issues the central focus of their campaigns. And Democrats won a House majority in the 2018 midterms primarily by campaigning against Republican efforts to dismantle Obamacare and its guarantee that insurance policies cover pre-existing medical conditions — a major financial issue for millions of Americans.

But it's far from the only issue Democrats are talking about — impeachment has been an obsession of late for their party — and that dilutes their ability to counter Trump's narrative about the economy.

While the economy is unpredictable and it will be 18 months before voters render a decision on Trump, no one disputes that the good numbers are better for him than the opposite. The big questions are whether the trend can continue, and whether he can take advantage of it.","(0, 'GDP')"

Experts continue to debate the conflicting signals, but an equally telling question might be: How does the “Trump economy” compare to Barack Obama’s? President Trump constantly refers to the economy with descriptors such as “strong,” “terrific” and the “greatest in the history of our country,” but a closer look at the data shows a mixed picture in terms of whether the economy is any better than it was in Obama’s final years. The economy is growing at about the same pace as it did in Obama’s last years, and unemployment, while lower under Trump, has continued a trend that began in 2011.

The best case Trump can make for improvement since he took office is higher wages. The typical American worker’s pay is finally growing more than 3 percent a year, a level not seen since before the Great Recession. Similarly, consumer and business confidence surged after Trump’s election and has remained high, and manufacturing output (and jobs) also saw a noticeable jump in 2018 after Trump’s tax cut, although manufacturing is now struggling. There’s also been a drop in the number of Americans on food stamps.

But in other areas, Trump’s record does not look as rosy. Government debt and the trade deficit are climbing (while most economists don’t worry about the rising trade deficit, Trump made it a central part of his 2016 election campaign), and business investment is faltering as corporate leaders say they are wary of Trump’s trade war. The number of Americans lacking health insurance is also ticking up slightly.

As for two of Trump’s favorite metrics — stocks and jobs — there is a case to be made that those looked better under Obama, although most economists expected job gains to slow now that the economic recovery is a decade old.

Presidents have only so much control over the economy, but how voters perceive economic conditions and their personal finances can play a key role in how they vote. Lately, Republicans and many wealthy voters rate this economy as the best since the 1990s boom, while Democrats and many lower-income voters are less enthusiastic.

Here’s a look at the Trump economy vs. the Obama economy in 15 charts.

1. Job gains. The U.S. economy typically added more than 250,000 jobs each month in 2014 and 227,000 a month in 2015. Trump has not been able to top that yet, but experts say job growth remains surprisingly robust, especially given how many baby boomers are retiring and how many business owners complain they can’t find any more workers.

2. Unemployment rate. The nation’s unemployment rate is at a half-century low, a source of pride for Trump. But many economists have pointed out that the rate has been falling steadily since 2011, making it difficult to see much difference after Trump took office.

3. Growth. After a painful 2009, the economy has been growing for a decade. In the early years of the recovery, growth was lackluster, but it started to pick up in 2014 and 2015. Trump told America he could do even better as president, but his record so far looks similar to Obama’s final few years in office. While his tax cut and deregulatory push boosted growth in 2018, that appears to be fading as business owners grow concerned about the trade war.

4. Middle-class income. Most Americans saw a noticeable decline in their income during the Great Recession, and it took years for wages to recover. In 2017, a typical middle-class family finally saw their income climb above where it was in 1999. (Data for 2018 will be released in September.) Incomes have been rising steadily in recent years as more Americans get jobs.

5. Stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 46 percent at this point in Obama’s presidency vs. 25 percent for Trump. Stocks soared under Obama, and he ended his White House tenure with one of the best gains of any president in modern history. Trump started out with a lot of love from Wall Street as well, especially with his tax cut, but stocks have moved sideways since he began his trade war.

6. Food stamps. About 1 out of 7 Americans received food stamps (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) in 2013 in the aftermath of the Great Recession, as people struggled to find good-paying jobs again. The numbers came down slightly under Obama, and the decline has accelerated under Trump as more Americans have obtained jobs and the requirements to remain on food stamps have tightened.

7. Manufacturing. Trump campaigned heavily on reviving blue-collar industries and jobs. While service-sector jobs in health care, technology and hospitality rebounded quickly after the Great Recession, manufacturing did not. Trump’s tax cuts helped boost manufacturing in 2018 (blue-collar job growth hit the fastest pace since the early 1980s), but the president’s tariffs have since taken a toll, sending manufacturing into a “technical recession” in 2019.

8. Home prices. The housing market was at the heart of the 2007-2008 financial crisis, and many Americans lost their homes or watched the value of their homes plummet. Home prices bounced back at the end of Obama’s term and have continued a steady climb under Trump.

9. Gas prices. Americans keep a close eye on gas prices and tend to get nervous when it climbs above $3 a gallon nationally, but for much of Obama’s second term and Trump’s first term, gas prices have remained under that key threshold.

10. Federal debt. The national debt swelled under Obama as the federal government spent money trying to rebuild the economy after the Great Recession. At the end of Obama’s term, the annual deficit had declined considerably, but it has since jumped up again under Trump because of his tax cut and increased government spending.

11. Wages. For much of Obama’s time in office, wages remained subdued, and his economic team cited lackluster wager gains as the “unfinished business” of his presidency. Under Trump, average hourly pay has climbed and is now growing more than 3 percent a year for the first time in more than a decade. There’s debate about how much credit Trump deserves for this, but his tax cuts and the jump in business optimism probably played a role. Concern is rising, however, that wage growth is stalling in 2019.

12. Consumer confidence. Confidence in the economy has jumped since Trump’s election. This is an area where there has been a clear break from Obama, although experts debate how much of a difference it has made. Normally when confidence rises, businesses and consumers spend more, but that hasn’t been the case, especially for businesses. Still, high confidence is probably playing a role in keeping the United States out of a recession, even as other parts of the world falter.

13. Trade deficit. The United States has purchased more from overseas than it has sold abroad for years, a situation known as a trade deficit. The trade deficit declined during the Great Recession but has since expanded, which is typically a sign that the U.S. economy is growing robustly. Trump campaigned on bringing the trade deficit down, but it has grown during his tenure.

14. Uninsured Americans. One of Obama’s key policy goals was to get more Americans health insurance. The number of people without health insurance fell noticeably during his tenure after the passage of the Affordable Care Act. Progress has since stalled under Trump, who attempted (unsuccessfully) to repeal Obamacare.","(0, 'GDP')"

Some of its effects are already visible, and some of them will take months, or even years, to understand. After all, economists are still publishing studies about the effect of the last comprehensive tax overhaul back in 1986, signed by Ronald Reagan.

Here’s what we can — and can’t — say about how President Donald Trump’s tax cuts have impacted the economy so far.

1. Corporate taxes fell off a cliff, fueling deeper deficits

One of the central features of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was a drop in the corporate income tax rate, from 35% to 21%.

Even though plenty of companies never paid that full rate because of various exemptions, the decrease still took a big bite out of corporate tax collections. They plunged from a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of $264 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $149 billion the next, when the new rules went into effect, and they haven’t bounced back.

We were the highest taxed place on earth. Now we are not.” Kevin Hassett, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers

Corporate income taxes make up only a small slice of the federal government’s overall tax revenue, and have declined as a share of the economy from their post-World War II height in 1951. However, corporate tax revenue still tends to increase when the economy is doing well. This is the first time corporate taxes have taken such a hit when the economy is not in recession.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office forecasts that corporate income tax revenues will gradually rise in the coming years, as will personal income taxes — but not enough for the tax cuts to “pay for themselves,” as their Republican backers claimed they would. According to the CBO, the tax overhaul is set to add $1.85 trillion to the national debt over an 11-year period, even accounting for positive macroeconomic effects.

Congress has yet to take up spending cuts to big-ticket items like Medicare and Social Security that the White House had proposed to curb deficits. Still, mounting debt makes conversations around future expenditures more difficult. Lawmakers have choked on passing a large infrastructure package, for example, because there’s no plan to pay for it.

“In some ways, our economy is held back by the public investments that we are not making,” said Steve Wamhoff, director of federal tax policy for the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. “Even if we think that spending on infrastructure would be a good thing, politically we can’t do this spending because we have to address this deficit.”

2. A short-term economic boost is fading

Most economists forecast that the tax cuts, along with a boost to military spending, would goose the economy initially. The CBO estimates that about 0.3 percentage points of the 2.9% growth in gross domestic product in 2018 can be attributed to the tax cuts.

Part of that came from an increase in business investment in research and development, new factories and equipment, possibly encouraged by a provision that allowed businesses to immediately expense capital expenditures, rather than expense them gradually over several years. Business investment grew 8.4% from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter or 2018. That’s a good sign because better factories, equipment and tools are supposed to boost productivity, which in some cases allows workers to make more money.

Wages did start to grow a bit faster at the end of 2018, at least by some measures, especially for workers on the lower end of the income spectrum. But that was also a consequence of a tight labor market created by nearly a decade of continuous job growth, as well as minimum wage hikes in many states.

The White House’s Council of Economic Advisers used the growth surge in 2018 to trumpet the tax cuts as a success. The new lower corporate rate and temporary tax holiday on the repatriation of cash earned overseas, they argue, created a surge of investable capital — though companies returned a large chunk of it to investors in the form of share repurchases, mergers and acquisitions.

At the same time, they say the effects will take years to play out.

“We were the highest taxed place on earth. Now we are not,” said CEA Chair Kevin Hassett on CNN last week. “The adjustment to having all the industry come home is not something that happens overnight, it spreads out over three to five years.”

At the moment, though, trends are moving in the wrong direction. Business’ plans for capital expenditures have been declining for about a year now, according to an index maintained by Morgan Stanley. And aside from those who work for the White House, most economists — including those who work at the Federal Reserve and the International Monetary Fund — expect US economic growth to decline to about 2.1% to 2.3% in 2019.

Why? One possibility is that the boost in business investment may have had more to do with a rise in oil prices, which now drives a significant amount of domestic activity because of the US’ vast shale reserves, according to an analyst at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business.

The hurdle to investment in recent years has more to do with weak demand for goods rather than a shortage of capital, according to Kyle Pomerleau, chief economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation.

“If you look at the US economy, it’s not lack of cash that’s keeping companies from investing,” Pomerleau said. “The whole issue is whether that cash can be deployed in a productive manner. Are there investments out there that result in a high enough after-tax return to be worthwhile?”

As evidence that there aren’t, most multinational companies haven’t fundamentally changed the complex tax structures that allow them to book profits overseas, according to an analysis by Council on Foreign Relations senior fellow Brad Setser.

You have two tax policies working against one another.” Kyle Pomerleau, Chief Economist at the Tax Foundation

Meanwhile, the White House has engaged in a trade war that makes raw materials like lumber and steel more expensive in the US, raising the cost of domestic production.

“You have two tax policies working against one another,” Pomerleau says.

3. Rich people gained more than poor people

About 66% of taxpayers saw their federal tax bill decline by more than $100 in 2018, the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation reported in March. And according to the tax preparation giant H&R Block, total liabilities are down by nearly 25%. But the magnitude of those reductions varies a lot according to how much money you make, and has had the overall effect of widening income inequality in America.

Here’s one way of looking at it: As a result of both the business and personal income tax cuts, households making between $500,000 and $1 million will see their after-tax income rise by an average of 5.2%. Households making less than $50,000 (the median income is $61,372 in the US) see only a 0.6% increase.

In part, that’s because of a provision that allows taxpayers that earn money through “pass-through” businesses to take a deduction equal to 20% of that income. Pass-through businesses include everything from architecture firms to part-time landlords incorporated as partnerships and limited liability companies.

“The people who are benefiting the most, and the people who are benefiting the most through pass-throughs, are really rich people,” said Jason Oh, a tax law professor at the University of California-Los Angeles.

Lower-income people, meanwhile, pay very little in taxes already and thus didn’t benefit as much. They may even be hurt by the pass-through deduction. According to Nancy Abramowitz, head of the federal tax legal clinic at American University, employers have used it as a reason to encourage low-wage workers to become independent contractors, which also comes with the loss of many rights and benefits.

The tax act’s unequal distribution of benefits is now prompting calls for further changes to even the scales.

Capitalizing on polling showing that most people believe the tax system is unfairly skewed towards the wealthy, 46 Senate Democrats have backed a bill that would effectively boost subsidies for children and earned income. It attracted no Republican co-sponsors and had no price tag attached. But several announced Presidential candidates have similar plans, so if the Senate and the White House flip in 2020, it stands a good chance of becoming law.

4. Most other impacts: Either too soon to tell or too hard to see

The 2017 tax overhaul either pleased or dismayed a host of special interests, but it’s still difficult to know whether their respective hopes or fears came true.

Take the mortgage interest deduction, which was capped at $750,000 in total amount borrowed and also weakened by the doubling of the standard deduction. Realtors worried that would put people off from buying homes — especially the most expensive ones.

So far, signals are mixed. New home sales increased in 2018 over the previous year, according to the National Association of Home Builders, even though construction permits leveled off. Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that some of that was likely due to several provisions in the tax overhaul, including the limitation on the mortgage interest deduction.

The homeownership rate, however, has continued to rebound from a low in 2016. And the housing market is subject to so many other factors — from mortgage interest rates to the price of concrete — that it’s hard to isolate the impact of a tweaked tax provision.

The same is true of the capped state and local tax deduction, which disproportionately hurt states with high tax burdens like New Jersey and California. So far, according to a report by Moody’s Investor Service, there hasn’t been any noticeable uptick in migration out of those states; many people move from one high-tax state to another.

“Job opportunities and demographic trends influence migration more than tax rates,” the report said.

Finally, nonprofits had fretted that since fewer people would be taking the charitable deduction, their contributions might sag. The Penn-Wharton Budget Model predicted the tax law would decrease charitable giving by $22 billion in 2018. Instead, an annual report from the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy at Indiana University projected above-trend growth in giving for 2019 and 2020, fueled by a healthy stock market and rising incomes.

However, the effect will be uneven. Lower-income filers will no longer benefit from the charitable deduction, which means the causes they favor may lose out.

“Larger institutions that depend on higher-income households may not feel the impact,” said Una Osili, who authored the Indiana University report. “But if you think about the causes that everyday givers support, like community based organizations, they see more of an impact.”

The impact that’s unseen

Most of the true impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is still yet to be felt. But one implication is already operating in the background. Tax cuts can help ease the impact of economic downturns, and now, there’s a lot less room to use them.

“The thing that’s related that I’m more concerned about is, we will eventually face another recession,” says Oh, of UCLA. “And what we’ve done through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is use a bunch of the tools that we need to deal with the next recession, at a time when we don’t have a recession.”","(4, 'national debt')"

Here are 5 takeaways from that report

President Donald Trump said he doesn't ""believe"" a major report that includes the economic impact of climate change on the U.S. made public by his administration on Friday – a holiday week release.

Trump on Monday said that he's read some of the report and that ""it's fine,"" but he doesn't believe some of the analysis that predicts possible devastating effects on the economy.

Here are five things to know about the National Climate Assessment released last week.

What is the report?

The report released Friday is part of a series of reports published by the U.S. Global Change Research Program to analyze research on the impacts of climate change on the U.S., which Congress established in 1990. The research program consults with hundreds of subject matter experts from 13 federal agencies, state and local governments, and academic researchers. The experts look at the available research and models to write the comprehensive report and evaluate how confident they are in the findings.

The first volume of the report, the Climate Science Special Report released last year, was designed as an ""authoritative assessment of the science of climate change"" to inform policymakers and the public as they decide how to respond to climate change, according to the executive summary. The National Climate Assessment released last week looks more specifically at the impact of climate change in different parts of the U.S. and how local leaders are working to respond to those impacts.

The report concludes that ""the evidence of human-caused climate change is overwhelming and continues to strengthen, that the impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country, and that climate-related threats to Americans’ physical, social, and economic well-being are rising.""

1:09

It also found that while Americans in some areas are working to limit the negative consequences of climate change none of the work being done ""currently approach the scales needed to avoid substantial damages to the U.S. economy, environment, and human health and well-being over the coming decades.""

The White House said in a statement the report is ""largely based on the most extreme scenario"" and doesn't account for reduced greenhouse gas emissions and new technologies that reduce pollution. Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters also said in a statement the White House wants more transparency in these reports.

The report went through an extensive process since 2016, including being posted for 60 days of public comment in January of this year and multiple rounds of review to incorporate comments from government agencies and other experts.

The version released publicly last week aims to make the information accessible to a broad audience but cites more than 6,000 unique references and consulted 300 different authors, according to the release.

Concerns the administration tried to bury it

Climate experts, researchers that worked on the report, activists, and Democratic lawmakers have raised concern that the Trump administration tried to bury the report by releasing it the day after Thanksgiving.

While the report still received widespread news coverage, critics say the timing combined with Trump's track record on casting doubt on climate science and the administration's push to reverse policies intended to combat climate change show the administration does not want to address the issue.

One of the editors of the report, World Resources Institute senior fellow Andrew Light, said the administration did not edit the findings of the report but they did decide when it would be released and the decision to publish it on Black Friday was irresponsible given the urgency of the subject matter.

""At the end of the day, this was simply not a responsible choice,"" Light told ABC News' Brad Mielke on the Start Here podcast.

In response to a recently released climate report from the United Nations, Trump said he does not think climate change is a ""hoax"" but he also cast doubt on some of the projections and even alluded that climate scientists are politically motivated.

Report found possibility for economic loss

The new National Climate Assessment builds on some findings from previous reports, such as the threat of flooding from sea level rise and more premature deaths attributed to extreme heat.

But the report also incorporated more information on the economic impacts of climate change and found that disruptive extreme weather events, rising temperatures, and the impacts of climate change in other countries could all damage the U.S. economy. For example, hotter temperatures could make power plants less efficient while demand for electricity goes up, resulting in higher costs for electricity.

Without more focus on adapting to climate change, the report found that as temperatures continue to rise it could lead to hundreds of billions of dollars in losses every year in damage to coastal properties, costs associated with heat-related deaths, and lost labor hours from extreme temperatures.

Climate impacts already being felt, but not equally

The impacts of climate change are already being felt in many communities, but they don't look the same in every community.

Climate change poses more risks to communities that are already vulnerable because they don't have the resources to prepare or adapt to harm from extreme weather, changes in temperature, or other disruptions to infrastructure and the economy.

But some parts of the country are more at risk than others.

In Alaska, for example, more infrastructure is being damaged when the layer of frozen ground called the permafrost thaws. Factors that kill trees and plants like longer droughts and higher temperatures are exacerbating wildfires in Alaska and other western states like California, where wildfires are especially costly.

Along the coasts, the report says climate change poses more of an economic risk since $1 trillion in national wealth is in coastal real estate. Rising sea levels, higher storm surges, and increases in flooding during high tide will threaten those properties and lead to more costs to preserve infrastructure on the coast, as well as potentially displace families that live there.

The report also references the possible impact of climate change on tourism from reduced snowpack, which affects areas in the western part of the country and the Northeast where tourist activities rely on natural snow and ice. In the Northeast especially the report says those activities ""may not be economically viable"" by the end of the century unless greenhouse gas emissions are significantly reduced. Outdoor recreation could also be impacted in areas where smoke from worsening wildfires cause poor air quality.

Will the report change anything?

The report intentionally does not recommend specific policies, but notes many observations for lawmakers to consider and highlights some examples of policies intended to limit the problems caused by climate change.

Most significantly the report says that even though natural gas and renewable energy have replaced fossil fuels in many areas, ""more immediate and substantial"" reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are needed to avoid the most severe, long-term consequences.

The Trump administration and Republican leadership in Congress have not signaled plans to take broad action on climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But high-ranking Democrats on committees that deal with federal environmental policy have said they plan intensive oversight of the Trump administration's decisions to roll back policies intended to combat climate change when the new legislative session starts in January.

Democrats will likely call for administration officials to defend the president's call to reduce regulations, roll back policies proposed by the Obama administration to aggressively combat climate change, and allow more energy production on federal land.

Congress is also expected to take up a spending bill that would allocate billions of dollars for infrastructure projects. The report says that aging infrastructure around the country is stressed extreme weather events and overall is not prepared for a changing climate.

National and local lawmakers could consider the findings of the report when deciding how much to spend on projects like repairing roads and bridges or updating water systems.","(4, 'national debt')"
343,AP fact check: Trump overstates his claims on the economy - PBS NewsHour,AP fact check: Trump overstates his claims on the economy  PBS NewsHour,"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBicy5vcmcvbmV3c2hvdXIvcG9saXRpY3MvYXAtZmFjdC1jaGVjay10cnVtcC1vdmVyc3RhdGVzLWhpcy1jbGFpbXMtb24tdGhlLWVjb25vbXnSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYnMub3JnL25ld3Nob3VyL2FtcC9wb2xpdGljcy9hcC1mYWN0LWNoZWNrLXRydW1wLW92ZXJzdGF0ZXMtaGlzLWNsYWltcy1vbi10aGUtZWNvbm9teQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,PBS NewsHour,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is prematurely claiming he proved naysayers wrong in boosting U.S. economic growth.

Speaking at events Thursday in Iowa and Illinois, Trump claimed victory in advance of Friday’s government release of quarterly gross domestic product data, saying “nobody thought we were going to be this great” and that when he became president, “those numbers were bad.”

In fact, the skepticism from economists has centered more on whether strong GDP growth would be sustainable after a few quarters. That question has yet to be answered; it’s not unusual for the economy to surge forward temporarily.

Trump also falsely repeated a claim that the U.S. economy is the best “we’ve ever had” and incorrectly asserted that Canada’s trade market is “totally closed.”

A look at the claims:

TRUMP: “We’re having the best economy we’ve ever had in the history of our country.” — remarks in Granite City, Illinois.

THE FACTS: Even allowing for some Trumpian exaggeration, this overstates things.

The unemployment rate is near a 40-year low and growth is solid, but by many measures the current economy trails other periods in U.S. history. Average hourly pay, before adjusting for inflation, is rising at about a 2.5 percent annual rate, below the 4 percent level reached in the late 1990s when the unemployment rate was as low as it is now.

Pay was growing even faster in the late 1960s, when the jobless rate remained below 4 percent for nearly four years. And economic growth topped 4 percent for three full years from 1998 through 2000, an annual rate it hasn’t touched since.

TRUMP, on GDP figures: “On Friday, numbers come out and I don’t know what they are, but there are predictions from 3.8 to 5.3. … Nobody thought we were going to be this great. … When I took over those numbers were bad, and they were heading in the wrong direction, because of regulation. Really the taxes were too high … jobs were, forget it.” — remarks at workforce event in Peosta, Iowa.

THE FACTS: Economists do expect a strong number for growth in the April-June quarter, but it is likely to be a temporary bounce. And the U.S. economy wasn’t doing nearly as bad before Trump took office as he suggests.

Few economists doubted that growth could accelerate after the Trump administration’s tax cuts were passed last year, and Congress approved a big increase in government spending earlier this year.

But the skepticism Trump describes centers on whether the second quarter’s outsize growth can be sustained. The economy faces two significant structural drags: an aging population, which means fewer people are working and more are retired, and weak productivity growth, which means that those who are working aren’t increasing their output as quickly as in the past.



President Donald Trump discussed trade in Granite City, Illnois, on Thursday. Watch his remarks in the player above.

Trump’s tax cuts can stimulate faster growth by putting more money in people’s pockets, but most economists expect the effect will be temporary, as those two trends act like gravity and pull the economy’s longer-term growth lower.

When the Commerce Department releases the growth figures for the April-June quarter Friday morning, economists forecast they will show the economy expanded at a 4.1 percent annual rate, according to data provider FactSet. Some analysts have said the figure could reach as high as 5 percent.

Americans have ramped up their spending after cutting back in the first three months of the year, encouraged by tax cuts that have left more money in their pockets. Yet the tax cuts provide a one-time lift to take-home pay and will likely have less impact next year, analysts say.

A large, temporary surge in agricultural exports, specifically soybeans, should also juice growth in the second quarter. Exports of U.S. soybeans soared as companies sought to ship them to China before that country slapped tariffs on them in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, forecast that soybean exports alone likely boosted GDP by 0.5 percentage point in the second quarter.

Many economists forecast growth will drop back to roughly 2.5 percent to 3 percent in the third quarter.

For the year, the economy is likely to expand at a 3 percent pace or more for the first time since 2005. But most economists forecast it will fall back below 3 percent soon afterward.

It’s not unusual for the economy to surge forward temporarily. Growth reached 5.2 percent in the third quarter of 2014, before falling back to 2 percent in the next quarter.

Growth also wasn’t as bad when he took office as Trump claims. The economy expanded 2.9 percent in 2015, though it slowed the following year. Businesses added 2.3 million jobs in 2016, before Trump took office, more than the 2.2 million gained in 2017.

TRUMP: “The Canadians you have a totally closed market … they have a 375 percent tax on dairy products, other than that it’s wonderful to deal. And we have a very big deficit with Canada, a trade deficit.” — remarks in Peosta, Iowa.

THE FACTS: No, it’s not totally closed. Because of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Canada’s market is almost totally open to the United States. Each country has a few products that are still largely protected, such as dairy in Canada and sugar in the United States.

Trump also repeated his claim that the U.S. has a trade deficit with Canada, but that is true only in goods. When services are included, such as insurance, tourism, and engineering, the U.S. had a $2.8 billion surplus with Canada last year.

Associated Press writers Jill Colvin in Peosta, Iowa, and Granite City, Ill., and Hope Yen, Darlene Superville and Ken Thomas in Washington contributed to this report.

Trump said he was ordering the EPA to reopen a mid-term review of Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards that would require the industry to deliver a fleet average of at least 54.5 mpg by 2025. Many — though not all — manufacturers have warned they cannot meet that target without raising vehicle prices beyond what consumers could afford, something Ford CEO Mark Fields in January told the president could cost 1 million automotive jobs.

The announcement that the government would review both the mileage target and timing was actually less of a radical development than many had expected, with some industry observers questioning whether the new administration might slash the numbers immediately or, perhaps, repeal CAFE entirely as part of Trump’s promise to reduce government regulations.

Controversial EPA Head

Such moves might yet happen, environmentalists fear, especially with the recent confirmation of Scott Pruitt, a long-time agency critic, as head of the EPA. Another prospect is that the administration may revoke the waiver that allows California to set its own emissions standards. The state has used that rule to demand automakers start rolling out large numbers of zero-emissions vehicles, such as the hydrogen-powered models from Honda, Toyota and Hyundai, as well as battery cars like the Tesla Model S and Chevrolet Bolt EV. A dozen states have now copied the California mandate.

CAFE dates back to the 1970s, when Congress decided to force the industry to reduce dependence upon foreign oil in the wake of the first Mideast oil embargo. The 2025 target was set as part of a compromise reached between the Obama Administration and the auto industry. But in recent years, as oil prices have plunged, and Americans have shifted from small, fuel-efficient sedans to big SUVs and pickups, that has complicated the effort of meeting the 54.5 mpg target.

The mandate called for a mid-term review to see if the goal remained feasible. Despite strong industry demands for relief, the EPA sided with environmentalists, issuing what Trump decried as an “11th hour” ruling ordering the mileage mandate to stand just days before Obama left office.

The new president positioned his decision along the lines outlined by Ford CEO Fields, arguing that, “This is going to be a new era for American jobs and job creation,” during a media roundtable. The visit to Michigan was held at the site of the old B24 bomber plant from World War II in the Detroit suburb of Ypsilanti. It is now being converted to a test track for the development of autonomous vehicles.

“My administration will work tirelessly to eliminate the industry-killing regulations,” Trump said, his new EPA chief Pruitt adding his assertion that “these standards are costly for automakers and the American people.”

Not surprisingly, automakers praised the Wednesday announcement, though the president’s action also was roundly condemned by those who said it would condemn Americans to deal with dirtier air, a warming global climate and be a boondoggle for energy companies.

Pollution Concerns

California Governor Jerry Brown called the move “an unconscionable gift for polluters,” adding that his state will launch a lawsuit, along with New York, challenging the re-opening of the review.

“If they succeed, we’ll pay more at the pump, depend more on oil from bad countries, drive up the trade deficit and pollute our kids,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign.

Ordering the mid-term review reopened, a final decision might not be made until as late as April of 2018. That raises the question of how the auto industry will respond. Key planning moves, particular when it comes to investments on advanced powertrains and other key, energy saving technologies, must be made years in advance, and several industry officials said they’ve already begun laying out strategies, and making preliminary investments, reaching out to 2025.

Related: EPA Finalizes 54.5 mpg Standard

They may be reluctant to now hold back on the assumption of a CAFE rollback by the Trump Administration, especially if that were to face a credible legal challenge.

At the worst for environmentalists, automakers might decide to cut some of their zero-emission and alternative energy programs. At a more benign level, observers suggested, the industry might simply use a cut in the 54.5 mpg target to increase their mix of less efficient light trucks.

Renewed Efforts on Electric

In recent months, General Motors CEO Mary Barra has said the automaker “remains committed” to adding more plug-in hybrids and battery-electric vehicles, such as the Chevrolet Volt and the Chevy Bolt EV.

Foreign-based makers seem even more determined to stay the course with high-efficiency gasoline and alternative-power vehicles.

“No matter what happens in the U.S., we will not change any of our plans for electrified vehicles and more efficient vehicles,” Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn declared during a news conference at the Geneva Motor Show last week.

That stand was echoed by Steve Center, the vice president of the Environmental Business Office at American Honda. “It doesn’t change anything. We, as an organization, have beliefs, and we are going to tear up our plans.”

Honda is just launching its new Clarity FCV, a hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle, and its global CEO recently reaffirmed plans to have fully half of the company’s products powered either by batteries or hydrogen by 2025.

Center said Honda isn’t entirely pleased with strict mandates, like CAFE, in part because “No government can regulate what people buy.” And so, as the current surge of demand for pickups and SUVs demonstrates, it can become more difficult to meet mandates while also giving consumers the products they want.

While automakers like Nissan, Honda and Toyota are expected to continue introducing more green vehicles, industry analysts say they may still wind up lowering their own corporate mileage targets by increasing production of their own light truck models — such as the Nissan Murano SUV, the new midsize Honda Ridgeline pickup and the full-size Toyota Tundra pickup.

Global Standards

One reason why all makers, Detroit, European or Asian, may find it difficult to make major shifts in their strategies is the fact that they all operate on a global scale. With a few exceptions, notably their big pickups, automakers design their vehicles to be sold around the world.

And so, said Nissan’s Ghosn, even if the U.S. rolls back CAFE, the likelihood is for even tougher emissions standards in other key markets, such as Europe, Japan and China. “We’re going to have to keep an eye” on those rules, and develop vehicles accordingly, he said, no matter what happens in the U.S.","(4, 'national debt')"

The strategy directs the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) to locate domestic supplies of those minerals, ensure access to information necessary for the study and production of minerals, and expedite permitting for minerals projects.

“Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, today’s federal strategy lays out a blueprint for America to once again be a leader in the critical minerals sector,” said Secretary David Bernhardt. “As with our energy security, the Trump Administration is dedicated to ensuring that we are never held hostage to foreign powers for the natural resources critical to our national security and economic growth. The Department will work expeditiously to implement the President's strategy from streamlining the permitting process to locating domestic supplies of minerals.”

Currently, the U.S. relies on other countries completely for more than a dozen of minerals that are vital to our economy and security. These minerals are used for things like cell phones, computers, automobiles, airplanes, ships, and many other products that are critical to our economy and security.

In 2017, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 13817, A Federal Strategy to Ensure Secure and Reliable Supplies of Critical Minerals. This Executive Order called on agencies across the federal government to develop a strategy to reduce the Nation’s susceptibility to critical mineral supply disruptions.

In May of 2018, DOI took the first step in the strategy, releasing a list of 35 minerals deemed critical to the U.S. economy and security, based on a methodology by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). This list forms the foundation of the full strategy, which entails a number of other actions that the Department will take.

Faster Permitting

Mining remains the most important method for acquiring critical minerals, and Federal lands provide significant opportunities for mining. Prolonged Federal permitting and land management policies have inhibited access to and the development of domestic critical minerals, which has contributed to an increased reliance on foreign sources of minerals.

To reduce unnecessary permitting delays and increase access to critical minerals, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which is responsible for onshore mineral rights and mining on lands managed by BLM, will undertake a comprehensive review of its permitting and land classifications, as well as its management plans. The BLM administers more than 245 million surface acres of public land and 700 million acres of subsurface mineral estate and is committed to implementing efficiencies for the environmentally responsible development of critical minerals on Federal lands. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) will undertake a similar review for mineral permitting in the Federal Offshore and Exclusive Economic Zone.

Finding New Sources of Domestic Minerals

The U.S. is blessed with an abundance of mineral resources, but many of the easy-to-find deposits have been discovered. New deposits, both onshore and offshore, are increasingly located deeper underground and are more difficult to find. To find these new deposits of critical minerals, the USGS has embarked on a new nationwide program of surface and subsurface mapping – the Earth Mapping Resources Initiative – to better inform the country about its critical minerals potential. The BOEM has initiated a complementary effort to better evaluate the nation’s offshore mineral potential.

Mining is not the only way to secure critical minerals. Alternatives, such as recycling, processing mine waste, extraction from seawater, or even filtering them from energy byproducts, could prove valuable sources for critical minerals. USGS will assist other Federal agencies, including the Department of Energy, Department of Commerce, Department of Agriculture and DOI bureaus like the BLM and BOEM, with evaluating these unconventional methods for bolstering the traditional supplies of critical minerals.

Better Information

Managing the supply of critical minerals depends on using the best information. Data on mining, processing, and transporting critical minerals are essential to strengthening domestic supply chains, and the USGS will continue to supply that data through a variety of authoritative scientific publications. Those data inform biennial re-evaluations of which minerals are critical to the United States.

In addition, the USGS will conduct at least one multi-commodity critical mineral resource assessment every two years, supplying the results to Federal land managers and the public. Meanwhile, BOEM will work with partners such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to develop a method for assessing critical mineral potential in the Federal Offshore and Exclusive Economic Zone.

DOI is entrusted with the conservation and management of the Nation’s natural resources and cultural heritage for the benefit and enjoyment of the American people and future generations, which includes more than 500 million acres of Federal lands and resources.

The president met with top auto executives Friday to discuss the standards and tasked Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and embattled Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt to handle the talks with California officials, according to two people briefed on the meeting. The people spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private discussions.

The auto industry wants to relax the federal fuel economy standards, but not so much that they provoke a legal fight with California, which has power to impose its own stricter tailpipe pollution limits. Such a fight could create two different mileage standards in the U.S., forcing automakers to engineer and produce two versions of each of their vehicle models and driving up costs.

A Trump administration official said the two agencies have had meetings and discussions with California officials on the issue for several months.

Executives from auto companies met with Mr. Trump and cabinet officials on Friday. Embattled EPA chief Scott Pruitt was also there when the president responded to a question about whether he still has confidence in Pruitt.

Two auto industry trade groups confirmed in a statement that Mr. Trump was willing to talk with California, but they provided no specifics. The Alliance for Automotive Manufacturers and Global Automakers said they appreciated Trump's ""openness to a discussion with California on an expedited basis.""

During the meeting, one executive brought up how it would be better for the industry to have one standard instead of two, and Trump instructed Pruitt and Chao to go to California for talks, the people said.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president and the automakers discussed ""how best to move forward"" on the fuel economy standards.

The EPA under Mr. Trump has proposed freezing the standards at 2020 levels for the next five years, according to a draft of the proposal obtained by Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del. Under the proposal, the fleet of new vehicles would have to average roughly 30 miles per gallon in real-world driving, and that wouldn't change through at least 2025.

The EPA under Obama proposed standards that gradually would become tougher during that period, rising to 36 mpg in 2025, 10 mpg higher than the current requirement. California and automakers agreed to the rules in 2012, setting a single national fuel economy standard.

If California splits from the federal rule under consideration by the Trump administration, it likely would be joined by 12 states that follow its standards. Together they make up about 40 percent of U.S. new-vehicle sales.

Any big change by Mr. Trump certainly would bring lawsuits from environmental groups as well as California. Leaks about the Trump EPA plan already have provoked a suit from California and 16 other states.

In testimony to Congress this month, Mitch Bainwol, CEO of the manufacturers' alliance, said the trade group urged the administration to find a solution that increases mileage requirements from 2022 to 2025 and includes California to keep one national standard.

""The resulting regulatory nightmare would ultimately harm consumers by increasing vehicle costs and restricting consumer choice,"" Bainwol said.

Mr. Trump said during the meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House that he wanted to discuss the ""manufacturing of millions of more cars within the United States, for Michigan, for Ohio, for Pennsylvania"" and states like South Carolina and North Carolina.

As the auto executives introduced themselves, the president joked to Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Fiat Chrysler, that ""right now he's my favorite man in the room"" because he's moving a plant from Mexico to Michigan.

Mr. Trump won the presidency in 2016 in part on his strength in the industrial Midwest states of Michigan and Ohio, which employ thousands of people in auto and parts manufacturing. The meeting came as the administration has been holding extensive negotiations with Mexico and Canada on a rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the auto industry is watching warily.

Asked if the deal might adversely affect the industry, Trump said, ""NAFTA has been a terrible deal, we're renegotiating it now, we'll see what happens.""

""Mexico and Canada, look, they don't like to lose the golden goose. But I'm representing the United States. I'm not representing Mexico and I'm not representing Canada,"" he said. ""We'll see if we can make it reasonable.""

Automakers have been lobbying the Trump administration to revisit the fuel economy requirements, saying they'll have trouble reaching them because people are buying bigger vehicles due to low gas prices.

When the single national standard was adopted six years ago, cars, which get better mileage than trucks and SUVs, made up just under half of U.S. new vehicle sales. By the end of last year, however, trucks and SUVs were close to two-thirds of all sales.

Some environmental groups oppose any reduction in the standards, saying that the ones developed in 2012 allow for changes in consumer buying habits. Reducing the standards, they say, will increase pollution and raise gasoline prices at the pump.

Requirements now are lower for bigger vehicles such as trucks and SUVs, said Luke Tonachel, director of clean vehicles for the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""The standards automatically adjust to the sales mix of vehicles,"" he said.

Environmental groups also say the industry marketed trucks and SUVs to the public because they make bring higher profits than cars.

Auto executives attending the meeting included Marchionne, General Motors CEO Mary Barra, Ford CEO Jim Hackett and Bob Carter, executive vice president of North America for Toyota.

Could that affect the economy? | Reuters/Leah Millis

Could Donald Trump’s chaotic management style scare the economy into a downturn?

Probably not. But if the economy does hit a rough patch, warns Nicholas Bloom at Stanford Graduate School of Business, the president’s volatility is likely to make things worse.

Bloom, a professor of economics, has been studying the economic impact of “uncertainty shocks” for years. He is also a co-creator, with Steven J. Davis at the University of Chicago and Scott Baker at Northwestern University, of the much-followed Economic Policy Uncertainty Index.

One of Bloom’s key conclusions is that uncertainty shocks, including uncertainty about economic policy, amplify the impact of a downturn.

And President Trump, says Bloom, has clearly elevated the level of uncertainty.

“Whether you love or loathe Trump’s policies, it is clear that he is unpredictable,” he says. “He changes his mind often and changes his advisors even faster. That makes him the most unpredictable president in recent times.”

If the economy hits a pothole, for whatever reason, Trump’s unpredictability is likely to paralyze investors and corporations even more than usual. But even if the economy doesn’t tank, Bloom says, the unpredictability will take a toll.

“He’s increased the level of uncertainty,” he says. “That’s going to edge down long-term growth, and it’s very easy to understand why. If you’re a firm making long-run investments in R&D projects or in hiring and training, those investments become less attractive as uncertainty goes up.”

In a new paper, Bloom and four colleagues estimate that a severe uncertainty shock can reduce Gross Domestic Product by as much as 2.5% — a very big hit, given that U.S. economic growth barely averages 3% a year.

The initial shock to an economy can be sparked by something basic, like a housing slump or drop in consumer demand. But uncertainty amplifies the original blow, because businesses hold back on investing and hiring, which depresses economic activity even more. Uncertainty also undermines productivity growth, which is the bedrock of economic growth, because it slows the reallocation of capital to more productive uses. Strong companies stop expanding, but weak ones stop contracting too — everybody becomes paralyzed, like deer caught in headlights.

Strong but Skittish Market

To be sure, U.S. economic growth has been strong and the stock market has surged since Trump’s election. But Trump has repeatedly jolted investors, especially with his bellicose push for tariffs on imports against trade partners from China and Canada to the European Union.

The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, which scores uncertainty by tabulating news coverage, indicates that uncertainty about trade policy has shot up five-fold since 2015 and has become a major driver of rising policy uncertainty.

Trump’s tariffs, and his threats of bigger ones to come, have repeatedly roiled the stock markets. On seven days in the first half of 2018, according to an analysis by Steve Liesman of CNBC, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by an average of 1.7% in response to announcements by Trump of new tariffs. Those drops added up to a combined drop of $700 billion in market value. And though stock prices generally bounced back, the uncertainty remains high.

Unfortunately, Bloom predicts, policy uncertainty is likely to keep climbing in the United States and in many other nations.

“In the last five years, politics have been the main driver of uncertainty, and it’s been driven by the rise of backlash against populist leaders,” he says. “I think this all stems from rising inequality — people are angry and vote for more radical politicians. If inequality does not subdue, I do not see this changing. If you have 50% of the population seeing no gains from free market capitalism, they will naturally vote for anti-establishment politicians.”","(0, 'GDP')"

The attention on Obama comes as the ex-president steps back into the political arena on behalf of Democrats in the November elections. The White House dispatched economic adviser Kevin Hassett to rebut Obama’s point that his policies helped end the Great Recession and put the economy on a growth path that Trump is now mostly benefiting from.

The chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers Kevin Hassett addressed the nation’s economy in Tuesday’s briefing. Video by PBS NewsHour.

Companies are much more optimistic and have increased spending on buildings and equipment, Hassett said. Americans are starting new businesses and the increase in startups is accelerating more quickly than it did under Obama, he added, and blue-collar jobs — in mining, construction and manufacturing — are growing more rapidly.

Yet some of the White House’s case is wrong, exaggerated or lacks context:

GDP AND UNEMPLOYMENT

TRUMP: “The GDP rate (4.2 percent) is higher than the Unemployment Rate (3.9 percent) for the first time in over 100 years!” — tweet Monday.

The GDP Rate (4.2%) is higher than the Unemployment Rate (3.9%) for the first time in over 100 years! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 10, 2018

HASSETT: “The correct number is 10 years.”

THE FACTS: Actually, the correct number is 12 years. In the first three months of 2006, the economy expanded at a 5.4 percent annual rate. At the same time, the unemployment rate was 4.7 percent.

The economy’s growth rate, which reached 4.2 percent in the April-June quarter, has been higher than the unemployment rate dozens of times since World War II. Hassett acknowledged Trump’s tweet was wrong.

ECONOMIC UPTICK

HASSETT: “There was an inflection at the election of Donald Trump, and … a whole bunch of data items started heading north.”

THE FACTS: If you look at a chart of monthly job gains or the economy’s growth rate, that inflection point is hard to spot. Hassett notably did not include in his presentation any mention of overall job creation or the broadest measurement of the economy’s output, GDP.

That’s probably because the growth rate Trump repeatedly cites, the 4.2 percent expansion at an annual rate that occurred in the April-June quarter, isn’t out of line with Obama’s record. The economy grew more quickly than that four times during Obama’s eight years in office.

Economists generally acknowledge that growth has accelerated this year compared with 2016 and 2017, and most of them partly credit last year’s tax cuts for fueling more consumer and business spending. The economy is on pace to grow at a 3 percent or faster pace in 2018, which would be the first time since 2005 it would reach that mark.

Yet it barely missed that cutoff in 2015, when it expanded 2.9 percent under Obama.

When it comes to jobs, the U.S. added more jobs in each of the last three years of Obama’s presidency, 2014-2016, than it did last year, Trump’s first in office. Job growth has picked up a bit this year but is still on track to come in below the 2014-2015 pace.

SMALL BUSINESS OPTIMISM

HASSETT: “Small-business optimism is near the highest level in 35 years.”

THE FACTS: This is true. Small-business owners, as a whole, became far more optimistic about the economy after Trump’s election.

Many small-business people felt Obama was dismissive toward their efforts, particularly after his “You didn’t build that” comment in July 2012. Obama’s larger point was that governments helped create success by building roads, bridges, and the foundations for the internet. But his opponent at that time, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, seized on the comment as evidence that Obama didn’t appreciate small business.

Still, optimism doesn’t automatically translate into more spending or jobs. Small-business hiring has slowed in the past year as the unemployment rate has fallen to nearly an 18-year low. Larger firms are better able to attract workers in a tight labor market because they typically can offer higher pay and more benefits.

CAPITAL INVESTMENTS

HASSETT: “And I think that if anyone were to assert that the capital spending boom that we’re seeing right now was a continuation of the trend that President Trump inherited, then, well, they wouldn’t get a high grade in graduate school for that assertion.”

THE FACTS: It’s true that companies are investing much more in buildings, computers and other capital goods than they were in the last two years of the Obama administration. And some of that additional investment may have been spurred by the Trump administration’s corporate tax cut.

But another reason for the revitalization of business spending has been a turnaround in oil prices. Oil prices plunged in 2014 and 2015 from over $100 a barrel to roughly $30 a barrel in early 2016.

Johnson, America’s first black billionaire, said during a CNBC appearance on Friday that black Americans should be encouraged by the growing economy under President Trump. “Something is going right,” said Johnson, owner and chairman of Bethesda-based asset management firm RLJ Companies.

He cited the December jobs report showing that unemployment among black workers was at its lowest since the Labor Department began tracking the data in 1972.

Black unemployment did fall to 6.8 percent in December, before rising and dipping again to 6.9 percent in March, according to the latest jobs numbers released Friday. But black unemployment remains nearly double the white unemployment rate of 3.6 percent, even though the gap has narrowed somewhat.

Johnson, during his appearance on “Squawk Box” on Friday morning before the March jobs report was released, was optimistic about how black Americans will continue to fare economically.

""You have to take encouragement from what's happening in the labor force and the job market,"" Johnson said. ""When you look at African American unemployment, in over 50 years since the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping the numbers, you've never had two things: African American unemployment this low and the spread between unemployment among whites and African Americans narrowing.

“That absolutely means the jobs market is soliciting employees who have been out of the labor force, some of it just based on discrimination, some of it based on changes in education, access and technology changes,” he continued. “And so when you look at that, you have to say something is going right.”

Johnson praised the current U.S. business environment, “if you take into account the Trump tax cut,” he said. “I believe the economy is on a strong growth path.”

The December tax cuts were the largest one-time reduction in the corporate tax rate in U.S. history. The GOP bill, sold on the promise that it would drive up wages and increase job growth, also lowered taxes for the vast majority of Americans, as well as small-business owners.

While Trump often claims credit for the lower black unemployment rate — touting it in his State of the Union address in January and even tweeting a CNBC story about Johnson’s comments Friday — the brightening economic outlook preceded his presidency. The black unemployment rate had steadily declined during Barack Obama’s two terms, from nearly 17 percent in 2010, after the recession, down to 7.8 percent by the time Trump entered office in January 2017.

“Most of the programmatic work was set into motion before the last administration was leaving,” said Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP’s Washington bureau.

Some economists criticized Johnson’s rosy assessment of the economic picture for black Americans.

“A 6.9 percent unemployment is perhaps in a historical sense something to be happy about, but if the white unemployment rate were at 6.9 percent, we would consider this catastrophic and be very alarmed,” said Darrick Hamilton, an economics and urban policy professor at The New School.

Hamilton noted that the structural nature of work has changed drastically since the government began tracking employment statistics, with very different implications today in regard to job security, wages and retirement benefits.

“Work is more precarious today than it was in the past, and in particular, black individuals are more likely to be in precarious employment scenarios with jobs that face greater wage and work-hour volatility,” Hamilton said. “Bob Johnson’s in the billionaire’s club with Donald Trump, so it’s not surprising that they align in their vision on labor.”

Johnson, who’s been friendly with Trump through the years, said he had met with Trump at his golf club in New Jersey shortly after his win when the president-elect offered Johnson a cabinet position.

“I thought I would meet to see if there’s common ground with someone most in the black community might call an enemy,” Johnson told NBC at the time. “It was clearly based on the respect two businessmen would give each other.”

Johnson reiterated Friday that he turned down the cabinet position because he didn’t want to work for the government. He said he continues to have access to top administration officials -- including Trump himself during a meeting last week in Florida -- who he speaks with regularly about improving the economic lives of African Americans. Among the issues he said he's engaged them on are encouraging black workers to save for retirement and keeping black-owned banks solvent so poor communities would have access to capital.

Johnson, a Democrat and supporter of Hillary Clinton, had previously penned an essay on how African American voters should respond to the “tectonic political rift” resulting in Trump’s election.

“Why shouldn't we, as Black voters, reject the notion that we are locked into one party which undoubtedly limits and dilutes our voting power? We should, instead, use the power of our vote to support and elect whichever party that best serves our interests,” Johnson wrote.

He went on to quote former representative William Lacy Clay Sr. (D-Mo.), who formed the Congressional Black Caucus in 1971: ""Black people have no permanent friends, no permanent enemies, just permanent interests.""","(1, 'employment/wages')"

And President Trump, as has become his habit, wasted little time in tweeting boastfully about the new data.

But this has become an exercise in cherry-picking and selective memory. It’s worth taking a step back to evaluate how we got here and who did the heavy lifting. In fact, it was President Obama who inherited an economy in catastrophic freefall, whose stewardship pulled the auto industry back from the brink and ushered the nation out of the Great Recession. Job growth in the last 20 months of the Obama administration was actually better than in the first 20 months of the Trump administration.

But we need to ask a bigger question: What’s the measure of a strong economy?

Is it simply the number of jobs created or a certain level of GDP growth? These are certainly important–low unemployment is obviously better than high unemployment. But is that enough? To whom are the benefits of economic growth flowing? Are these new jobs family-sustaining?

There is plenty of evidence that this is a strong economy primarily for those already in a privileged position. As a recent Washington Post headline put it: “America is richer than ever, but most Americans aren’t.”","(1, 'employment/wages')"

These projections — from Moody’s Analytics, Oxford, and Yale economist Ray Fair -- gauge things like the unemployment rate and income growth to predict the election’s outcome. Three of the leading models show Trump winning easily in 2020.

“He was delighted by those stories. He’s been very interested in them,” said Larry Kudlow, director of the White House National Economic Council, arguing they reflect a “middle class worker boom"" under Trump.

Engulfed in an impeachment inquiry and facing eroding support, Trump has turned to the strength of the U.S. economy as a sign that he is likely to be reelected. Since World War II, no U.S. president has lost reelection when the unemployment rate was below 7.4 percent. No president has even run for reelection when the jobless rate was as low as it is now – 3.6 percent.

Trump will soon test this precedent. His poll numbers remain very weak, and his support in suburbs has eroded steadily. A number of political experts say traditional measures of economic success may not prove decisive enough for voters to give Trump a second term.

On Tuesday, one day before the House of Representatives begins public impeachment hearings, Trump plans to give a speech in New York on trade and economic policy, potentially setting up a contrast with Democrats over priorities heading into next year. A White House spokesman disputed that Trump has poor approval ratings, pointing to polling from the 2016 election that he said incorrectly demonstrated the president’s unpopularity.

“President Trump has created the hottest economy in modern history, and you can be certain that it will be a persistent theme emanating from the Trump campaign,” said Kayleigh McEnany, Trump’s national press secretary, in a statement.

But it is far from clear whether Trump can bank on the economy for his reelection. Political scientists note electoral models based on the economy may miss crucial factors, like rising health care costs, as well as how voters view the personal behavior of the president.

State elections earlier this week may have also underscored the president’s political danger, as Republicans suffered embarrassing losses even in Kentucky and Virginia, where economic growth remains relatively strong. And signs of voter discontent with the president have emerged in crucial swing states, including over health care.

""Typically, these sorts of models include only economic variables, plus some measure of incumbency. The problem is that those aren’t the only things that matter,” said Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University. “They leave out so much, including what voters think of a president’s honesty and trustworthiness, as well as whether they agree on his policies on issues like health care, the environment and a whole range of things.”

About 44 percent of voters say the economy has improved during the Trump administration, according to a recent Washington Post-ABC News poll. But in “Blue Wall” states Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, voters give Trump a -21 percentage point net rating on health care, according to a poll released this week by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Cook Political Report. This tension has made it hard for some forecasters to predict how Trump might fare.

Democratic lawmakers and a number of experts also dispute that the economy gives Trump a decisive political advantage. They point out that bankruptcies in farm country are rising and wage growth has remained sluggish. More Americans are homeless or without health insurance over the last two years, among other trends that hurt the working class, such as persistent poverty, high income inequality, and a devastating opioid epidemic.

“Given the structural inequities embedded in our society, Democrats’ agenda is as relevant at 3 percent unemployment as it is at 7 percent,” said Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to Joe Biden. “It doesn’t obviate the progressive agenda at all. There are lots of people and lots of places that have been left behind.”

The White House has still received some unambiguously good economic news compared to the summer, when there were growing fears that the economy could be sliding into a recession. Manufacturing output was weakening. Trade tensions with China were at a high. The stock market gyrated wildly. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), echoing many economists, warned of a “coming economic crash.”

But since August, several key variables have gone the administration’s way. The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates, generating additional spending in the economy. Two measures of U.S. business activity, after tanking over the summer, leveled off in the fall. Trade tensions appear to have subsided.

Recent Commerce Department data show the economy is slowing, but it is still growing, appearing to steer clear of a recession for now. Gas prices and inflation are low. The stock market has hit new heights.

At the same time, Trump’s Democratic opponents have increasingly called for far-reaching government interventions in the economy. Kevin Hassett, who recently stepped down as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said Trump will lay out a “second-term agenda” that presses the contrast with Democrats’ economic agenda. White House advisers and congressional Republicans have begun discussing the contours of a second tax cut package.

Trump may turn to pointing to the number of people who have gotten insurance by becoming employed, Hassett said.

“It’s ironic: Typically, it’s at the peak of a financial crisis, when markets are collapsing, that you see demands for radical change,” Hassett said. “He’s going to focus on the state of the economy and a different version of what to do for the next four years.”

White House advisers and Republican allies in Congress believe that Trump can help himself by celebrating the economy’s resurgence. But getting the president to do so may prove difficult. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) said he has urged Trump to talk more about how “the economy is on fire” and not get distracted by other issues, but suggested the president does not always listen to these pleas.

“He always takes it in,"" Scott said of his push to get Trump to focus on the economy, “and then goes and does whatever he wants.”

Some research suggests Trump may be wise to not solely rely on the state of the economy. Sean Freeder, of the University of California, Berkeley, has found that the impact of the president’s economic performance on his reelection bid has diminished over the last several decades as voters increasingly interpret it through a partisan lens where they are likely to approve of a president of their own party.

Voters also tend to base their vote on how the economy performed in the year leading up to the election, rather than evaluating a president’s economic performance over his four-year term, said Matt Grossmann, a political scientist at Michigan State University. That suggests a downturn could still hurt Trump. Grossmann cited the example of Ronald Reagan, who presided over a weak economy in 1982, when the unemployment rate was 10.8 percent. But in November 1984, when Reagan faced voters again, the unemployment rate had fallen to 7.2 percent.","(0, 'GDP')"

In particular, he used the NAS report to support his claim that the American economy is hurt by immigrants.

Here is his reference to the report, in context (emphasis added):

The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers. Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others — have a merit-based immigration system. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America's taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.”

As the chair of the panel of scientists convened to write that report and one of the consultants who analyzed the effect of immigration on government budgets, we can state unequivocally that this was not our conclusion. Our report looked at the evidence from all sides and found that the economic and fiscal consequences of immigration are generally positive, or at least not likely to be negative. How, then, can the report be used to argue the opposite?

It’s possible precisely because we did examine the evidence from all sides. President Trump took advantage of a rhetorical vulnerability inherent in scientific evaluation: Because we presented evidence from an array of sources, someone who seeks to support a particular position can dig out findings or statistics to support the conclusion he or she prefers. President Trump, or his speechwriters, cherry-picked some of our results related to government budgets and ignored the overall positive impact that immigrants have on our economy (a positive impact that in turn supports the health of public finances). To redress the imbalance, we provide a more comprehensive summary here.

The panel was convened to address a very complex question: What are the economic and fiscal consequences of immigration? This is a difficult question because immigration affects virtually every aspect of the economy and, moreover, because outcomes may vary across time and place. Such temporal and regional differences may reflect the size of immigrant inflows, the characteristics of natives and incoming immigrants, and prevailing economic conditions. Further, some processes (such as the expense of educating the school-age children of immigrants) are set in motion immediately upon immigrant arrival, while others (such as the labor market and fiscal returns on that investment when the child becomes a working adult) unfold over many years. Our panel gathered the evidence, looked at the data, and sought to do justice to the full range and complexity of the issues. Here are some of our major findings.

Immigrants are more skilled and educated than you probably think

First of all, many of us have an outdated idea of the level and kind of immigration occurring today. Since the 1990s, more immigrants have been arriving every year — but the size of these flows relative to the total population has stabilized. Moreover, the new arrivals, though still less educated on average compared with native-born persons, are more educated and come from a more diverse set of countries of origin than the immigrants arriving at the end of the 20th century (see the chart below for the educational distribution of recent immigrants over time). Indeed, today’s immigrants are more likely to have education beyond college than the native-born.

That observation includes both legally authorized and unauthorized immigrants. Conventional data sources do not permit us to break this down further, but some data is available on the unauthorized immigrants; and here, too, many of us have inaccurate views, particularly relating to how large these flows are. The population of unauthorized immigrants has indeed increased, almost doubling since 1995, to a total of about 11 million today. However, the annual net inflow of new unauthorized immigrants has essentially stopped since 2009: It’s been at or below zero since that year, according to the Pew Research Center.

What about impacts on wages and employment? Over all, when measured over a period of 10 years or more, there is little evidence of a negative effect of immigration on the wages or employment of natives overall. When there was evidence of negative impacts, they were mostly visited upon prior immigrants and those natives with the lowest levels of skills and education — those lacking a high school degree. This is likely the section of the report referred to in the president’s speech, but even here the research produced a range of evidence and was far from unanimous in finding negative effects.

The panel looked across the relevant studies at estimates of what would happen to the wages of the least educated native-born Americans if immigration raised the total supply of labor in the US by 1 percent. Those studies came to a range of conclusions —from a decrease in the wages of these workers of 1.7 percent to no effect to a modestly positive increase of 0.1 percent. What’s more, while not an issue examined directly by our panel, most research suggests that the primary source of worsening wage outcomes for the lowest skilled among US workers is technological change, not immigration.

No evidence of a penalty for native-born workers with a high school degree

Moreover, we found virtually no indication that immigration adversely affected the wages or employment of native-born, high school–educated workers, the people whose economic problems are sometimes pointed to as a reason for curbing immigration — and whose economic angst played a part in fueling Trump’s successful presidential bid. Again, the major reason for negative trends for this group appears to be technological change. A more surefire strategy to raise wages of less skilled workers than restricting immigration is to raise their skill levels by investing more in education and training.

Our report also found that immigration produced many concrete economic benefits. A strongly supported finding of the report is that immigration is integral to the nation’s economic growth. The inflow of labor supplied by immigrants has helped the United States avoid the problems of other economies, such as Japan’s, that have stagnated as a result of unfavorable demographics — particularly the effects of an aging workforce and reduced consumption of housing and other durable goods by older residents.

In addition, the infusion of human capital by high-skilled immigrants has boosted the nation’s capacity for innovation, entrepreneurship, and technological change. Research suggests, for example, that immigrants to the US have substantially raised the number of patents granted per capita, which ultimately contributes to productivity growth. The prospects for long-run growth in the United States would be considerably dimmed without the contributions of high-skilled immigrants.

Moreover, in shutting the doors to lower-skilled immigrants, the nation would lose their many economic contributions, such as their role in making goods and services like child care, house cleaning and repair, food preparation, and construction more available and affordable.

The question of whether immigration costs native-born taxpayers extra is trickier

How do these impacts on economic growth relate to the question of how immigration affects taxpayers? In general, the stronger economic growth is, the healthier government budgets are: Tax revenues go up as incomes and profits rise, and expenditures on need-based public programs go down. We would be sacrificing these benefits if we did not have immigration. But what of the narrower issue of whether immigrants receive more in benefits than they pay in taxes right now? Setting aside their contributions to overall growth, are immigrants a fiscal boon or burden?

It is important to consider this question in context. We are a debtor nation — that’s what the existence of the widely discussed budget deficit means. This in turn means that the “average American” is a fiscal burden, receiving more in benefits than he or she pays in taxes. Thus, our report includes estimates suggesting that a fiscal shortfall exists for both natives and immigrants. From that narrow perspective, President Trump’s reference was not technically in error — but it was misleading because he neglected to mention there is also a shortfall for the native-born as well as immigrants.

Whether immigrants are an even worse deal than natives for government budgets depends on how we account for government spending on things that do not necessarily cost the government more to provide when the population increases — notably, defense spending and interest payments on the debt.

If these costs are attributed equally to immigrants and natives on a per capita basis, immigrants appear costlier to government budgets than do the native-born. Our analysis of the data under this assumption found that immigrants accounted for 17.6 percent of the population and 22.4 percent of the deficit; in contrast, natives accounted for 82.4 percent of the population and 77.6 percent of the deficit.

However, if the costs of items like national defense and interest payments on the debt are excluded for immigrants, on the rationale that an additional immigrant does not cause these costs to increase, the results are different. Under that assumption, immigrants instead help native taxpayers by sharing the burden of paying for these collective costs while not increasing their level.

Here’s one way to think about this kind of government spending, which plays a central part in our analysis: Deporting immigrants or reducing annual quotas would probably not reduce defense spending or interest payments, so such a policy would not lift the burden that foes of immigration say non-immigrants are bearing. Indeed, natives would be negatively affected to the extent that they would have fewer people to share those costs with.

States may bear some costs that the federal government later recoups — an argument for fairer cost sharing, not immigration restrictions

When thinking about fiscal impacts, it is also important to realize that a snapshot of today gives a limited picture. That is why the report also looked at tax and benefit flows over time, observing an immigrant from arrival and projecting his taxes and benefits and that of his or her descendants over the next 75 years. From this perspective, does the arrival of an additional immigrant help or hurt?

Again, the answer depends on what we consider the costs of an immigrant, but it also depends on future government budgets and the characteristics of future immigrants. In most of the scenarios in the report, immigrants and their descendants are a net fiscal benefit. Indeed, second-generation children are fiscal powerhouses, out-earning and out-contributing their native-born peers. The nation’s investment in public education and other services for them is more than paid back over time.

The tax partnership between the federal and local levels of government deserves some attention here, because of the asymmetry of costs and benefits. More of the long-run fiscal benefits of immigrants accrue to the federal Treasury through the tax payments of adult immigrants and their grown children. In contrast, more of the short-run costs of immigrants are borne at the state and local level, principally in the form of education expenses for their children that train more productive workers and taxpayers for the future. This creates a disconnect in time between the local costs (sooner) and the federal benefits (later).

Policymakers should recognize that in high-immigration states, the costs of educating the children of immigrants could have negative impacts on state and local government budgets. Because the federal Treasury will later benefit from this, a larger federal role in shouldering these costs might make sense.

Finally, the historical data showing that immigrant flows are becoming better educated — as educational attainment rises in immigrant-sending regions — is relevant to fiscal impacts. If this trend continues, the fiscal impacts of foreign-born persons relative to natives will likely continue to improve.

In short, the panel’s comprehensive examination of the data on this contentious subject revealed many important benefits of immigration — including on economic growth, innovation, and entrepreneurship. And it found little to no negative effects on the overall wages or employment of native-born workers in the long term. Where negative wage impacts have been detected, native-born high school dropouts and prior immigrants are most likely to be affected. But even there, the evidence is far from unanimous in finding negative effects for natives.

The fiscal picture is more complex, and depends in part on how one allocates costs associated with government expenditure on defense and the national debt. Under a reasonable scenario in which those costs are not attributed to immigrants, immigrants are a fiscal boon overall, but there are negative effects evident at the state level when the costs of educating the children of immigrants are included.

On the other hand — importantly — these children of immigrants go on to become some of the most positive fiscal contributors in the population.

The CEO of industrial giant Honeywell believes that the U.S. economy is poised for a surge under the Trump administration. President Trump’s pro-growth plan to lower corporate taxes and streamline regulation, says Cote, has energized the business world. “I’ve talked to dozens of big- and small-company CEOs since the election,” says Cote. “And I’m seeing a big improvement in animal spirits. Before, the attitude was, ‘Things will muddle along, so we’ll muddle along with it.’ Now the herd is saying, ‘Things are looking up. We don’t want to miss out on this, so it’s time to ramp up investment.’ ”

Such a shift in momentum can be powerful, asserts the veteran executive. “We needed some kind of a spark,” says Cote. “And the spark was the change that occurred because of the election.”

Indeed, it’s not just Fortune 500 CEOs who have viewed the U.S. economy as primed for a breakout since Donald J. Trump’s surprise victory on Nov. 8. Small-business optimism has spiked. In its December survey, the National Federation of Independent Business registered an astounding 38 percentage-point jump from November in the portion of business owners who expect better conditions going forward—from 12% to 50%.

The most obvious scorecard of confidence in Trumponomics, of course, is the stock market. And the huge Trump Rally in equities clearly indicates that investors are betting that the new President’s policies will recharge corporate earnings. Since Election Day, the S&P 500 has risen more than 8%, adding some $1.4 trillion in value, and the manufacturing-heavy Dow Jones industrial average breached the historic 20,000-point threshold and kept climbing. After Trump said in early February that he was going to “announce something phenomenal on taxes in the next two to three weeks,” the indexes leaped again to close at new highs.

The market rally assumes that the Trump administration can make good on its early promises to raise America’s annual growth rate by gigantic proportions—from the dreary 2% of recent years to a robust 3% to 4%. That may just be doable, say a number of veteran economists, if Trump can deliver lower regulations and taxes without derailing the economy in some other way. “It’s not in the bag, but it borders on the likely,” says Allan Meltzer, a legendary monetary-policy specialist and onetime Reagan adviser.

That’s what could go right. But there is much that could go very, very wrong.

Even many of Trump’s ardent supporters in the business community fear that core elements of his platform could steer the economy in a far darker direction. The biggest risk is trade. Trump is advocating protectionist policies that could reverse the decades-old march toward open borders that has enriched both the U.S. and its partners, potentially igniting a global trade war. As he vowed he would on the campaign trail, Trump has already killed the Trans-Pacific Partnership—the trade agreement negotiated by the Obama administration that would have lowered barriers to U.S. exports with Japan, Australia, and nine other nations.

Conservative economists who support the tax and regulatory portion of his agenda are ex­tremely wary about his instincts on trade. Trump has threatened Mexico and China with tariffs ranging from 20% to 45%—a strategy theoretically intended to lower our trade deficits with the two largest exporters to the U.S. that could backfire bigly. “The big risk to his success is a trade war,” says Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the president of the American Action Forum and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office under George W. Bush.

But Trump’s protectionist proclivities are hardly the only concern. His harsh anti-­immigration stance is another downer for growth—with the potential to drive away or deport millions of workers who are the bedrock of the farming and construction industries, as well as to surrender the U.S.’s dominant position in the global talent wars by restricting visas for engineers and programmers who help power America’s R&D.

“I talk to him every day,” says Trump’s friend Tom Barrack. “He thinks it’s a revolution, and all the tumult is normal.”

Therein lies the promise and peril of the Trump economy: Put simply, America has never witnessed such a contradictory mix of free-market and antigrowth policies in the White House. Or a President who operates in such an unorthodox and unpredictable way.

Bolstering the case for pessimism is Trump’s hair-trigger temperament and penchant for launching scorched-earth attacks on a daily basis—including on world leaders from whom the self-declared master dealmaker will need cooperation to deliver the export-boosting concessions that are the centerpiece of his “America First” economic plan. In addition to antagonizing China and Mexico, the President has lambasted Chancellor Angela Merkel for “ruining Germany.” He even berated Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia, a close U.S. ally, in a heated phone conversation.

Yet those incidents were but minor controversies in the chaos of the Trump administration’s first few weeks. The Twitter-happy President lashed out at the “so-called judge” who suspended Trump’s controversial immigration ban on people entering the U.S. from seven ­Muslim-majority nations, as well as the federal appeals court judges who upheld the ruling. Trump also found time to go after department-store chain Nordstrom after the retailer dropped his daughter Ivanka’s clothing line because of falling sales, tweeting that she had “been treated so unfairly.”

So much meshuggaas emanating from the Oval Office has raised very real questions about execution risk on all issues, including the economy. The hastily imposed Muslim ban in particular infuriated congressional Democrats, limiting chances for compromise even in areas like fixing roads and bridges, an initiative with bipartisan support. ­Although Republicans control both houses of Congress, it’s unclear how much of the Trump agenda will actually become law. For ­example, ­financing his reductions in corporate levies depends heavily on the passage of an extremely complex “border adjustment tax,” or BAT, that the Senate Republican leadership has yet to endorse.

“After the election, we were looking for areas of common ground, such as an infrastructure program,” says Rep. John Delaney, a Maryland Democrat. “But now with the way the administration is behaving, the way they throw things out, people in Congress have gotten a lot more pessimistic. You need reliable parties at the table to negotiate a big, complicated tax and infrastructure plan. You have to ask, Are they going to be serious?”

Trump’s sudden shifts in policy—and the difficulty in ever ascertaining whether he is bluffing or serious about his more dire threats—are causing widespread uncertainty. And if business hates anything, it’s uncertainty. “I think things are moving in the right direction, but I’m seeing lots of nervousness,” says Tom Barrack, chairman of real estate investment manager Colony Capital and one of Trump’s closest friends. “I’m seeing totally polarized views on what’s going to happen, from one camp believing things are going to be great, and an opposing camp predicting disaster.”

Some of Trump’s proposals are already undermining his principal goals. His tariff threats against Mexico, for instance, have helped push the peso down 10% against the dollar since Nov. 8. That’s made U.S. exports of everything from auto parts to appliances a lot more expensive across our southern border, slowing the exports that Trump vows to grow.

Both Trump’s conflicted policy and his erratic execution have caused some on Wall Street to have second thoughts. For example, Ray Dalio, founder of the world’s biggest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, praised Trump’s policies in an essay on LinkedIn shortly after the election. In late January, he hedged his position in a note to clients and warned that he had become “more concerned that the damaging effects of President Donald Trump’s populist policies may overwhelm the benefits of his pro-business agenda.” In early February, Goldman Sachs sent a note to clients warning that “risks are less positively tilted than they appeared shortly after the election.”

Danger is also lurking in the buoyant stock market. The big gains since the election have made pricey shares even more expensive, driving the trailing price/earnings ratio of the S&P 500 to 25 in mid-February—well above the historical average of 16. That leave equities extremely vulnerable to deep declines if investors begin to sense that Trump can’t deliver the GDP gains that he’s promising.

It’s important to remember that it is still early days for the Trump administration. There’s plenty of time for the new President and his advisers to refine their approach to governing and, in economic matters, to deliver his promised reforms. Speculating on the odds of that happening, however, is a fool’s game. For now, we can focus only on what he has said he wants to do.

To better understand the specifics—and the unknowns—of Trump’s policies and how they’re likely to drive or slow the economy, Fortune interviewed dozens of economists, policy experts, former government officials, and business leaders.

What does Trump think of the turmoil he has caused so far? “I talk to him every day,” says Barrack. “He thinks it’s a revolution, and all the tumult is normal. He’s not bothered at all by all the divisions in Congress and the electorate.”

The near future of the American economy will depend on which side of the scale predominates under Trump: free-business initiatives or protectionist policies. Corporate tax cuts and regulatory relief will weigh heavily on the plus side. But an upheaval in trade would swamp all the potential gains from slashing regulations and taxes.

Trump’s team appears divided on trade. Commerce Secretary nominee Wilbur Ross and White House National Trade Council chief Peter Navarro are in the protectionist camp, while Treasury ­Secretary Steve Mnuchin and top economic adviser Gary Cohn, the longtime No. 2 to Lloyd Blankfein at Goldman Sachs, seem wary of disrupting free-trade agreements. Keep in mind that Trump’s pledge to protect workers from cheap, job-killing imports from China and Mexico was a key factor in helping propel him to the White House.

As quickly as things appear to be moving now, it’s important to remember as well that negotiating big trade deals is a lengthy process. If Trump can significantly boost growth in the next two or three quarters, America will be in a far better mood. With payrolls and wages waxing, the pressure to build trade barriers will abate, and Trump could declare victory by trumpeting relatively minor concessions. That’s probably the best-case scenario for achieving a healthy balance of policies. “If Trump can achieve consistent 3% to 4% expansion in GDP, nothing else matters,” says Gary Hufbauer, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a stern critic of Trump’s views on trade.

Trump has a realistic shot at reaching that ambitious goal, though it will require implementing his unambiguously pro-business policies and mostly scuttling the rest. The President inherited a so-so economy that grew at just 1.6% in 2016 and has expanded at an average of 2.3% annually since the nadir of the Great Recession in mid-2009. Although the unemployment rate is now just 4.9% and the economy has created 11 million jobs in the past seven years, roughly an equal number of working-age Americans have ceased looking.

Many economists argue that a small pool of employable labor and an aging population, capped by low levels of immigration, have helped create a “new normal” that confines America to a plodding GDP growth rate of 2% or so. Trump isn’t buying it. In the view of his economic team, the roadblock is a dearth of capital investment. They argue that Obama hobbled business with a host of expensive regulations in banking, energy, and manufacturing that forced CEOs into a defensive posture, in which they shunned risk taking and hoarded cash.

Whatever the reason, it’s undeniable that capex in the U.S. has languished and that a healthy dose of new investment is absolutely essential to lifting America’s growth trajectory. The crucial measure of capex, private nonresidential fixed investment, stalled in the third quarter of 2014. Since then, spending on new plants, labs, and research facilities has increased less than 0.5% a year, adjusted for inflation, creating a substantial drag on GDP.

Trump wants to jolt the U.S. economy back into action. He predicts a virtuous cycle in which his tax plan allows companies to raise their profits from new investments, driving them to boost spending. Then new machinery and tech breakthroughs will raise worker productivity and, hence, wages and employment. At the same time, lifting burdensome regulations should also recharge capex across the economy.

So let’s go deeper into Trump’s plan to jump-start things. His three big pro-growth initiatives are corporate tax reform, regulatory reduction, and infrastructure renewal. We’ll start with taxes.

Trump aims to greatly enhance the competitiveness of the U.S. economy by radically lowering the corporate rate. America’s 35% federal corporate tax rate is the highest of any major developed nation, at least statutorily. In practice, U.S. corporations take advantage of so many write-offs that the effective tax rate is much closer to par with that of other advanced economies. Still, tax reform has a great potential to juice GDP. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has identified heavy corporate levies as the most antigrowth of all tax categories.

Two plans are now in competition. The first is the relatively general platform that Trump issued during the campaign and hasn’t updated. The second is the more comprehensive House Republican proposal. The two are remarkably similar, with one huge exception: The House plan includes a complex, controversial measure called the border adjustment tax, or BAT, which has the potential to raise a massive $1 trillion in tax revenue. More on that in a moment.

On personal taxes, both plans go big on simplification, reducing the number of brackets from seven to three and lowering the top rate from 39.6% to 33%. And on the business side, the House and Trump plans would both greatly reduce the corporate tax rate. Trump proposes a top federal rate of 15%, one of the lowest levies in the developed world. The House champions a maximum of 20%.

Both plans also propose another historic tax break for businesses, one aimed at raising investment. They would allow companies to write off 100% of all capital investments in the first year instead of expensing them gradually over three to 20 years or more, as required under current law. “It’s crucial because when companies depreciate a $1 million investment over 10 years, they’re really getting a tax break of maybe $750,000 because of inflation,” says Kyle Pomerleau, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a nominally “nonpartisan” think tank with a free-market tilt. “If they write it off in year one, they get the entire $1 million as a deduction.” That difference substantially raises the future returns on new plants and equipment.

The crucial difference between the two plans is the BAT—a revolutionary new border tax that resembles the VAT, or value-added tax, levied by virtually all of America’s trading partners. The BAT, however, is a different animal.

How does it work? Whereas the VAT is essentially a sales tax that’s eventually tacked onto the price of a product or service, the BAT is more complicated. It would raise and lower corporate income taxes, increasing levies on importers and providing big credits to exporters. Today importers pay a 35% rate on their profits. Under the BAT, they would pay the new rate—let’s call it 20%—on the entire revenue they collect selling, for example, Japanese cell phones or French perfume in the U.S. That would more than double the taxes paid on a $30,000 car with a 20% profit margin—from $2,100 to $6,000.

By contrast, U.S. exporters would get an added deduction for the full revenue collected on the products they sell abroad. So they would go from paying 35% on their profits in Germany or Japan to receiving a big rebate. Supporters of the BAT claim that it will cause an already-strong dollar to further strengthen, lowering the cost of imports, so that foreign nations would sell the same volume of goods in the U.S. as they do now, and that the big rebates would exactly offset the drag on exports from the higher dollar, leaving foreign sales unchanged as well.

The House bill pairs the BAT with what’s called a “territorial” tax regime. Today U.S. companies pay the 35% rate on all income, earned anywhere in the world. Most other major nations impose their national tax only on profits booked at home. The Irish subsidiary of a French drugmaker pays tax only in Ireland on the products it sells in Ireland. The House plan would change the U.S. from an outlier by adopting the global standard of a territorial tax.

The combination of a BAT and territorial tax has important virtues. U.S. companies would no longer have an incentive to switch their headquarters to low-tax nations through notorious “inversions.” And because import revenues are fully taxable, it would no longer make sense for importers to manipulate pricing to inflate the “costs” of goods sent to the U.S., a common practice for reducing profits, and thus lowering U.S. tax payments. Nor would U.S. companies have any reason to park hoards of cash in foreign subsidiaries, where $2.5 trillion in unrepatriated profits sit today.

The BAT is a levy the likes of which the U.S. has never seen—and there is understandable resistance to introducing such an intricate new system. Trump himself has been waffling on the idea, stating in late January that the BAT was “too complicated,” then seeming to endorse it two weeks later. Big retailers such as Walmart, Target, and Rite Aid are adamantly opposed to the BAT, arguing that we don’t really know if the dollar would appreciate enough to offset the tax levies on clothing and furniture from China. Nor has the Senate Finance Committee or Majority Leader Mitch McConnell endorsed the BAT.

If the BAT isn’t enacted, it’s likely that either one of the two pillars of Trump’s tax overhaul will have to go, or that both the immediate expensing of capex and a corporate tax rate cut will be scaled back to lower the cost of reform. On paper, the BAT is crucial to making the numbers work.

The president’s assault on regulations has two major parts: His pledge to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and the campaign to roll back costly red tape that hobbles energy producers, banks, and manufacturers. The promise on Obamacare is a kind of microcosm of the Trump agenda: Favoring markets rather than mandates is sound policy in theory. But the unknowns about timing and the details of what Trump will propose are creating tremendous uncertainty among patients and providers.

Although both Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan claim that replacing the ACA is their top priority, the Republicans and the administration haven’t agreed on a plan, nor on a deadline for when a replacement bill will be introduced. It’s simply not clear if Trump will keep his pledge not to disrupt coverage for the 20 million people who gained coverage via Obamacare. “Whether he will stabilize Obamacare for now or blow it up by getting rid of the individual mandate or cutting payments to insurers that cover losses is still ­unknown,” says Larry Levitt, a senior official at the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Right now, the stability scenario looks more likely. The administration is actually moving to strengthen the ACA. It’s imposing new regulations that maintain a stronger balance between healthy and sick folks in the insurance pools. The goal is limiting enrollment periods to cure an Obamacare syndrome: a flood of patients who game the system by signing up only when they’re seriously ill and dropping coverage as soon as they recover.

Still, health care providers are fretting that when it finally arrives, Trumpcare will savage their businesses. Under the ACA, the nation’s hospitals agreed to big reductions in payments from seniors and the poor through Medicare and Medicaid in exchange for the expanded coverage that would bring them far more paying customers and reduce uncompensated care. That arrangement has greatly bolstered their finances. But if Obamacare is repealed and the Medicare and Medicaid payments aren’t restored to their old levels, America’s hospitals will face enormous losses. A study by industry groups puts the figure at a staggering $200 billion.

Outside of the ACA, Trump is beginning a regulatory rollback unmatched in generations. The field is vast and varied, and estimates of the annual costs of federal red tape range widely, from the Office of Management and Budget’s estimate of $250 billion to the Competitive Enterprise Institute’s $1.8 trillion. Whatever the true figure, the number and burden of new rules rose sharply during the Obama years. From 2009 to 2016, Obama implemented about 300 regulations costing more than $100 million annually, compared with 120 during the George W. Bush years.

Trump has pledged to eliminate 75% of existing federal rules. In reality, that won’t come close to happening. It can take years of public hearings and lawsuits to eliminate regulations already on the books. Still, he’s already wielding his pen as a giant eraser.

On Jan. 30, Trump issued an executive order requiring that in the future, any executive branch agency or department must eliminate two rules for every new one it issues. In addition, the regulations added and repealed can’t add to the agency’s total cost of regulation, a rule that will be enforced by the OMB. He has also imposed a moratorium on the 2,596 proposed-but-not-implemented regulations.

Infrastructure renewal should be a prime area of cooperation between Trump and the Democrats. But the two sides have highly divergent approaches, especially on funding. During the campaign, Trump called for $550 billion in federal spending. The new administration hasn’t proposed a specific plan. But Trump is on the record advocating that most of the spending be channeled into partnerships between government and private companies. In a position paper written for the campaign, Ross and Navarro proposed granting tax breaks equal to 87% for up to $187 billion in equity that companies invest in infrastructure projects. The idea is that those public-private partnerships would leverage that equity into $1 trillion in new infrastructure spending and that payroll taxes on newly created jobs and contractors’ profits would cover the full costs.

In practice, the Ross-Navarro plan won’t nearly do the job. Many of America’s roads and bridges don’t have tolls or any source of revenue, and projects that do are mostly owned by the government. The partnerships could finance pipelines or private water systems. But they won’t work for most of our crumbling highways, commuter rail networks, and the aging electrical grid, all of which are in desperate need of funding. “For the vast majority of projects, direct public funding is needed,” says Marcia Hale, president of Building America’s Future, a group that champions a bold offensive on infrastructure.

“With the way the administration is behaving,” says one democrat, “you have to ask, are they going to be serious?”

Trump’s public-private concept contrasts ­sharply with a new proposal from New York’s Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader. Schumer wants to spend $1 trillion in federal funds—aided by a tiny dollop of private money—on projects stretching from bridges to schools and veterans’ hospitals. His counterpart, McConnell, trashes the Schumer plan as far too expensive.

A possible compromise is a bill sponsored by Rep. Delaney, which gets around the spending issue by tapping the proceeds from repatriation of foreign profits. Both the House Republican and Trump tax plans mandate that companies bring back all of their approximately $2.5 trillion in profits parked abroad. It’s not a choice; they have to do it.

Delaney would use the proceeds of $170 billion for grants to states, municipalities, and federal agencies. That seed money could then be augmented by matching funds and bond offerings to finance $1 trillion in new projects and renovations. The bill has a number of Republican cosponsors and broad bipartisan support. It’s not clear that Trump and McConnell will embrace the Delaney plan. If they don’t, a standoff on infrastructure will loom.

Three Key Economic Policy Questions

Will Trump go to BAT?

One Republican tax-reform plan calls for a complicated new levy called the border adjustment tax. It could raise $1 trillion to offset corporate tax cuts. But U.S. retailers hate it. What’s the right way to finance an infrastructure building boom?

Trump has advocated public-private partnerships, which aren’t practical for many projects. The Democrats are pushing a $1 trillion federal public-works campaign. A possible compromise: Use the tax windfall from repatriating stranded overseas profits of U.S. companies to fund the much-needed investment. Is Trump serious about starting a trade war?

The President has threatened to impose tariffs on countries like Mexico and China if they don’t lower barriers to U.S. exports. But odds are that a full-on breakout of protectionism would cause the value of the dollar to spike, shrink-exports, and hobble growth.

Nothing in Trump’s rhetoric or his actions has polarized the nation more than his stance on immigration. And his views on the subject threaten both the high and low ends of the U.S. workforce. A pair of draft executive orders leaked to the press contain two provisions that could greatly restrict immigration. The first directs the Department of Homeland Security to issue a rule stating that any immigrant deemed likely to receive public assistance, such as Medicaid or children’s health insurance, cannot be admitted to the U.S. That rule would grant the officials wide latitude to possibly shrink today’s inflow of legal immigrants, already at a low level of around 1 million a year. That would be bad for growth. Research has shown that immigrants are disproportionately likely to start new businesses. A study last year by the National Foundation for American Policy found that 51% of startups in the U.S. worth over $1 billion were founded by entrepreneurs born abroad.

The second rule could limit one of the tech industry’s best sources of talent. It’s the H-1B visa program allowing foreigners in “specialty occupations” to work temporarily in the U.S., frequently in computers and engineering. That’s one reason Silicon Valley despises Trump’s stance on immigration. Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL), and more than 100 other companies sued Trump to stop his ban on immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations.

Today, H-1B applicants are chosen by a lottery, and the annual number is capped at around 85,000. It isn’t clear that Trump’s new policies would cut that number, but the draft states that U.S. policy should “prioritize the protection of American workers.” A new House bill with bipartisan support would raise the minimum salary companies need to pay H-1B workers from $60,000 to $100,000, a measure designed to prevent highly skilled immigrants from taking jobs from U.S. workers. The Trump team is pointing in the same, anti-H-1B direction.

The most menacing threat to the economy under Trump by far is trade policy. Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute reckons that imposing high tariffs would shrink the $5 trillion in goods and services the U.S. purchases at home and sells around the globe by 5%, causing a 1% drop in GDP. After the initial shrinkage, a trade war could explode. And even if our partners don’t retaliate right away, America’s multinationals would live in fear that formerly open borders would soon be barricaded with tariffs. Spreading protectionism is also likely to hurt equity prices. “That combination would chill investment,” says Hufbauer.

For decades, the U.S. has benefited mightily from the spread of free trade. For example, our exports in goods to Mexico have risen 259% adjusted for inflation since NAFTA was enacted in 1994, to $231 billion in 2016. Over the same period, Mexico’s exports to the U.S. jumped 345%, creating a $63 billion trade deficit—which by the way, mainly consists of our imports of Mexican crude oil and petroleum products.

Does that trade gap, or the bigger one with China, hurt the U.S.? From an economic point of view, just the opposite. “It makes no sense for us to make things at home if it costs less to import them,” says Harvard economist Robert Lawrence. “We raise living standards by sending the Chinese airplanes that we exchange for their clothing.”

Mainstream economists mostly agree that although imports can cause acute pain by displacing workers, especially in manufacturing, the economy benefits overall because the cheaper products leave our consumers with more money to spend on other things. Free trade steers capital into sophisticated, high-paying, high-value-added fields where America enjoys a competitive advantage. For example, by creating a single market in North America, NAFTA has encouraged superefficient supply chains where manufacturers produce parts and assemble cars in Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. depending on where costs are lowest—a system that has enhanced the competitiveness of Ford and GM (GM) on world markets.

The Trump team has offered some clues about how it will approach the trade issue. According to statements by Navarro and Ross, the opening gambit consists of shunning multilateral deals and instead negotiating agreements one-on-one with a number of nations, including Japan, the U.K., Canada, and Mexico. The initial offensive won’t focus on limiting imports but on demanding that our partners buy a lot more U.S. goods—with the threat of tariffs providing a spur. That strategy may have some success with China, which enjoys a gigantic $350 billion trade surplus with the U.S.

One possible sticking point in the negotiations: The Trump team doesn’t seem willing to offer more access to U.S. markets, where we protect airlines, forestry, sugar, and a number of other industries and award public projects mostly to the home team. “The idea is that we’ve been ‘stripped naked’ on trade agreements, and we have nothing to give,” says Hufbauer.

That one-way attitude is unlikely to extract significant concessions, according to such experts as Hufbauer and Lawrence. So the question is whether Trump will really unleash the big stick, namely tariffs. If that happens, America’s economy will likely grow not faster but slower.

An outbreak of full-on protectionism could potentially shrink both imports and exports. That’s because when the U.S. slaps, say, a 35% or 45% tariff on Chinese goods, the world will become a far more uncertain place. The Chinese will look for somewhere safe to park their yuan, and the safest currency is the U.S. dollar. Ironically, the flight to safety could drive the dollar far higher, hiking the costs and prices of our exports and hobbling growth.

Now for the most sobering news of all. Even if we escape a trade debacle, the Trump growth plan—for all its virtues—is designed for the short term. Unless we tackle the looming national debt crisis—and quickly—the best case is that the U.S. could grow briskly for a few years. After that, we’re headed for territory that a Medieval cartographer would label “Here Lie Dragons.”

According to the most recent CBO projections, by 2027, interest on the debt alone will triple, to $768 billion, accounting for one dollar in every eight the U.S. spends. And that’s using the rosy assumption that the 10-year Treasury rate reaches only 3.6% in 10 years. In a few years, soaring deficits and debt could prompt foreigners who now own $8 trillion in U.S. government bonds to dump them, forcing up interest rates and choking a Trump recovery.

So far, Trump hasn’t opted to offer any potential plans to solve the long-term debt problem. In his view, job one is getting the economy growing faster. And as for taming deficits, what’s the rush?

That’s a dangerous attitude given the scope of the problem, and one that can’t last long. An immediate issue is how Trump plans to finance his proposed tax cuts. If the U.S. enacts the BAT and deploys the repatriation windfall to pay for infrastructure, the additional rise in future deficits, over and above current projections, could be modest. But if Trump borrows an additional $500 billion in 2019 to finance his stimulus, the deficit will quickly zoom to over $1 trillion, or a gigantic 5% of GDP.

Even Cote of Honeywell, who’s bullish on Trumponomics, is concerned about the President’s lack of concern about deficits. “We can’t keep going the way we are,” says Cote, who served on the 2010 Simpson-Bowles Commission on fiscal reform. “We can’t grow our way out of it. This is a slow-moving freight train that we can see coming from miles way, and shame on us if we don’t do something about it.”

If President Trump suddenly stops picking fights with retailers and federal judges and starts working on a debt-reduction plan instead, that might be the most promising sign of all.

To those who think that President Trump’s economic policy is simply an extended program to make the rich richer, there is another, more subtle possibility. The focus on the rich, while understandable, simplifies and misrepresents Trump’s larger ambition. This is to create an economy that is operating at the outer edges of its productive capacity — one that is exhausting its supply of workers and surplus of goods and services.

It is in this sense that the economy is “hot”; the comparable term in the 1960s and 1970s was the “high- ­pressure” economy. The theory is that only such an economy can force businesses to raise wages and hire marginal employees. Trump is shaping economic policy to realize this vision and, in the process, reap the political rewards of doing so.

There is only one large snag: We tried this in the ’60s and ’70s, and it failed abysmally. It led to double- ­digit inflation, frequent recessions and public demoralization. No matter. Trump is moving toward this sort of inflationary system by raising the economy’s demand and constricting its supply.

Here’s Trump’s check list.

First, pass a large tax cut financed by more borrowing. Check. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will reduce taxes by $1.5 trillion over a decade and be financed by larger deficits.

Second, increase government spending without, of course, offsetting extra demand with higher taxes (see above). Check. The recent budget plan is estimated to raise federal outlays by another $1.5 trillion over a decade.

Third, reduce government regulations, making it easier to begin new investment and construction projects. Check. This, too, would raise demand, though estimating how much is hard.

Fourth, limit competition from foreign workers and businesses by restricting immigration and imports. Check. From the border wall to rescinding Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the administration has been anti-immigrant. Likewise, it has been protectionist; last week Trump announced new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.

These various policies are familiar. What’s less familiar is their collective impact, which (again) is to stimulate demand and shrink supply.

Tight labor markets might well raise wage increases, and these in turn might stimulate higher price increases — and we are then off on a wage-price spiral reminiscent of the ’60s and ’70s. This, of course, won’t be the end of it.

The prospect of higher inflation means that “the Fed and the [Trump] administration are on a collision course,” as my colleague Sebastian Mallaby recently wrote in The Post. The Fed could respond to heightened inflation fears by raising interest rates more than is now expected. Or it could leave current plans unchanged on the hope that inflation won’t worsen. Either way, the economy and stock market could be vulnerable to a significant setback.

Running the economy “hot” is a superficially attractive policy. It promises to deliver the benefits of a strong economy to those who most need them. It suggests that we can enjoy the advantages of “full employment” on a more or less permanent basis. But like many appealing and visionary ideas, its utility breaks down in practice. It may make matters worse.

Traditionally, these policies have been most popular among the liberal left, because less-skilled workers seem to benefit the most. But, inevitably, there’s a backlash against higher inflation that — entailing higher interest rates and, often, recessions — hurts these very same workers. Though the process may be drawn out, it still takes its toll. Trump is either unaware of or indifferent to the contradictions.

At considerable social cost — fluctuating prices, widespread fears of the future — we learned these lessons in the 1970s. Surely we don’t have to learn them again.

At the heart of that order, it put the liberal values of free trade and the rule of law. Over the next seven decades, the order, backed by U.S. power and bolstered by its growing legitimacy among other countries, prevented most economic disputes from escalating into mutually destructive trade wars, let alone military conflict. That allowed even the smallest and poorest countries to develop their social and economic potential without having to worry about predation by stronger neighbors. By taking much of the fear out of the global economy, the U.S.-led order allowed market decisions to be driven by business, not bullying.

Today, that order is under threat. U.S. President Donald Trump has rejected the idea that the world’s economies all benefit when they play by the rules. Instead, he has decided that putting “America first” means withdrawing from supposedly bad deals, on which he believes the system is based. So far, Trump has failed to follow through on his most destructive ideas. But the damage has already begun to show. His administration has hobbled the World Trade Organization, encouraged China and other autocratic regimes to lean on their smaller neighbors for economic loyalty, undercut agreements on tax evasion and climate change, and pushed even major U.S. allies to negotiate free-trade and cross-border investment deals without the United States.

If the United States continues its retreat from economic leadership, it will impose serious pain on the rest of the world—and on itself. Unless the Trump administration chooses to launch a full-blown trade war, the consequences will not come immediately. But a sustained U.S. withdrawal will inevitably make economic growth slower and less certain. The resulting disorder will make the economic well-being of people around the world more vulnerable to political predation and conflict than it has been in decades.

WELCOME TO THE CLUB

One of the great lessons of economic history is that bullying is bad for prosperity. Good institutions—the rule of law, clear property rights, stable means of exchange, efficient tax collection, the provision of public goods, checks on official corruption—are the fundamental prerequisites for sustained economic growth. The benefits of such institutions should not be oversold. They do not lead inexorably to prosperity or democratic freedom. But without them, long-term saving and investment, which form the backbone of growth, cannot be maintained.

The U.S.-led postwar order extended these kinds of institutions to the international economic sphere, at least in part. The best way to think about the rules-based order is as a club that promotes a common set of beliefs to which its members adhere: the ability to export to, import from, and invest in markets around the world should not be determined by military power or alliance structures; other countries’ economic growth should be welcomed, not treated as a threat; property rights should be secure from invasion, expropriation, or theft; and technical knowledge should flow freely, subject to the enforcement of patents and trademarks. Together, these values provide the basis for sustained investment and business relationships, as well as household income growth.

The club offers some shared facilities, for which dues are collected. These start with the institutions founded at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944—the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and what became the World Trade Organization (WTO)—but go far beyond them. The order maintains common systems for settling transactions, converting currencies, invoicing in widely accepted units, and applying tariffs and customs rules. It also establishes forums where experts can meet to discuss specialized topics and groups that set international standards, such as ICANN (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers). Critically, the club’s facilities now include frameworks for settling international commercial disputes.

A sustained U.S. withdrawal will inevitably make economic growth slower and less certain.

The club includes some mutual insurance against both man-made and natural disasters. In part, this takes the form of development assistance and emergency aid, which flow disproportionately to poorer members. But it also involves cooperation in the face of financial crises or economic depression, both of which can spread if the entire community does not work together to fix problems, even if they initially affect only one member. The liquidity provided by the U.S. Federal Reserve in emergencies is essential to such financial firefighting.

The club analogy is not perfect. Although the members are nation-states, underlying each state are millions of people, households, and businesses. These, not the states’ rulers, are the ultimate beneficiaries of the global economic order. That is what gives the liberal order its ethical weight.

LEADING FROM THE MIDDLE

All these attributes are in large part the result of U.S. leadership. But if the United States chairs the club, that does not mean it can issue commands or demand loyalty. Washington cannot force a state to become a member; it can only make membership more attractive than remaining outside the club. Nor can it easily restrict what a member government does within its own country or in areas outside of the order’s agreed values, short of issuing a credible threat to kick that country out of the system. But if such threats come too often or seem too arbitrary, then other members will fear for their own status and band together to resist U.S. pressure. Finally, the United States can collect club dues only to the degree that members think that membership is worth it and that others are paying roughly their fair share.

This reality contradicts the widespread but misguided belief that the United States provides global public goods while others free-ride, let alone Trump’s view that the global system has played American voters for fools. In reality, the United States supplies by itself only two essential aspects of the economic order. First, Washington extends an umbrella of security guarantees and nuclear deterrence over U.S. allies. Second, the U.S. military ensures free navigation of the seas and airspace for commerce, subject to some international rules that are largely set by the United States. Both of these are classic public goods in that one actor, the United States, provides them, and can do so essentially on its own, and every country benefits, whether or not it contributes.

In fact, when it comes to the rest of the order’s institutions and benefits, the United States has often been the one free-riding in recent years. It has frequently failed to pay its dues to international organizations on time, as others do. It has spent a far smaller share of its GDP on aid than other wealthy countries. It has failed to respond adequately to climate change, even as other countries have begun to shift toward greener growth. It has behaved irresponsibly by excessively deregulating its financial system and its mortgage market, despite pressuring other countries to curtail their own growth for the sake of stability.

Other countries are also mostly taking a wait-and-see approach to Trump’s threats to the global economic system.

This reality is the opposite of the concern voiced by Trump’s “America first” slogan. The United States has been given a pass on many responsibilities precisely because it leads the system and other countries want it to keep doing so.

So far, the benefits of U.S. leadership have been large enough that other countries are willing to ignore a certain amount of hypocrisy. But at some point, if the United States goes from occasional free-riding to ostentatiously violating the rules, the system itself will be imperiled. The United States has to want to lead, and the other members have to want it to do so.

Thus, U.S. leadership is not the inevitable result of the relative size of the U.S. economy and the U.S. military. Over the last 70 years, it has persisted even as the share of the world economy made up by the U.S. economy has shrunk from 50 percent to 25 percent. Policymakers should not fear that China or the EU will replace Washington as the global economic leader as their economies surpass that of the United States. So long as the U.S. economy remains very large (which it will) and at the technological frontier (which it probably will), and the United States maintains its commitment to globally attractive values, the country will be capable of remaining the leader.

It is a tribute to the appeal of the liberal rules-based order—and to Washington’s ability to position itself as at least better than the alternative—that U.S. leadership has retained such indulgent support.

DO THEY REALLY MEAN IT?

Washington’s retreat will not immediately send the world into recession. Unless the Trump administration decides to mount an actual trade war with China or Mexico, it may not even do any obvious harm over the next year or two. This is partly because even major economic policies take time to affect economies as a whole. It is also because the global economy is in the midst of an extremely broad and balanced recovery. That breadth makes the current expansion the most resilient of any since at least the 1980s. All the engines of the world economy are running well, mostly without overreliance on debt in either the private or the public sector.

Other countries are also mostly taking a wait-and-see approach to Trump’s threats to the global economic system. The administration’s National Security Strategy, which was released in December, challenges almost all the fundamental aspects of the United States’ global role and the values that the country has professed for the last 70 years. It breaks down the wall between economics and national security and explicitly commits the U.S. government to bilateral bullying instead of enforcing and obeying the rules. Advancing what it calls “principled realism,” the strategy promises to “integrate all elements of America’s national power—political, economic, and military.” The United States will “pursue bilateral trade agreements” rather than broad ones, a recipe for economic coercion rather than cooperation.

Some skepticism over the Trump administration’s course is justified, since past administrations have rarely followed any stated strategy consistently. What is more, even if the document does reflect Trump’s intentions, a number of factors—the midterm elections later this year, unexpected developments from the ongoing investigations into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, pushback from Congress, even reasoned persuasion by the president’s economic advisers and world leaders—could stop the administration from following this mistaken path.

If that strategy really does guide U.S. policy, however, then it will do serious harm. The United States would restrict access to its market in a variety of arbitrary ways, by blocking foreign investment, withdrawing from trade agreements, imposing “buy American” restrictions on government purchases, and politicizing financial supervision and access to international payments systems. Inevitably, given greater political discretion over the economy, some U.S. politicians will demand payments, perhaps even bribes, from companies for proceeding with normal commercial transactions. All but the last already occur to some limited degree, but successive U.S. administrations since World War II have pushed against these tendencies at home and abroad. Reversing that approach would hurt the United States’ economic productivity and its citizens’ purchasing power. At least as important, it wouldn’t stop there. Adopting such policies would encourage autocrats to follow suit and even democratic allies to retaliate in kind.

Finally, the extent of the damage will depend on how willing and able other governments are to uphold the values and structures of the current system: China and the EU, primarily, but also other major economies that have long supported the rules-based order, such as Australia, Canada, Japan, and Mexico. In all likelihood, there will be no immediate disaster, because the system offers benefits to members who voluntarily comply with its rules. Even without the United States, almost all the other members of the order still publicly subscribe to its stated values: open markets, equal treatment of all members for economic purposes, and the peaceful settlement of disputes.

When politicians demand loyalty over objectivity and suppress findings they do not like, they legitimate tactics that were once the preserve of autocrats.

Some of the shift away from U.S. economic leadership predates the Trump administration. Since the global financial crisis, widespread disdain has emerged for the excesses of turbocharged Anglo-American financialized capitalism, especially its unfettered speculative flows and unchecked accumulation of private wealth. In many countries, this backlash has led to greater tolerance for state-owned enterprises (reinforced by China’s example of state-led growth), the protection of special interests from trade competition, and the promotion of companies with their headquarters in their home country as national champions. All of these can have positive effects in moderation, but the current trend is likely to go too far without the restraint that comes when the United States enforces the rules. Even under the Obama administration, the United States was slow to put new issues, such as women’s empowerment, refugee resettlement, Internet privacy, and environmental concerns, on the international agenda. Yet the best way to deal with these issues would be to bring other countries’ concerns about the United States’ errors to a discussion at the G-20. For other countries to give up on U.S. leadership, let alone for the United States itself to abandon the system, would only worsen these problems.

The most immediate response to the Trump administration’s retreat has come on trade. The prospect of the United States’ withdrawal from the global trading system has spurred several large economies to conclude bilateral or regional trade agreements. In the past year, the EU has all but concluded substantive trade deals with Canada, Japan, Singapore, and Vietnam, and it has accelerated negotiations with Mexico and the South American trading bloc Mercosur. With surprising speed, the 11 nations remaining in the Trans-Pacific Partnership after the United States withdrew in early 2017 have moved forward with much of the agreement, with Australia and Japan taking the lead. Regional trade talks in Asia and Africa involving China and negotiations among Latin American countries have also gained pace; although these types of negotiations tend to result in lower-quality agreements that would allow only limited liberalization and resolve few regulatory issues, they will divert trade from elsewhere, including the United States.

The Trump administration has begun attacking international institutions from NATO to the UN. By blocking the appointment of new trade-dispute judges to sit on the WTO’s seven-member appellate body, the administration is preventing the WTO from functioning normally. Here, the rest of the world has been slower to respond. A few world leaders, such as Argentine President Mauricio Macri, who defended the WTO at the organization’s biennial meeting in December, have spoken out. Canada has filed a WTO case against the many unilateral trade measures the Trump administration is pursuing, which may set a precedent for action by other countries. But most have remained silent, possibly because they do not wish to provoke Trump into directly withdrawing from or further attacking the organization.

Some nontrade aspects of the liberal rules-based order can continue to function in the absence of U.S. leadership. Most institutions and forums will not work as well, or as consistently, or as adaptably, but they will persist. The systems that allow international financial cooperation have been largely spared from attack so far, in part because of the Federal Reserve’s legal independence. Yet without U.S. leadership, even these regimes will be vulnerable to future economic shocks. In the event of a major downturn, large countries will likely fail to act together if the United States does not contribute. The system is not designed to withstand a full-on assault by Washington. If Trump wants to tear down the order, it will be difficult for other countries to limit the damage.

BEGGAR-THY-NEIGHBOR

Left-wing critics of the U.S.-led liberal economic order often argue that the system encourages countries to race to the bottom, exploiting poorer populations along the way. This criticism has particular merit when it comes to environmental protections and labor rights, areas in which the United States does not do enough domestically and so lowers global standards. But until recently, a combination of peer pressure and formal agreements encouraged by the United States had increasingly limited the extent to which countries undercut one another. Over the last decade, international efforts, led in part by the Obama administration working through the G-20, had begun to rein in two of the most pernicious beggar-thy-neighbor policies, currency manipulation and the creation of tax havens.

If the U.S. government walks away from its leadership role, this picture will change dramatically. Today, tax competition largely takes the form of constructive pressure to bring rates and coverage somewhat in line with those of comparable economies. The United States, along with some other countries, is disadvantaged under the current system, but only international cooperation has a hope of plugging the holes rather than just driving every country’s revenues down. If the United States tries unilaterally to use its tax code to attract corporate headquarters away from other countries, the incentives to race to the bottom by allowing tax evasion will strengthen. The tax bill signed by Trump in December has many complex provisions, but overall, it appears to privilege domestic production in a way likely to both reduce economic efficiency and promote tax conflict internationally.

More broadly, either opportunistic multinational companies will pit countries against one another as governments compete to attract jobs or countries will designate national champions that will demand protection and subsidies. Either way, companies’ shareholders will capture more of national incomes, shifting resources away from individual taxpayers and workers and shrinking governments’ abilities to deal with social issues and invest in long-term projects. Beggar-thy-neighbor policies will beggar everyone.

Another goal of the postwar liberal order was to give the governments of developing countries a voice. Global governance has never been truly equal; the United States and other major countries have always played a dominant role. And deadlock often stymies institutions in which all member countries have an equal vote, such as at the WTO. But the IMF, the World Bank, and other multilateral development institutions have generally applied consistent criteria across countries when apportioning lending and aid, authorized by their collective membership.

In contrast, in a world in which national security links and bilateral relationships displace general rules and multilateral institutions, aid and crisis financing will grow increasingly politicized. Whether a developing country gets access to financing might come to depend on whether it sits inside a major country’s sphere of influence and is willing to accept (or unable to resist) political domination by that country. The IMF and the World Bank will remain, but without backing from rich countries, they will likely not be able to counterbalance this kind of politicization in large parts of the world.

To avoid facing such political pressures, many emerging-market countries will make renewed attempts to hedge against situations in which they need assistance by keeping larger currency reserves, even if that comes at the cost of domestic investment. They will also try to secure patrons who will promise them relatively unconditional assistance when it is needed. With those promises in hand, countries will have less need of help from international institutions and thus will be more willing to keep international monitors out of their decisions. This combination will make financial crises more frequent and, by interfering with international cleanup efforts, more likely to do lasting political and economic damage. The division between middle-income countries and countries that remain poor will grow even starker as inconsistencies in the system will hurt the poorest and smallest countries the most.

THE POST-REALITY ECONOMY

Less obvious but no less destructive effects of the U.S. withdrawal from economic leadership will come on the macroeconomic side. These have begun with recent efforts to compromise economic statistics. The United States has always taken pride in the fact that it relies on independent agencies to report data about its economy. That has allowed it to press other countries to disclose information properly and promptly, given rise to a set of definitions and techniques to help them do so, and created the basis for formal agreements on economic surveillance among technocrats. Objective, standardized economic data allow policymakers to adjust their policies based on more than gut feelings or salesmanship. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the IMF, with strong support from the United States, help develop and maintain this statistical regime; their regular reports on member countries’ policies and performance give voters and investors independent expert assessments to consider.

Yet over the past year, British and U.S. politicians have begun to disparage their own technocrats’ findings. In London, government ministers have dismissed official agencies’ skeptical analyses of Brexit, and in Washington, Republican members of Congress have rejected legally required assessments of legislation by the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation. In some cases, they have even attempted to prevent analyses and data from being released to the public. Politicians will always present numbers in a rosy light and push back against criticism, often with some justification. But when they demand loyalty over objectivity and suppress findings they do not like, they legitimate tactics that were once the preserve of autocrats. Other self-interested politicians will follow this lead. It is impossible to put a number on the damage this could do by allowing wrong-headed policies, distorting and deterring investment by raising uncertainty, and reducing the ability of publics to hold their governments accountable.

As the United States turns away from the liberal rules-based order and economic decisions grow more intertwined with political power, uncertainty will rise and returns on investment will fall. Governments will work to trap investment at home, either to create domestic jobs or to fund a corrupt political system. Those efforts will always come at an economic cost. If they did not, governments would not have to prevent money from flowing abroad. Policies that restrict foreigners’ ability to invest in a particular country are more of a mixed bag. Limits on some kinds of foreign investment can help prevent destabilizing surges of capital into and out of economies. But such policies can easily go too far since foreign direct investment brings a wide range of benefits for advanced and developing economies alike.

If governments begin to restrict capital flows, investors will find it harder to diversify their investments across the global economy. That will expose households and businesses to greater losses from volatility within their particular country or region. Laws that make it more difficult for households to get their savings into or out of an economy will reduce the level of investment and shift it toward more liquid assets, such as cash and government bonds. Worthwhile business ventures will struggle to raise capital.

Wealthy but aging societies in Europe, North America, and Northeast Asia need to invest in growing emerging-market countries to sustain their retirement incomes. Emerging economies need investment from wealthier countries to build roads, bridges, and hospitals; develop Internet and other communications networks; and train doctors, teachers, and other professionals. But if politicians and national security threats interfere with investment between countries or among different sectors of the economy, that win-win exchange will become more tenuous, leaving both retirees and workers around the world worse off.

TRADE ON

The international free-trade regime forms the most visible—and the most reviled—aspect of the postwar economic order. But it is here that U.S. withdrawal might actually do the least harm. The United States is more dispensable to the rules-based trading regime than it is in other economic spheres, and the other major trading countries are responding to U.S. withdrawal by deepening their own trade agreements. International trade has persisted throughout recorded human history, even when some global economies have left the system (as China did from the mid-fifteenth century to the mid-eighteenth century, Japan did from the mid-seventeenth century to the mid-nineteenth century, and the Soviet Union did throughout its existence). Trade can be limited, but never completely squelched.

U.S. withdrawal will still hurt. Countries have already begun to shift their trade flows, supply chains, and business relations away from the U.S. market. This process will only accelerate as the United States retreats. Although the U.S. economy’s sheer size will make it impossible for other countries to completely divert trade around it, that size will also worsen the global economic losses from the United States’ withdrawal.

If the United States entirely abandons the global free-trade system, the result will be a massive reduction in the size of global markets. That would leave consumers with less variety and worse quality in the products they buy, leave companies less able to take advantage of economies of scale, and leave countries more likely to diverge from the common technologies and standards that make modern life possible. Global competition would wither. The United States itself would suffer as companies pursued opportunities in places where new trade deals expanded markets and the politics were more favorable. Among the biggest losers would be Americans themselves, as they would soon pay more than they do now for almost everything and miss out on the new jobs and growth that would otherwise have come from the rise of developing economies.

It is on trade that U.S. withdrawal might actually do the least harm.

As the leader of the global economic order, the United States has, albeit insufficiently, pushed to enshrine tougher standards for anticorruption, environmental protection, and human rights in major trade deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. There is still room for improvement, but trade deals without the United States, especially those that include China but not the EU, will likely score far worse on all these counts. Even the EU may compromise more readily than before when it becomes the leading high-income economy in the global trading system. Without the United States to counterbalance it, Brussels will be tempted to sell out its values for economic gain. It may restrict the spread of biotechnologies and agricultural innovations, as many EU countries have an anti-science opposition to them; attempt to split up the Internet in order to advantage European companies in search, shopping, and social networking; and acquiesce to demands from Beijing to transfer militarily useful technology or recognize its territorial claims in return for preferential access to Chinese markets. The United States has sometimes failed to stand on principle on these matters, but U.S. leadership with European support remains the only way to make any progress on such issues. Otherwise, the incentives for each major economy will be to pander and compromise.

THE HOUSE THAT WE BUILT

The United States has at times failed to live up to its ideals as the leader of the liberal economic system. That failure has grown more frequent since 9/11, as many Americans have felt threatened by the growth of terrorism and the economic rise of China. That trend also reflects a recurrent nativism in the U.S. electorate and Congress that predates—and contributed to—Trump’s election. The United States has played too dominant a role in some areas of global economic discussion and been reluctant to allow other countries to help set the agenda, partly in an effort to pander to domestic nationalists by maintaining the symbolism of dominance. But far worse than a lackluster leader is one that abandons its role altogether or even works actively to subvert the system’s values. A return to bullying would only harm economic growth.

The United States’ motivation for building the postwar economic system was as much preventing conflict as promoting growth. In setting out the rules by which all members would conduct business, the architects of the system hoped to separate economic from military competition. U.S. withdrawal need not result in economic or physical wars, but it will raise the risk of stumbling into conflict by accident. Without agreed-on rules, even minor economic disputes have the potential to set off escalating counterattacks. If the norm of separation between economic and military confrontations breaks down, economic frictions, such as Chinese theft of intellectual property or restrictions on trade with a nuclear Iran or North Korea, could turn into outright conflict.

It is plausible that as the United States retreats and thereby weakens its economy, the Trump administration will blame the economic damage not on its own actions but on foreign governments, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of anger. When other major countries step forward to preserve the open economic order, or defend themselves against U.S. economic aggression, Washington may interpret that as an attack on U.S. primacy. The Trump administration might even misinterpret the current forbearance by China or the EU as a sign of weakness and an invitation to escalate confrontations.

Today, a smaller share of the world’s population than ever lives in poverty, and a larger share than ever lives a middle-class existence. This is not solely the result of China’s astonishing rise. In Chile, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Vietnam, and the countries of the former Soviet Union, economic growth has brought hundreds of millions of people out of what amounted to subsistence or little better. This miracle took place without conquest or even much conflict, and with greater protections for private property and human rights than ever before. The liberal order constructed and led by the United States made such progress possible by giving countries, businesses, and individuals the opportunity to build their economic lives without fear of a foreign power taking away what they had made. That U.S. leadership has not, as some have charged, hurt the United States. The country’s rampant inequality and wage stagnation are largely the result of domestic political choices and failures. A world in which the United States ceases to lead—or, worse still, attacks—the system it built will be poorer, nastier, less fair, and more dangerous for everyone.","(0, 'GDP')"

I mean, I’m glad it’s continued, but when you hear about this economic miracle that’s been going on, when the job numbers come out, monthly job numbers, suddenly Republicans are saying it’s a miracle. I have to kind of remind them, actually, those job numbers are the same as they were in 2015 and 2016.”

— Former president Barack Obama, in remarks at the University of Illinois, on Sept. 7, 2018

There’s little doubt that the economy is doing well. Regular readers of The Fact Checker know we automatically award Two Pinocchios to anyone who gives sole credit to a president for economic improvements. That’s because the U.S. economy is complex, and the decisions of companies and consumers often loom larger than the acts of government.

That hasn’t stopped President Trump from trying to take credit. He called the economy a disaster during the campaign. Now, he brags about the low unemployment rate, the positive jobs reports, the booming stock market and growth in the gross domestic product. He often attributes the good numbers to the tax bill he pushed through Congress, his deregulatory agenda and growing business confidence under his tenure.

Trump claims that every time he meets a foreign leader, they congratulate him on “the incredible job [he’s] done with the United States economy.” He claimed he’s created the “best economy in U.S. history” nearly 50 times in three months, earning Three Pinocchios in the process.

This boasting has apparently begun to annoy Obama, who argues that Trump is simply surfing off the economy that emerged after the Great Recession — which was going on when Obama took the oath of office.

The White House did not respond to a specific question about Trump’s assertion of an economic turnaround, but an official did provide data making the case that Trump exceeded expectations for the economy at the time of Obama’s departure.

We’ve previously compared U.S. economic performance under Obama and under Trump during Trump’s first year in office. But overseeing a strong economy is not the same as accomplishing a “turnaround.” Can Trump take credit? Or did today’s trends start before he took office?

The Facts

There isn’t one factor alone that makes an economy “good” or “bad.” A thriving economy is felt (or not felt) in a multitude of ways. Let’s examine a variety of measures looking at where the economy was when Obama took office, when Trump took office and where it is now.

Jobs

Trump regularly (and incorrectly) brags he’s added 4 million jobs since taking office. Regular readers may remember we gave the president Two Pinocchios for claiming that he created 1 million jobs about six months into his term.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. economy added 2,188,000 jobs in 2017 — Trump’s first year in office. So far, it has added 1,306,000 jobs in 2018. But the economy added more jobs in every year of Obama’s second term than it did in Trump’s first year. This holds true when examining the average number of jobs added per month. (We are counting average monthly jobs created from February to January because the January data is collected the week of Jan. 12, before a president takes the oath of office on Jan. 20.)

The monthly numbers suggest Trump is continuing an existing trend. But a White House official argues this is unfair because the nation is at full employment. Before Trump’s election, the official noted, the Congressional Budget Office at the start of 2017 predicted job growth of about 160,000 per month in the first half of 2017, 116,000 per month in the second half of 2017 and 94,000 jobs per month in 2018. So Trump is doing much better than CBO’s 2017 estimates.

Unemployment rate

The unemployment rate is the best it has been in a decade, holding steady at 3.9 percent in August. Shortly after Trump took office in February 2017, the unemployment rate was 4.7 percent. It has declined at a faster pace than the Congressional Budget Office predicted at the beginning of Trump’s term, but the unemployment rate had already stabilized. It was ranging between 4.6 and 5 percent starting in August 2015. That represents over a five-point decline since unemployment peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, nine months after Obama took office.

During the campaign, Trump argued that this measure was “totally fiction;” this argument earned him Four Pinocchios. He often pointed to people who had given up looking for work to back up his claim. Looking at another variation of the unemployment rate, the U6 number, which takes this into account, unemployment was 7.4 percent in August, down from 9.2 percent when Trump took office. Still, that’s a far cry from its peak — 17.1 percent in October 2009.

Employment in population (ages 25-54)

Advertisement

Another indicator of economic growth is the percentage of people employed during their prime working years. In December 2009, right before the end of Obama’s first year in office, 74.8 percent of adults between 25 and 54 were employed. The years 2010 and 2011 marked the indicator’s low points, averaging 75.1 percent each year. But by the time Obama left office, that yearly average had rebounded to 77.9 percent. The ratio continued to climb through 2017, averaging 78.6 percent for the year, and 2018 is on track to be the best year in a decade.

Stock market

During the 2016 campaign, Trump said the stock market was “in a big, fat bubble.” (Stocks have been rising steadily since March 2009.) But once he took office, he was first to point out any record-setting days. As we’ve previously noted, Trump regularly cites data from the Dow Jones industrial average, a collection of 30 U.S. “blue chip” companies. But the Standards & Poor’s 500 stock index provides a more nuanced data set. Comparing the S&Ps performance with similar markets since just before Trump took office, the S&P 500 (represented by the dark blue line) narrowly edged out Japan’s Nikkei 225 index (represented by the purple line) for the largest percentage of overall growth, while the German and British markets declined (light blue and pink lines, respectively). As of midyear, the Japanese and German markets had kept pace with the United States, but in recent months, the U.S. stock market has posted gains that have put it ahead.

GDP growth

Over the course of Obama’s first year in office, GDP dropped 2.5 percent. In 2010, GDP growth recovered, surging 2.5 percent. Growth was already positive when Trump took office, jumping from 1.6 percent in 2016 to 2.2 percent in 2017. Trump might point us to quarterly GDP growth. The economy is estimated to have gained 4.2 percent in the second quarter of 2018, but that still pales in comparison with the 5.1 percent and 4.9 percent growth in the second and third quarters of 2014 under Obama.

Still, Trump has beaten the expectations set by the Obama administration, which at the start of 2017 predicted growth of 2.4 percent in 2017 (fourth quarter to fourth quarter) and 2.3 percent in 2018. The big difference is Trump’s tax cuts and the huge spending bill he signed, which economists estimate added almost 1 percent in short-term GDP growth. Most forecasters did not raise long-run growth projection after passage of the tax cut; falling unemployment rates make it even more difficult to sustain economic growth at the current level.

Another measure of an economy’s health is the deficit-to-GDP ratio. In other words, how much a country is earning vs. how much it is spending. The measure ballooned to 9.8 percent in 2009 when the recession was at its peak and the stimulus act was passed. By 2016, it had gone down to 3.1 percent. In Trump’s first year, it went up to 3.4 percent. That’s unusual, because the economy is doing well, but it reflects the impact of Trump’s tax cut on government revenue. The increase in the federal deficit may make it hard for the government to respond to the next economic crisis. So if Trump is taking credit for the impact of the tax cut on economic growth, he needs to accept blame for the boost in the deficit.

Wages

Wage growth is one of those instances where just because Trump repeats a statistic a lot doesn’t make it accurate. Regular readers may remember Trump earning Four Pinocchios for his claim that “wages are now, for the first time in many years, rising.”

Seven months after that fact check, our conclusion is largely the same. Real median wages for all workers have been steadily increasing since 2014. In the last quarter of 2017, they plunged below their rate when Trump took office but have since recovered to about the same level. In other words, after an initial bump, wages are basically where Obama left them.

Poverty

The poverty rate isn’t something that Trump claims as a turnaround — or talks much about. A recent report from the U.S. Census Bureau shows the official poverty rate dropped 0.4 percentage points in 2017 to 12.3 percent. This marks the third consecutive annual decline, having fallen 2.5 points since 2014. Again, the trend that formed during Obama’s last years continued through Trump’s first.

And, as we’ve noted before, scholars increasingly believe that the official poverty estimate is a bit misleading and not especially informative. This is in large part because transfer payments — like the Earned Income Tax Credit or food stamps — are not recorded as income, so their impact isn’t incorporated into the official figure. To assuage these concerns, the Census Bureau introduced a second poverty measure in 2011 — the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM). (This also has critics.) The SPM is declining at a slower rate than the official poverty rate, dropping 2.2 points since its peak.

Trump has, however, started to brag about the number of people coming off food stamps, as shorthand for people getting back to work and out of poverty. But experts say the decline isn’t entirely due to better economic times. Many states have rolled back waivers that relaxed work requirements during the recession and allowed people to collect benefits for longer periods of time. There have also been reports that undocumented immigrants with children who are American citizens have stopped applying for federal assistance for fear of Trump’s immigration policies.

Business investment

Business investment plunged to a low in the fourth quarter of 2015, but it rebounded to 2010 levels by the time Trump took office. It has continued to climb — gaining 2.6 percentage points, but that tracks with the upward momentum that started at the end of Obama’s term. In 2017, however, the pickup was entirely in the oil and gas sector and related to rising oil prices — just as the slow investment growth in 2015 and 2016 was just in oil/gas and related to low oil prices. In 2018, the pickup has been more widespread. As with stock prices, business investment has spiked around the world.

The Pinocchio Test

Many of the eight factors we examined tell a common story — the start of Trump’s economy follows the trend set by the last years of Obama’s economy. We’ll keep an eye out as the president’s policy changes — from tariffs to taxes — settle into the U.S. and global markets, but as of now, Trump is still working off the base Obama built.

We’ve said before that anyone who gives sole credit to a president for economic gains receives an automatic Two Pinocchios — and Trump’s claim of a historic turnaround is worthy of more. The historical books are going to view the actions taken in 2008 and 2009 by George W. Bush and Obama — and the Federal Reserve — as pivotal to saving the U.S. economy.

Trump, however, has exceeded expectations on jobs and economic growth that were in place at the start of 2017. That’s due in part because of his tax cut, but also because of factors largely beyond his control, such as the increase in oil prices. The real test will be whether the current trajectory is sustainable.

That was particularly the case in tabloids in New York, where Trump struggled to climb out from beneath some tough headlines that undermined his carefully crafted master-businessman brand.

Since then, Trump has revisited a theme when talking about economic crashes: emphasizing the opportunity in them.

As he has entered the political realm and now presides over an uncertain economy that could make or break his 2020 reelection, he has also talked about the political utility — and even the necessity — of recessions and crashes.

Trump’s most infamous comment on this came before he launched his 2016 campaign. During one of his frequent appearances on “Fox and Friends” in 2014, he talked with the hosts about how Democrats have a political advantage in offering people government benefits, even if those things might hurt the country’s economy.

“You know what solves it?” he said. “When the economy crashes, when the country goes to total hell and everything is a disaster, then you’ll have riots to go back to where we used to be when we were great.”

But that’s hardly the only time he has talked about how downturns can be turned into an advantage. Here’s a recap.

1992: “I used to say — and in fact I think I said in my first book, and maybe this was foolish, but I really meant it — that someday I’d like to maybe lose everything for a period of time to see who’s loyal and who’s not loyal.” (Interview with Charlie Rose)

1999: While considering a Reform Party candidacy for president in 2000:

GERALDO RIVERA: Are we headed for a crash? Are we headed — do you hear the bears galloping across Central Park? TRUMP: Well, I hope not, and I think not, but I will say this: The Reform Party nominee will have a lot better chance if there is a crash, and it could — you know, something pretty catastrophic could happen. I don’t think so. I hope it’s going to go on. ... I’m actually rooting for a great economy. I have to tell you. if I have my choice — you mean, do I get more votes? I’d like to see the economy stay. Too many people get hurt the other way.

1999: “If the economy is bad at the time of the election — and you know, we have a long way to go, and lots of things can happen — the Reform Party candidate would, if it’s the right candidate, have a good chance.” (Matt Lauer interview)

2004: While discussing the construction of Trump Place: “To be honest, the near collapse of New York during the 1990s is what got it done. If New York had been doing well, we would never have gotten the zoning for that job. It’s always good to get zoning in bad times and build in good times.” (Playboy interview)

2004: “I don’t want to blame the real estate markets, because I always made a lot of money in bad markets. I love bad markets. You can do very well in a bad market.” (CNN interview)

2006: On predictions that the housing market was headed for a crash: “I sort of hope that happens, because then people like me would go in and buy. … If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know you can make a lot of money. If you’re in a good cash position — which I’m in a good cash position today — then people like me would go in and buy like crazy.” (Trump University audiobook “How to Build a Fortune”)

2007: “We’re talking very minor [problems] compared with the depression of the early 1990s. … People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I’m excited if it is. I’ve always made more money in bad markets than in good markets.” (Globe and Mail interview)

2013: “One good aspect of the Obama depression is that it will separate the winners from the losers. If you can make it now, you deserve it!” (Twitter)

One good aspect of the Obama depression is that it will separate the winners from the losers. If you can make it now, you deserve it! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 28, 2013

2014: “When the economy crashes, when the country goes to total hell and everything is a disaster, then you’ll have riots to go back to where we used to be when we were great.” (“Fox and Friends” interview)

April 2016: “You know a really good businessman, when the economy crashes and you’re in the middle of a big job, maybe it’s a building or a deal or a factory or something, right — the really good ones are the ones that can take a catastrophe and make it good. I’ve taken some deals that should be terrible and made 'em better than if the economy stayed strong. And the reason you lose it is sometimes the economy, and you know, who’s going to be blamed for the economy? The politicians, maybe. But the really good ones are the ones that can take a bad condition, and you go in and you beat up the banks.” (Campaign rally in Pittsburgh)

May 2016: On renegotiating debt: “And you know debt was always sort of interesting to me. Now we’re in a different situation with a country, but I would borrow knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal. And if the economy was good, it was good, so therefore you can’t lose.” (CNBC interview)

As president, Trump has understandably less interest in a downturn — given its implication for his reelection — but even he has suggested that it might be necessary for achieving larger goals. See his comments last month about his trade war with China:","(2, 'housing')"

Is it about economic angst among the white working class, or is it primarily a cultural backlash?

Writers like the Atlantic’s Michelle Cottle worried that “Trumpism has, in part, made the rest of the nation all the more eager to ignore the millions of white voters living on the edges of the economy.”

But as my Vox colleague Dylan Matthews noted, “there is absolutely no evidence that Trump’s supporters, either in the primary or the general election, are disproportionately poor or working class.” The median household income for Trump voters, as reported by FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver, was $72,000, roughly $10,000 higher than the median household income of non-Hispanic whites.

Pippa Norris is a comparative political scientist at Harvard University, and one of the leading authorities on populism. She’s also the co-author of a recent study on the rising support for populist parties in Western societies. Her paper examined the dueling theories about the causes of the populist surge and found that the cultural backlash explanation was the stronger of the two.

In this interview, I chat with Norris about her findings. Our conversation, edited for clarity and length, covers a lot of ground — from the distinctions between left and right-wing populism to the post-war cultural shifts that paved the way for populist candidates to the unique vulnerabilities of liberal democracies. We also discuss whether the cultural backlash in Europe and the United States represents a failure of multiculturalism as such.

Sean Illing

The term “populism” has become a vague catchall. What does it actually mean?

Pippa Norris

Populism for me has three dimensions. One of which is an appeal to popular sovereignty over and above liberal democracy. So the argument is that moral virtue and power should be with the ordinary people and not the elites.

The second dimension is anti-establishment, and this is opposed not just to political and economic elites but also to other perceived power-holders, like intellectuals or journalists or other groups at the top of society.

And then thirdly, even though it's about popular sovereignty in practice, there aren't that many mechanisms. Mechanisms like public opinion polls or other forms of democratic referendum are typically weak. So in practice, what happens is the power is seen to reside in the individual leader, the charismatic leader who represents the voice of the ordinary people.

So those three elements come together but they don't tell you a lot about what populists stand for. And here what you get is a variety of populists — from authoritarian populists to progressive populists, and they differ in their actual values.

So you can think of populism as a way to critique liberal democracy, which opens the door for a variety of leaders who have different ideologies, whether we're talking Hugo Chavez in Venezuela or Donald Trump in America.

Sean Illing

Does “authoritarian populism” and “progressive populism” mean right-wing populism and left-wing populism?

Pippa Norris

No, that’s not quite right. I use the terms left-wing and right-wing much more economically, and it has to do with where people are in state versus welfare, where people are in markets versus redistribution.

Authoritarianism is actually a different dimension. Authoritarian values are those which uphold belief in a strong leader, in a strong state, and in robust law and order. These are traditional values like the family, home, religion, and then a variety of other values like nativism, the importance of national unity, the national community versus outsiders, whether defined by nationality or ethnicity or race.

I think we tend to use the terms “left” and “right” in a sloppy fashion, because it's the familiar way that we classify parties in the post-war era in Europe where you see the difference, for example, between social democrats and communists versus conservatives and liberals.

What we've got now is a new cultural cleavage which overlays that, and populists therefore can be left-wing or right-wing or in the middle. Basically they're very vague on economics, but it's the cultural values which are the critical aspects which differ for them.

Sean Illing

How do you distinguish Donald Trump from Bernie Sanders, both of whom seem to fall under the populist umbrella?

Pippa Norris

Well, this is why we have varieties of populism. Populism authoritarians — like Trump — open the door because they reduce the checks and balances in liberal democracy, but then they try to push through a range of traditional authoritarian values. Populist progressives, like Sanders, employ similar rhetoric but they work out of a progressive agenda, not just in taxation like in Chavez in Venezuela, but also on other economic issues as well.

So you've got these basic cleavages, and you can classify European parties along the same line. In Spain, for example, you have Podemos, which is populist progressive. They're on the left in terms of economic issues. They're progressive in terms of social issues, but they want a critique of the establishment power and the elites.

Similarly, the Five Star Movement in Rome is definitely progressive although approaching more authoritarian. Then you have others in Greece, Finland, Sweden and elsewhere which also tilt authoritarian.

So populists have a particular approach to politics, but what they support depends on where they are on the cultural cleavage.

Sean Illing

This is part of the reason why it’s so difficult to talk about populism in an analytically precise way. It really transcends our traditional ideological categories.

Pippa Norris

It transcends the 1950s classification that we're so used to. The post-war era is one in which people are very much divided between those who believed in economic redistribution, a strong welfare state, and a role for Keynesian economic management versus those who believed in markets and hands off, low taxation and more classical liberalism in the economy.

This dimension has closed over the years. It's closed particularly in Europe, as many parties move toward the center, becoming catchall parties. What has emerged is a new dimension, and it started again in the ’60s and ’70s with the Green parties, which became more progressive and affirmed a different set of values toward cosmopolitanism and the environmentalism.

Then we saw, as a reaction against this new progressivism, the growth of those who believe in nationalism and authoritarianism. These parties, especially across Europe, have grown in strength in more recent periods even though in most countries they remain a minority.

Sean Illing

So, in many ways, we’ve got a new left and a new right struggling to absorb a different constellation of political values.

Pippa Norris

That’s right. The old distinctions don’t quite fit any longer. Conservatives have sought to adopt some of these new values, particularly the aggressive nationalism, but they pay a price for that. It’s very difficult for the old left to know how to adopt these values because they're on the progressive side and they don't know how to respond and hold on to their core beliefs about tolerance and cosmopolitanism.

Sean Illing

Populism isn’t tied to any particular ideological project, but do you consider a populist a demagogue by definition?

Pippa Norris

You can have authoritarian demagogues who aren’t populists and you can have populists who aren’t demagogues. But clearly it's often closely related. So some people argue that populism is a style and a language which appeals very much to ordinary people; it's short discourse and very straight language. It's often transgressive discourse, which uses language that is seen as unacceptable by traditional politicians, and that's an appeal again that the leader is part of the everyman.

Populists, and this is key, make a very deliberate effort to show that they’re of the common people. They’re not pointy-headed elites or cultural sophisticates. There are many demagogues who are populists and populists who are demagogues, but the two things are obviously separate. You can get demagogues who have other basic ways of expressing themselves.

Sean Illing

The transgressive part seems to me important. Populism, whatever else it is, is about disruption, about shattering the status quo.

Pippa Norris

That's right. In a liberal democracy, it's about shattering the established parties, the established cooperations and the established intellectual forms of power and hegemony. In some other countries, of course, you can see this is more democratic but it depends very much on the regime which is in power.

So if you think of revolutionary radical Muslims seeking to out some of the traditional leaders in authoritarian regimes, they're often populists but with a very different set of values behind them.

So populism is rather an empty shell when it comes to what its positives are, but it is always clear what it is against: established power.

Sean Illing

I want to return to what you said earlier about the cultural roots of modern populism. In one of your recent papers, you tell a familiar but troubling story: Since at least the 1970s, Western societies have emphasized what you call “post-materialist” and “self-expression” values among the young educated strata of society. This has produced movements toward greater gender and racial equality, equal rights for LGBTQ people, more acceptance of diverse lifestyles and cultures, etc. It’s also resulted in less focus on redistributionist economics.

You argue that we’ve reached something of a tipping point culturally as less educated and older citizens, particularly white men, are now increasingly resentful of a society that no longer privileges them or their values.

Pippa Norris

The idea that values are being changed has long roots going back to the 1970s, but it has new traction, if you like. The argument is that you adopt the values at the time that you grew up and it’s part of your societal conditioning. Look, for example, at the actual groups who were growing up in Europe when there was a welfare state from cradle to grave. The arguments were about meeting basic material needs — full employment, free education, free health care, etc.

In many of these countries, values changed from a focus on material needs — jobs, economic growth, and the things people who lived through the Great Recession and the period of war cared about — to a different set of values, which was environmental, gender equality, participation, democracy and a whole range of other post-material values. This is a long-term change which my co-author, Ron Inglehart, has predicted for many decades.

What we think happened is that there's been a tipping point in terms of where majority values have become the new minority. So it's really about population change more than anything else. If a generation grows up with certain values, those values gradually take over that culture. We can see the manifestation in many policies.

Think, for example, of gay marriage and the way in which marriage rights were something that was not even discussed 20 years ago or even 10 years ago. They weren't mainstream in the political agenda. And now many, many countries have equalized gay marriage, although affluent countries are still going through that process. Similarly, tolerance of homosexuality, ideas that women should have equal values, secular values as well, the idea that religion is no longer central to people's lives. So those are values which are shifting.

Those people that are benefiting from these shifts take them for granted as they grow in their status and their power, but there's been a tipping point when those groups and the values around them are no longer being reflected and, what's more, they can't even talk about them.

Sean Illing

Hence the political correctness battles are really just another front in the broader culture war.

Pippa Norris

Right. Political correctness is really about the belief that people’s values are being suppressed and that they're no longer respected. They no longer have status. So there’s a group, rightly or wrongly, justly or unjustly, that feels left out.

They tend to be concentrated amongst the older generation, not inevitably but broadly. They tend to be concentrated around the less educated who haven't benefited from college and the changes that brings. And they also tend to be men more than women, whites more than minorities.

Those groups have gone into a kind of minority cultural status, and I think this is the best way to make sense of their reactionary posture.

Sean Illing

Broadly speaking, I think you’re right, though a lot of this, in my view, is just rank hysteria ginned up by xenophobic opportunists. But what you’re describing seems to capture what happened in our most recent election.

Pippa Norris

Trump supporters suddenly got liberated and they felt free to express all of these latent resentments. With Trump, they could express these feelings loudly, and of course Trump himself said these things in a transgressive way. At the same time, those groups that have been benefitting but haven't been voting, like younger people, suddenly felt like their values were under threat and these values are also things which express themselves and then get turned into politics through the ballot box.

Sean Illing

And here we have a recipe for our current dilemma: Older people represent a cultural minority but they vote more than any other group, which is how we end up with a president who is disliked by a majority of Americans but still managed to win the election.

Pippa Norris

Old people vote, young people protest, and those trends mean that older people's values have become disproportionally represented through the political system, and parties and younger people are now out there on the street every day in their pink hats because they feel that their values are under threat.

Basically they think that the America they were complacent about, that was changing, is no longer necessarily representing their views.

Sean Illing

As you know, there are dueling theses about what's really behind the Trump phenomenon: It’s either about economic insecurity or it’s a cultural backlash among older, whiter Americans. You seem firmly in the latter camp.

Pippa Norris

That's right, and the solutions are very different depending on how you interpret what happened. If it's economics, you can go along with the Bernie Sanders solution. You can think of job apprenticeships, such as we've had in Germany, to make sure that blue-collar workers have the skills they need, building up community colleges, improving the minimum wage. You can think about economic redistribution. Parties like Labour under Jeremy Corbyn have certainly adopted those policies in a way to try to get back to the electorate and build up their support, but it basically hasn't worked.

On the other hand, if it's cultural factors, then there's a much deeper problem. It's a problem for liberals in particular. Many of the leaders and members of parties who are active on the left are actually part of the progressive left. They’re well-educated and won't go back on issues like gender equality or issues of race and racism or Islamophobia. So they’re limited in terms of how they can respond to this cultural backlash.

On some of the basic values which Trump's supporters and authoritarians believe, they're not going to reverse. They're not going to simply abandon all evidence-based policy, the emphasis on education and expanding college education or emphasis on gender equality, women's rights or social tolerance in the broadest sense for social diversity because that's built into their DNA.

So progressive forces leading social democratic parties can try to build their support back and they can do some things, but it's much easier for parties on the right to adopt some of the similar language.

Sean Illing

A few months ago, I spoke to another political scientist, Justin Gest of George Mason University, and he was making what seems to me a crucial point, one you’re making here, and that is that Trump voters aren’t opposed to the welfare state or entitlement programs. What they're opposed to is the idea that minorities or other “out” groups are receiving those benefits.

They’re wrong, of course, in believing that minorities are “taking” all of the benefits, but the perception is real nevertheless.

Pippa Norris

That's exactly right. This is welfare chauvinism. It’s about who should get the benefits. Think about Trump: He slashed all sorts of things like the arts, for all the people who go to the opera, or for people like myself, who like NPR. But he doesn't touch in any shape or form Social Security, because Social Security is for the older voters who are voting for him.

On other economic issues, other welfare issues, the budget slashing will have mixed effects on the poorest sections of society. But the perception among a lot of Trump supporters is that these outside groups have come in and “taken” benefits that they don’t deserve, and that therefore they should be penalized.

Sean Illing

Are we witnessing what amounts to a failure of multiculturalism, first in Europe and now in the United States?

Pippa Norris

No, we're actually witnessing the success of multiculturalism: It's taking over in the broader sense in the population and in society. I can give you lots and lots of trends on that. You can look at various polls and surveys measuring things like tolerance of minorities, cosmopolitanism, the attitudes toward the United Nations, toward NATO, toward the European Union, and you find that young people are incredibly cosmopolitan, incredibly multicultural. They see their lives as being one where you work in one country, you live in another, you end up in a third.

But, predictably, there is a reaction against multiculturalism, which is a sign that it has succeeded. Social changes have accelerated multiculturalism, and that is perceived as threatening to those opposed to it. There are immense pressures to adapt and adopt.

We have to think about how best to adapt to multiculturalism, but in terms of broad social attitudes, there's no evidence that, for example, attitudes toward homosexuality or gender or religion are in any way going in a more traditional direction.

Sean Illing

That makes plenty of sense, but this period of disruption could be far worse than anyone anticipated. If, as you seem to suggest, we will get more populism, does that mean we will get more constitutional crises in Western countries?

Pippa Norris

This is a difficult issue. You have to consider three factors when you talk about the impact of populism. You have the institutional rules of the game, things like the Electoral College. If we didn't have the Electoral College, then we'd have Hillary Clinton in the White House. There’s also how parties respond to each other, and that's what you might term the supply side of the equation. Then you also have the public demand, which is the value shifts and the cultural changes.

A lot depends on the type of system a country has. Different systems will respond in different ways to populist pressures. In most European systems, the party system is flexible. In the United Kingdom, for example, you have 13 parties sitting in Parliament. In Netherlands, Germany, and other countries, you've got a multi-party system. In a few countries like the United States, you've only got two parties. Now those parties themselves are umbrellas, so they're ideologically indistinct in certain regards, but it's also very difficult for other parties to break through.

Are there going to be populist parties in the future? Absolutely. They're not going to go away. How successful they are depends on the institutional rules and depends on how other parties respond to them in terms of either taking over their issues, ignoring them, or trying to isolate them in certain regards. But the American system is resistant to major shocks because of the strength of the two-party structure.

Sean Illing

I take your point that America’s two-party system creates high hurdles for outlier parties or movements, but I think this election made clear that institutional barriers won’t save us. It turns out that norms and customs are every bit as important, and those only exist to the extent that people in power respect them.

Pippa Norris

There was a paper written recently by two political scientists, Roberto Stefan Foa and Yascha Mounk. The New York Times actually reported on it. They argued that Western democracy was in danger because young people around the world don’t support democratic values. In a paper that will be coming out soon in The Journal of Democracy, I challenge this argument.

To say that Western democracies are under threat, there are three kind of factors you need to look out for, and this goes back to our theories of democratic consolidation from the early ’90s. Democracy is stable if, culturally, the overwhelming majority of people believe that democracy is the best form of government, meaning they adhere to the values. Secondly, constitutionally all the basic agencies and organizations of a state have to reflect those democratic norms. Thirdly, no significant groups actively seek to overthrow the regime.

I go through all the evidence and argue that there is some reduced support for democracy amongst young people, but it's mostly under Anglo-American democracies; it’s not universal. I also look for evidence that democracy is slipping at the institutional level across Western democracies. It turns out there is not much evidence for this, and indeed most of the trends go in a positive direction. Most of the slippage that has occurred has been in hybrid regimes in countries like Poland, Hungary, Venezuela, and Mexico, all of which have been under threat for some time.

The biggest threat comes from populism and terrorism. The two things go hand in hand and they feed on each other. They're mutually parasitic in some ways. So those two things together pose the greatest threat to Western democracy. But so far we can't say that they are destroying democracy because there has been pushback.

The ways in which the resistance has organized, the ways in which the courts have been asserted, the ways in which the media has been so critical of the Trump administration. All of our mainstream and legacy media — the New York Times, Vox, the Guardian, the BBC, and many more — are behaving the way they are supposed to behave in resistance to an authoritarian presidency.

So it’s not time to panic yet?

Pippa Norris

That’s right. It’s not yet Chicken Little time. The courts have done what the courts should do. The media has done what it’s supposed to do. Civil society is still vibrant. The protests are amazing. Young people are energized. Opposition groups like the ACLU are seeing a tremendous spike in contributions.

But we haven’t yet been properly tested. The tests are not in the good times or safe times. The tests are when the major crises occur. There will be another crisis in the next four or eight years, another terror attack or some other emergency.

This will be the real test.","(0, 'GDP')"

In the months leading up to Election Day, a heated debate broke out among political commentators over the source of Donald Trump’s support. Was it driven primarily by economic anxiety, as the early conventional wisdom often argued, or more by racism and other cultural factors?

The debate has continued in the weeks since Trump’s win, and lately the anxiety skeptics seem to be gaining the upper hand. Numerous writers, including some on this website, have noted that obvious measures of economic struggle such as poverty and unemployment were poor predictors of Trump support; indeed, exit polls show that Hillary Clinton won handily among poorer Americans. And whereas in 2012 Mitt Romney won among voters who considered the economy their top issue, Trump lost such voters. Measures of racism and sexism, and markers of social status such as a college degree, did a much better job predicting whom voters would support.

Correctly assessing the forces that led to Trump’s victory is more than an academic exercise. It’s central to figuring out what happens next — what Trump’s supporters expect him to do, what Democratic counter-measures would be effective, what metrics we should use to gauge his success. But the recent debate has missed an important distinction: Economic anxiety is not the same thing as economic hardship. And the evidence suggests that anxiety did play a key role in Trump’s victory, though it was by no means the only factor.

What’s the difference between hardship and anxiety? Hardship, as I’m using it here, refers to a person’s present-day economic struggles: poverty, joblessness, falling wages, foreclosure, bankruptcy. Anxiety is all about what lies ahead — concerns about saving for retirement or college, worry of a potential layoff, fears that your children’s prospects aren’t as bright as your own were.

Economic hardship doesn’t explain Trump’s support. In fact, quite the opposite: Clinton easily won most low-income areas. But anxiety is a different story. Trump, as FiveThirtyEight contributor Jed Kolko noted immediately after the election, won most counties — and improved on Romney’s performance — where a large share of jobs are vulnerable to outsourcing or automation. And while there is no standard measure of economic anxiety, a wide range of other plausible proxies shows the same pattern. According to my own analysis of voting data, for example, the slower a county’s job growth has been since 2007, the more it shifted toward Trump. (The same is true looking back to 2000.) And of course Trump performed especially strongly among voters without a college degree — an important indicator of social status but also of economic prospects, given the shrinking share of jobs (and especially well-paying jobs) available to workers without a bachelor’s degree.

The role of economic anxiety becomes even clearer in the data once you control for race. Black and Hispanic Americans tend both to be poorer and to face worse economic prospects than non-Hispanic whites, but they also had strong non-economic reasons to vote against Trump, who had a history of making racist comments. Factoring in the strong opposition to Trump among most racial and ethnic minorities, Trump significantly outperformed Romney in counties where residents had lower credit scores and in counties where more men have stopped working.

The list goes on: More subprime loans? More Trump support. More residents receiving disability payments? More Trump support. Lower earnings among full-time workers? More Trump support. “Trump Country,” as my colleague Andrew Flowers described it shortly after the election, isn’t the part of America where people are in the worst financial shape; it’s the part of America where their economic prospects are on the steepest decline.

Teasing out cause and effect, of course, can be tricky, especially given that issues of race, economic status, education and social standing are so tightly linked in American society. But the economic anxiety explanation is consistent with what Trump supporters have been saying all along. More than a year ago, I visited Scott County, Iowa, where the unemployment rate was then 4.3 percent (it was an even lower 4.1 percent on Election Day). Nearly all the people I spoke to there were satisfied with their immediate economic situation. But when the conversation turned to the future, they were far more pessimistic.

“This is a county that 40 years ago, you could go to college and you’d be set for life, or you could come out of high school and get a job at Deere or Case or wherever and also be set for life with a solid, middle-class lifestyle,” Jason Gordon, a local alderman, told me at the time. “That doesn’t exist here anymore, and I don’t think it exists anywhere anymore.”

Scott County ended up voting for Clinton, but barely — she won by less than 2 percentage points. Obama won it by nearly 14 points four years earlier.

None of this is to say that economic issues are the only, or even the primary, explanation for Trump’s success. A recent paper from researchers at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, found that racism and sexism predicted support for Trump better than economic dissatisfaction. But even that paper found that economic dissatisfaction was an important factor. In other words, the “economics or culture” argument is a false dichotomy. There’s no reason that both forces couldn’t matter; in fact, both did.

This debate isn’t merely an academic curiosity. The role of economics in the election matters politically: for Trump, because voters may turn on him if he doesn’t deliver on his economic promises, and for Democrats, because they will struggle to win back the White House if they don’t find ways to speak convincingly on these issues. And it matters in terms of policy: Trump’s economic plans may not make much sense, but the problems identified by his supporters are real. Manufacturing jobs really have disappeared, and we haven’t yet found a source of similarly stable, well-paying jobs to take their place. Wages really have stagnated for much of the past 15 years, and economic mobility, at least by some definitions, really has fallen. College costs really have risen, and our retirement system really is broken. Until politicians and policymakers find ways to address those issues, economic anxiety — and its political consequences — isn’t likely to go away.

Still waiting for a CEA chair

Trump has announced nominations for nearly all the top posts in his administration. One of the last vacancies: chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, traditionally (though not always) one of the president’s most influential consultants on economic issues.

A few weeks back, it looked like Trump was poised to name CNBC talking-head Larry Kudlow to the post. The rumor drew lots of attention because of Kudlow’s unusual background for the position (he doesn’t have a degree in economics, for one). But Kudlow would also have been notable because of his strong advocacy for “supply-side economics,” which argues that lower taxes and reduced regulation are the best ways to promote economic growth. That’s hardly unusual for a Republican; supply-side theory, in one form or another, has dominated conservative economic policy since the Reagan administration. But Trump’s campaign featured an unusual (some might say awkward) blend of supply-side economics and populism — Trump’s anti-trade rhetoric is a distinct departure from supply-side orthodoxy. Observers have been watching Trump’s Cabinet picks closely to see which set of policies would have the upper hand in his administration.

With less than two weeks to go before he is sworn in, Trump has yet to name a clear supply-sider to a senior economic policy position in his administration. Wilbur Ross Jr., his pick for Commerce secretary, and Peter Navarro, who Trump has named to a newly created post overseeing trade policy, are both avowed skeptics of free trade, at least as it has been practiced in recent decades. His nominee for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, has said little about his views on economic policy.

Kudlow would represent by far the administration’s strongest advocate for supply-side policies. But the delay in filling the CEA role suggests that Kudlow doesn’t yet have the job sewn up. What Trump ultimately decides could be a key hint of where the balance of power will lie in his administration.

The week ahead

Speaking of Trump’s administration, this week brings the first wave of confirmation hearings for Cabinet nominees. Of particular note will be Thursday’s hearing for Ross, who is widely believed to be one of Trump’s closest advisers on the economy. Ross, a billionaire investor, will probably face some tough questions about potential conflicts of interest, and Democrats are sure to press him on some of his past business dealings. But so far, there is little sign of organized opposition to Ross’s nomination. Those looking for drama might have to wait until next week, when Andy Puzder, Trump’s nominee for Labor secretary, faces senators. Puzder, an outspoken critic of recent minimum wage-increases, is drawing protests from labor groups. That isn’t likely to stop his confirmation by the Republican-controlled Senate, but it could lead to some heated moments in the hearing room.

Last week at FiveThirtyEight

The new year brought pay raises to millions of low-wage workers. It also begins a large-scale experiment on the impact of minimum wages above $10 an hour.

The final jobs report of Obama’s presidency showed the U.S. adding 156,000 jobs in December. That’s a stark difference from Obama’s first jobs report, which showed the loss of nearly 600,000 jobs.

As Obamacare faces possible repeal, Anna Maria Barry-Jester looked at the law’s legacy and found that its degree of success depends heavily on which metric you choose to evaluate it.

What will a Trump presidency mean for economic data and other government statistics? We discussed the issue on FiveThirtyEight’s politics podcast.

Speaking before boarding Air Force One near his Bedminster club in New Jersey, Trump said, ""I don't see a recession.""

""I mean, the world is in a recession right now,"" he continued. ""And although that's too big a statement, but if you look at China, China is doing very, very poorly. They've had, I just saw a report, they've had the worst year in 27 years because of what I've done.""

When a reporter pointed out that some economists say Trump should prepare for a recession, Trump said, ""I'm prepared for everything.""

""Our consumers are rich,"" he added. ""I gave a tremendous tax cut, and they’re loaded up with money.""

Earlier Sunday, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow and White House Director of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Peter Navarro appeared on a series of political talk shows to defend the president's handling of the economy — particularly the ongoing trade war with China — and to downplay recent warning signs that the economy could be headed toward a downturn.

""I tell you what, I sure don't see a recession,"" Kudlow told NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""We had some blockbuster retail sales, consumer numbers toward the back end of last week. Some really blockbuster numbers. And in fact, despite a lot of worries with the volatile stock market, most economists on Wall Street toward the end of the week had been marking up their forecast for the third and fourth quarter.""

""We are doing pretty darn well in my judgment,"" Kudlow added. ""Let's not be afraid of optimism. ... I think there's a very optimistic economy going on out there.""

When ""Meet the Press"" host Chuck Todd pointed out that in 2007, just before the onset of the Great Recession, Kudlow wrote that ""there's no recession coming"" and ""the pessimistas were wrong.""

""I plead guilty to that,"" Kudlow said. Before signing off from his interview, the top White House aide added: ""Don't be afraid of optimism, Chuck.""

Fear of a recession spiked last week when a phenomena known as an ""inverted yield curve"" took place on Wednesday. That curve meant the benchmark 10-year Treasury note broke below the 2-year rate, a rare occurrence that has reliably predicted past economic recessions. The ""inverted yield curve"" coincided with an 800-point drop in the stock market, though markets experienced a slight recovery later in the week.

Trump downplayed the inverted yield curve as a warning sign, telling reporters on Sunday that, ""when you go in and analyze the curve, the curve always means that about two years later, maybe you'll go — that's a long time, two years.""

""But I don't think so,"" he added of a recession. ""Interest rates are low. I think I can be helped out by the Fed. But the Fed doesn't like helping me too much.""

Meanwhile, Trump last week, under pressure from retailers, opted to delay the implementation of more tariffs on Chinese goods until after the Christmas shopping season — a move that served as a quasi-admission that the tariffs do cause some pain for American consumers, which Trump has denied repeatedly amid his ongoing trade war with China. The Wall Street Journal editorial board strongly criticized the administration's trade efforts this week, tying them to the market volatility.

Trump and his allies have pounded two targets in response to the latest economic news — Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell and the media at large, which he claimed is trying to create a recession to harm his electoral chances.

Late last month, Powell cited ""trade policy uncertainty"" when he announced that the Fed was cutting a key interest rate for the first since 2008. Trump has long advocated for lower interest rates and complained about previous rate hikes.

On Sunday, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed that 64 percent of Americans support free trade, up 13 points from 2015 and 7 points from 2017. On Trump, 49 percent of respondents approved of his handling of the economy.

Navarro on Sunday pushed back on fears surrounding the inverted yield curve, telling ABC's ""This Week"" that, actually, such a curve did not happen ""by technical standpoints"" because ""you have to have a significant spread between short and long rates,"" something that did not take place.

All that happened, he said, was ""a flat curve.""

""We have the strongest economy in the world,"" Navarro said. ""Money is coming here for our stock market. It's also coming here to chase yield in our bond market. Now, what that does is, when foreign money comes in, it drives the prices of bonds up and yields down. That flattens the curves.""

He called on Powell to lower interest rates again, saying that previous rate hikes have ""cost"" the U.S. ""a full point of"" gross domestic product growth.

Navarro said he could say ""with certainty"" that ""we're going to have a strong economy through 2020 and beyond with a bull market,"" predicting further rate cuts, monetary easing in Europe, another fiscal stimulus in China, and what he believes is the likely passage of the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement this fall.

Hitting back at The Journal's criticism, Navarro said: ""When the Main Street journal starts attacking this administration, that is when we worry.""

""It's called 'The Wall Street Journal' for a reason. OK? It represents Wall Street,"" Navarro added. ""And 'The Wall Street Journal' never saw an American job it didn't want to offshore.""

On delaying the upcoming round of China tariffs, Navarro said the move was made because U.S. retailers had already locked in purchase orders for the Christmas season and ""did not have any power to basically shift the burden back to China.""

Speaking with CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Navarro said existing China tariffs are ""not hurting anyone here"" and are hurting China. Economists have long contended that those tariffs are being felt by U.S. consumers and businesses.

Democrats strongly pushed back on the administration's assertions. Responding to Navarro on ABC's ""This Week,"" 2020 presidential candidate and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, N.Y., said she didn't ""think his worldview is reflected in the everyday, kitchen table issues that families are facing.""

And on ""State of the Union,"" South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, another 2020 presidential candidate, said it's a ""fool's errand to think you're going to get China to change the fundamentals of their economic model by poking them in the eye with some tariffs.""

Buttigieg said U.S. farmers ""are getting killed"" by the tariffs and jabbed Trump for being unable to reach an agreement with China.

""The president has said repeatedly that he's on the cusp of getting a deal,"" Buttigieg said. ""The president has failed to deliver a deal and I expect he will continue to do so and in the meantime, we're paying the cost of these tariffs.""

Buttigieg said he believes the country is on the cusp of a recession.

""The more important thing is that even during an expansion, most Americans have not been able to get ahead,"" Buttigieg said. ""That's a problem. And the president has made it abundantly clear he doesn't care.""","(0, 'GDP')"

Since President Donald Trump took office:

The economy added 6 million jobs, and the unemployment rate dropped to the lowest level in nearly 50 years.

Economic growth fell far short of the annual 4% to 6% Trump promised. The most recent rate is 2.0%.

The federal debt went up more than $2.4 trillion. The annual deficit hit nearly $1 trillion in fiscal year 2019 – the highest since 2012.

Median household income rose 2.3%. Average weekly paychecks rose 2.8%. The poverty rate and food stamp rolls declined.

Average weekly paychecks rose 2.8%. The poverty rate and food stamp rolls declined. Stock prices rose: The S&P 500 index was up 29.8%. Single-family home prices rose nearly 23%, hitting a record level in June.

The trade deficit — which Trump promised to reduce — went up 30%.

The number of Americans lacking health insurance rose nearly 2 million.

The number of murders dropped 6.9%. But the number of rapes went up.

Illegal border crossings nearly doubled, as of the most recent 12 months on record.

Trump has filled 43 seats on federal appeals courts, compared with 25 filled by Obama at the same point in his first term.

Analysis

This is our seventh quarterly update of the “Trump’s Numbers” scorecard that we posted in January 2018 and have updated every three months, most recently on July 12. We’ll publish additional updates every three months, as fresh statistics become available.

Here we’ve included statistics that may seem good or bad or just neutral, depending on the reader’s point of view. That’s the way we did it when we posted our first “Obama’s Numbers” article seven years ago — and in the quarterly updates and final summary that followed. And we’ve maintained the same practice under Trump.

This update includes comprehensive looks at crime, income and poverty during the president’s first two years in office. The FBI’s report of crime rates for all of 2018 was released Sept. 30, and the Census Bureau’s figures for median annual household income, poverty levels and health insurance coverage during 2018 were released Sept. 10. Other statistics are released quarterly, monthly and sometimes daily, and we include here the most recent available as of this date.

Then as now, we make no judgment as to how much credit or blame any president deserves for things that happen during his time in office. Opinions differ on that.

Jobs and Unemployment

Job growth slowed a bit under Trump, but unemployment dropped to the lowest level in nearly half a century.

Employment — Total nonfarm employment grew by 6,027,000 since the president took office, according to the most recent figures available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

That continued an unbroken chain of monthly gains in total employment that started in October 2010. The economy has now added jobs for 108 consecutive months — just shy of nine years — including the first 32 months of the Trump administration.

The average monthly gain under Trump so far is 188,000 — compared with an average monthly gain of 217,000 during Obama’s second term. Trump is far behind the pace needed to fulfill his campaign boast that he will be “the greatest jobs president that God ever created.”

Unemployment — The unemployment rate, which was well below the historical norm when Trump took office, has continued to fall to the lowest rate in nearly half a century.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics now figures the rate was 4.7% when he was sworn in. The most recent rate, for September, fell to 3.5%. That’s the lowest since December 1969, nearly 50 years ago, when it was also 3.5%.

The jobless rate has been at or below 4% for the most recent 19 months — all under Trump. It hasn’t been that low for that long since a 50-month streak ending in January 1970.

The historical norm is 5.6%, which is the median monthly rate for all the months since the start of 1948.

Job Openings — One reason employment growth has slowed is a shortage of qualified workers.

The number of unfilled job openings hit more than 7.6 million in November and again in January, the highest in the 18 years the BLS has tracked this figure.

As of the last day of August, the most recent figure on record, it was nearly 7.1 million. That’s a gain of 1.4 million unfilled job openings — or 25.4% — since Trump took office.

In March of last year the number of job openings exceeded the number of unemployed people looking for work for the first time on record. And that’s been the case in every month since. In August, there were 1 million more job openings than there were people seeking jobs.

Labor Force Participation — Despite the abundance of jobs, the labor force participation rate — which went down 2.8 percentage points during the Obama years — is up slightly under Trump.

The labor force participation rate is the portion of the entire civilian population age 16 and older that is either employed or currently looking for work in the last four weeks. Republicans often criticized Obama for the decline during his time, even though it was due mostly to the post-World War II baby boomers reaching retirement age, and other demographic factors beyond the control of any president.

Since Trump took office, the rate has fluctuated in a narrow range between 63.2% and 62.7%. It was at the high end of that range in September — 0.3 percentage points above where it was the month Trump took office.

Manufacturing Jobs — Manufacturing jobs increased under Trump, but the growth has stalled recently.

The number rose by 482,000 between Trump’s inauguration and September. That followed a net decrease of 193,000 under Obama.

But the early growth during Trump’s term has faded. At first, manufacturing jobs increased even faster than total employment. But Trump’s trade disputes and tariffs have taken a toll on the manufacturing sector. During the first nine months of this year, the number of factory jobs rose 0.2%, while total employment rose four times as fast.

During all of Trump’s tenure, the grown in manufacturing jobs has been 3.9%, below the 4.1% growth for all jobs.

The number of manufacturing jobs is still 896,000 below where it was in December 2007, at the start of the Great Recession.

Economic Growth

The economy grew somewhat faster under Trump — but not at the rate he promised. Gross domestic product was growing at an annual rate of 2.0% during the second quarter of this year, after going up 2.9% in 2018 and a revised 2.4% during his first year in office.

Since our last report, the Bureau of Economic Analysis has upwardly revised its estimate of growth in 2017 by 0.2 percentage points as part of its annual update, using newly available data to refine its GDP estimates for the previous five years. Even so, growth under Trump has averaged far less than the 4% to 6% per year that he promised repeatedly, both when he was a candidate and also as president. And economists say future growth rates will be nowhere close to what Trump once claimed he could bring about.

There’s little reason to think growth will improve. The “GDPNow” forecast produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta projects that the third-quarter growth rate will come in at 1.7% based on several economic indicators that are already known.

Most economists believe this year’s growth will be less than last year’s. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s most recent economic outlook, issued Aug. 21, projects year-to-year growth of real GDP at 2.6% this year and 2.1% next year (see page 40).

A more recent median forecast of the Federal Reserve Board members and Federal Reserve Bank presidents, issued Sept. 18, projects 2.2% growth this year and 2.0% in 2020 (measured from fourth quarter to fourth quarter, rather than from year to year). That’s similar to the GDP forecasts offered by business and university economists to the Wall Street Journal’s monthly economic survey in September. Their average prediction was for only 2.2% annual growth this year and 1.7% next year.

The National Association for Business Economics’ October survey produced a median forecast of 2.3% year-to-year growth in 2019, and 1.8% in 2020.

Income and Poverty

Household Income — Household income rose briskly under Trump.

The Census Bureau’s measure of median household income reached $63,179, an increase of $1,400 from 2016 after adjusting for inflation.

In percentage terms, the increase during Trump’s first two years is 2.3%. (The median figure represents the midpoint — half of all households earned more, half less.)

The official figure is the highest ever recorded, exceeding previous records set in 2016 and 2017. But Census officials said those recent “records” are all due in part to a change in the survey questions in 2014. Starting then, the annual survey has picked up some sources of income that were previously missed.

Adjusting for that factor, and also for a change in the way Census processed data starting this year, Census officials published “estimated adjusted” figures showing what median household income would have been for past years, had the current questionnaire and processing procedures been in place. On that basis the latest figure is just a few dollars less than it was in 1999 — $63,231.

The “estimated adjusted” figures also show an even greater increase during Trump’s first two years than the official figures, because this year’s new data processing procedures had the effect of holding down income by a fraction of a percentage point. On an adjusted basis, the increase under Trump would be $1,638, or 2.7%.

Poverty — As incomes rose, the rate of poverty declined. The percentage of Americans living with income below the official poverty line went down to 11.8% of the population in 2018, the lowest level since 2001.

The poverty rate has now declined for four consecutive years, dropping by 1.3 percentage points in 2015, by 0.8 points in 2016 and by 0.4 points and 0.5 points in Trump’s first two years.

Regulations

The growth of federal regulation has stopped under Trump.

It wasn’t exactly the “sudden, screeching and beautiful halt” Trump prematurely claimed back in December 2017, when in fact the number of federal restrictions was still growing. But over the next several months the rise decelerated, and then reversed. The number of restrictions has now dropped to just below where it was when Trump was sworn in.

The number of restrictive words and phrases (such as “shall,” “prohibited” or “may not”) contained in the Code of Federal Regulations went up by 0.73% within Trump’s first 15 months, reaching a peak of nearly 1.09 million on April 6, 2018, according to daily tracking done by the QuantGov project at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center.

But as of Oct. 10, 2019, the number had dropped back below 1.08 million — 2,789 fewer than on Jan. 20, 2017, the day Trump took office.

In percentage terms, the drop is only 0.26% — barely one-quarter of 1 percentage point. But that’s a big change from the past. Restrictions grew at an average of 1.5% per year during both the Obama years and the George W. Bush years, according to annual QuantGov tracking.

The Mercatus count of restrictions doesn’t attempt to assess the cost or benefit of any particular rule — such assessments require a degree of guesswork and are sensitive to assumptions. But it does track the sheer volume of federal rules with more precision than we have found in other metrics.

Some of the recent changes are just clearing deadwood. In March, for example, the Internal Revenue Service removed 296 regulations that it said “are no longer necessary because they do not have any current or future applicability.” And last year the Treasury Department scrapped an entire chapter of zombie-like regulations issued by the old Office of Thrift Supervision, which oversaw the savings-and-loan industry before being abolished in 2011. S&Ls have since fallen under other federal banking regulators, but the obsolete OTS rules remained on the books.

However, many of the rules Trump has eliminated are quite significant.

Within a month of taking office, for example, Trump signed a law nullifying an Obama-era rule restricting coal mining companies from dumping waste into streams and waterways. Last year his administration proposed withdrawing Obama’s edict requiring automakers to increase the fuel efficiency of new cars and light trucks to 46.8 miles per gallon by the year 2025. Instead, the requirement would be capped at the 2020 level of 37 mpg. And in September the EPA’s Affordable Clean Energy rule took effect, repealing the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan rule. The Obama-era rule was designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by shifting away from coal as an energy source and would have required states to meet specific emissions reductions.

Crime

Crime declined during Trump’s first two years, except for rape, which increased.

The FBI’s annual Crime in the United States report, released Sept. 30, shows 1,199 fewer murders were committed in 2018 than in 2016, when Trump was elected. That’s a decline of 6.9%.

But despite that decline, the murder rate per 100,000 people, which was 5.0 last year, still was above the record low set in 2014, when it was 4.4.

As a candidate, Trump repeatedly claimed that the murder rate was “the highest it’s been in 45 years.” That was far from true. The rate did rise during President Obama’s final two years, to 5.4 per 100,000 in 2016. But the highest rate in the past half century was 10.2 in 1980.

Overall, the rate of violent crimes per 100,000 people went down 4.6% during Trump’s first two years. That included a 16.2% drop in the robbery rate, and a 0.6% decline in the rate of aggravated assault.

However, the number of reported rapes per 100,000 people went up — by 4.2%. (A rise in rapes and sexual assault in 2018 was also noted in the National Crime Victimization Survey, released Sept. 10, which covers crimes that are not reported to police, as well as those that are.)

The number of property crimes per 100,000 people went down 10.3% during Trump’s first two years, including a 19.8% drop in the burglary rate, an 8.6% drop in the rate of larcenies (such as shoplifting), and a 3.5% decline in the rate of motor vehicle thefts.

Guns

Sales and production of guns pulled back under Trump, after surging to record levels during the Obama years.

Handgun Production — In 2018, annual production of pistols and revolvers in the U.S. totaled just under 4.3 million, according to preliminary figures from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, released July 22.

That represented a decline of 23% from 2016, when production surged to a record level of nearly 5.6 million.

Handgun production more than tripled during the Obama years. So the 2018 level was still 135% higher than it had been in 2008, the last year of George W. Bush’s presidency.

Gun Sales — Gun sales also dropped — though the decline seems to have leveled off this year.

The government doesn’t collect figures on sales of guns. But the National Shooting Sports Foundation — the gun industry’s trade group — tracks approximate sales figures by adjusting FBI statistics on background checks to remove those not related to actual sales, such as checks required for concealed-carry permits.

Those NSSF-adjusted figures dropped from a record 15.7 million in Obama’s final year to 13.1 million last year — a decrease of 16.5%.

Sales for this year have been mixed. They dropped further during the first half of the year but bounced back during the July-September quarter. The NSSF figures for the first six months of 2019 were 5.3% lower than for the same period in 2018. But the third-quarter figures were 9.1% higher than the year-earlier figures.

Overall, figures for the first nine months of 2019 were a scant 1.1% below the same period in 2018.

These figures cover rifles and shotguns and previously owned weapons, as well as new handguns. They are only an approximation of actual sales, since some of these checks cover purchases of multiple weapons, and of course some sales still occur without background checks.

Coal and Environment

Coal Mining Jobs — As a candidate, Trump promised to “put our [coal] miners back to work,” but so far not many have regained their jobs.

A total of 35,600 coal mining jobs disappeared during the Obama years, but as of September, only 2,500 of them had come back since Trump took office, according to BLS figures.

The outlook for coal miners remains bleak. The Energy Information Administration reports that U.S. consumption of coal reached a 39-year low last year. And EIA predicts that will fall another 10% this year, and 11% more in 2020. EIA expects natural gas will continue to displace coal for the generation of electricity.

Carbon Emissions — Carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption have gone up under Trump, after falling for years before he took office.

Figures from the Energy Information Administration show CO2 emissions were 0.9% higher in the most recent 12 months on record (ending in June) than they were in 2016.

In the decade before Trump took office, emissions fell by a total of 14.5%, due mainly to electric utilities shifting away from coal-fired plants in favor of cheaper, cleaner natural gas, as well as solar and wind power. Under Trump, the trend first slowed — emissions fell only 0.8% in 2017 — and then reversed entirely — rising 2.7% in 2018.

The 2018 rise is turning out to be a temporary blip — brought on by a hotter summer and colder winter than normal, resulting in higher natural gas consumption. EIA is currently predicting that CO2 emissions will fall by 2.4% in 2019 — if temperatures return to normal as forecast. But so far, there has been a net gain in total carbon emissions since Trump took office.

Border Security

Illegal border crossings surged under Trump, to the highest levels in well over a decade, but have dropped considerably in recent months.

In May, 132,859 people were apprehended trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border without permission, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. That was the highest total since March 2006, when the monthly total hit nearly 161,000.

But monthly apprehensions fell in each of the next three months, totaling 50,693 in August.

That still leaves the average monthly total for this year at 82,176. That is higher than the monthly average for any full year since 2006, when it hit 84,800.

For the most recent 12 months on record, the monthly average was 71,042 which is 92.5% higher than the monthly average of 36,912 in 2016. We use this rolling monthly average for our chart, because these monthly figures are subject to wide seasonal variations.

Of those apprehended in August, 43% were single adults. The rest, nearly 57%, were either unaccompanied children or part of “family units” made up of a child under 18 accompanied by a parent or guardian. Border Patrol officials said they are coming primarily from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, and many are seeking asylum. It’s a big change from the days when most such attempted border crossings were made by Mexican males seeking work.

Corporate Profits

After-tax corporate profits are running at near record levels under Trump. During 2018, they hit $1.84 trillion for the year, just under the record $1.86 trillion recorded for 2014. During the second quarter of 2019, profits still were running at a yearly rate of $1.86 trillion.

Since our last report — when we said profits in 2018 set a record $1.95 trillion — the Bureau of Economic Analysis revised its annual and quarterly estimates of after-tax profits (on line 45) as part of its annual update, using newly available data to refine its estimates for the previous five years. The 2018 figure was revised downward.

Still, the most recent quarter’s annual rate is 6.9% higher than the full-year figure for 2016, the year before Trump’s inauguration.

Stock Market

Stock prices continued their decade-long rise with Trump in office — but seem to have hit a ceiling since our last report.

Market indexes set record after record in 2018, only to plunge during the worst December since 1931 and then bounce back during the best first quarter in a decade, and go on to set new records in July, as we reported in our last update.

Stock prices have slipped downward a bit since then. But even so, at the close on Oct. 10, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock average was 29.8% higher than it was on the last trading day before Trump’s inauguration.

Other indexes took similar rides. At the Oct. 10 close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, made up of 30 large corporations, was up 34.3% under Trump. And the NASDAQ composite index, made up of more than 3,000 companies, closed on Oct. 10 at 43.5% higher than before Trump took office.

The bull market began its rise in the depths of the Great Recession in 2009, and became the longest in history last year. This year it passed its 10th anniversary in March.

Wages and Inflation

The upward trend in real wages continued under Trump, and inflation remained in check.

CPI — The Consumer Price Index rose 5.2% during Trump’s first 32 months, continuing a long period of historically low inflation.

In the most recent 12 months, ending in September, the CPI rose 1.7%. The CPI rose an average of 1.8% each year of the Obama presidency (measured as the 12-month change ending each January), and an average of 2.4% during each of George W. Bush’s years.

Wages — Paychecks continued to grow faster than prices.

The average weekly earnings of all private-sector workers, in “real” (inflation-adjusted) terms, rose 2.8% during Trump’s first 32 months (ending in September) after going up 3.9% during the previous four years.

Those figures are for all private-sector workers, including managers and supervisors.

For rank-and-file production and nonsupervisory workers (who make up 82% of all private-sector workers), real weekly earnings have gone up 3.2% so far under Trump, after rising 4.9% during Obama’s last four years in office.

Consumer Sentiment

Consumer confidence in the economy first rose, then sagged under Trump.

The University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers monthly index peaked at 101.4 in March of last year, which was the highest in 14 years. Since then it has gone down to 93.2 as of September — a decline of 5.3 points since Trump took office.

However, the most recent index is still 6.0 points above where it was in October 2016 — just before Trump was elected — after promising to boost economic growth to levels not seen in decades.

Home Prices and Ownership

Home Prices — Home prices soared to record levels under Trump.

Since our last report, the national median price of an existing, single-family home set another record, peaking at $288,500 in June, according to sales figures from the National Association of Realtors.

Lately prices have moderated a bit, but still stood at $280,700 in August, the most recent monthly figure available. That is $52,000 higher than the median price of $228,700 for homes sold during the month Trump took office — a gain in value of 22.7%. The rise in the Consumer Price Index during the same period was 5.1%.

The Realtors’ figures reflect raw sales prices without attempting to adjust for such factors as variations in the size, location, age or condition of the homes sold in a given month or year. Even so, a similar pattern emerges from the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, which compares sales prices of similar homes and seeks to measure changes in the total value of all existing single-family housing stock.

The Case-Shiller index for July sales (the most recent available) was 14.6% above where it stood in the month Trump took office.

Whichever way you measure it, homeowners have seen the value of their houses rise substantially since Trump became president.

Homeownership — The percentage of Americans who own their homes at first continued to recover under Trump, but lately has taken a dip.

Back in 2004 the homeownership rate hit a record 69.2% of households for two quarters, but then began a years-long slide, hitting bottom in the second quarter of 2016 at 62.9%. That was the lowest point in more than half a century, and tied for the lowest on record.

The rate recovered 0.8 points in the six months before Trump took office, and went up another 1.1 points during his first two years, reaching 64.8% in the fourth quarter of 2018.

But most of that gain under Trump was erased in the first half of this year, according to the most recent Census Bureau figures.

The most recent rate, for the second quarter of 2019, stands at 64.1%. That’s 0.4 percentage point higher than the quarter before Trump took office, but still a full 5 points below the peak level of 15 years earlier.

Trade

The trade deficit that Trump promised to reduce grew much larger instead.

The most recent government figures show that the total U.S. trade deficit in goods and services during the most recent 12 months on record (ending in August) was $656 billion. That’s an increase of $153 billion, or 30.4%, compared with 2016.

China — The goods-and-services trade deficit with China grew at a somewhat slower pace, up by 17.2% between 2016 and the most recent 12 months on record (ending in June) when it hit $362 billion.

Trump last year initiated a full-scale trade conflict with China, imposing tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods. China has retaliated with its own tariffs on $110 billion of U.S. goods. Trump met personally with Chinese President Xi Jinping on June 29 in Osaka, Japan, but it remains to be seen how the trade war will be resolved, and what effect that might have on future trade.

Mexico — Meanwhile, the much smaller trade deficit in goods and services with Mexico totaled $92 billion during the 12 months ending in June, an increase of 49% compared with 2016.

Canada — The trade surplus that the U.S. runs with Canada has dwindled to nearly nothing under Trump. The trade balance was positive by $697 million during the 12 months ending in June. That surplus has shrunk by 90.6% since 2016.

On Nov. 30 last year Trump and the leaders of Canada and Mexico signed a new trade agreement to replace the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump had promised to scrap during his campaign. The new agreement will be called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. The new agreement still requires approval by Congress before it can take effect. But Democrats who control the House want stronger enforcement for labor and environmental standards, and changes in patent protections for drug companies, and have not allowed a vote on the measure.

Health Insurance Coverage

The number of people lacking health insurance rose by nearly 2 million under Trump.

The U.S. Census Bureau reported Sept. 10 that the number of Americans who lacked health insurance for all of 2018 was 27.5 million — up from 25.6 million in 2017. It was the first time in a decade that this number increased. The percentage of Americans without coverage for the entire year rose to 8.5%, from 7.9% the year before.

The Census report confirmed a trend we’ve been tracking using a somewhat different measure released on a more frequent and timely basis by the National Health Interview Survey. As we reported in our July update, the NHIS put the number of people who lacked coverage at the time they were interviewed — not necessarily for the entire year — at 30.4 million in 2018, an increase of 1.8 million over 2016.

The NHIS said 9.4% of the population lacked coverage at the time of interview in 2018, up from 9% in 2016.

A much greater rise was reported by a Gallup survey covering the final quarter of 2018. Gallup on Jan. 23 put the rise in uninsured adults at about 7 million, compared with the last half of 2016. Gallup put the percentage of uninsured adults at 13.7% in the October-December quarter. For details, see our Feb. 12 story, “Did the Uninsured Increase by 7 Million?“

Trump failed to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act as he promised to do, but did slash advertising and outreach aimed at enrolling people in Obamacare plans. In December 2017 he signed a tax bill that ended the ACA’s tax penalty for people who fail to obtain coverage, effective this year. And in March the Trump administration joined an effort by GOP state attorneys general seeking a court decision to overturn the entire act. That case, Texas v. U.S., was argued July 9 before the U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans. The court has not yet issued its ruling in that case.

Food Stamps

The number of food stamp recipients dropped to the lowest levels in a decade.

Earlier this year the number dropped below 37 million for the first time since October 2009, when millions were signing up for benefits in the aftermath of the Great Recession of 2007-2009.

As of July, the most recent month for which figures are available, 36.3 million people were receiving the aid.

The number of food stamp recipients has gone down 6.4 million, or 15.1%, since January 2017, when Trump took office.

The number of recipients is now 11.5 million below the peak month of December 2012. But it is still 8.9 million above where it was at the start of the Great Recession, in December 2007, despite years of an improving economy.

The administration is working to reduce the number further. A proposed rule to tighten work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents would cause 755,000 individuals to lose eligibility, if and when it is implemented, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates.

And in July, the Trump administration proposed another rule that it said could remove another 3 million people from the rolls. That rule would take away flexibility that many states now use to grant food aid to people with income or assets exceeding federal limits.

Judiciary Appointments

Trump is putting his mark on the federal appeals courts more quickly than Obama was able to do in his time in office.

Supreme Court — So far Trump has won Senate confirmation for two Supreme Court nominees, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.

Obama also was able to fill two high court vacancies during his first two years in office, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Elena Kagan. But the Kavanaugh nomination to fill the vacancy created by Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement is significant because Kavanaugh may move the court to the right. He is considered to be more conservative than Kennedy, who sometimes sided with the liberal justices to provide deciding votes on issues including gay rights, abortion, capital punishment and affirmative action.

However, Kavanaugh disappointed abortion foes when he sided with the court’s liberals on one of his first votes, against taking up a case about whether citizens should be allowed to sue states that cut off Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood health clinics.

Court of Appeals — Trump also won confirmation of 43 U.S. Court of Appeals judges (30 during his first two years and another 13 in the current Congress as of Oct. 7). That’s nearly double the total for Obama, who won confirmation for 25 as of the same point in his first term (16 during his first two years and nine more in the 112th Congress as of Oct 11, 2011).

Trump has now installed 24% of all the 179 appellate court judges authorized by federal law.

District Court — Trump also outpaced Obama on filling lower courts. Trump has won confirmation for 105 of his nominees to be federal District Court judges as of Oct. 7. That’s nearly 16% of the 677 authorized district judges. Obama had won confirmation for 87 at the same point in his presidency.

Trump has also filled two seats on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, which has nationwide jurisdiction over lawsuits seeking money from the government. And he has filled two seats on the U.S. Court for International Trade. Obama had filled none at the same point in his first term.

Trump must share responsibility for this record with the Republican majority in the Senate. Republicans not only refused to consider Obama’s appointment of Merrick Garland to fill the Supreme Court vacancy eventually filled by Gorsuch, but they also blocked confirmation of dozens of Obama’s nominees to lower courts. Trump inherited 17 Court of Appeals vacancies, for example, including seven that had Obama nominees pending but never confirmed.

Federal Debt and Deficits

The federal debt went up more than $2 trillion under Trump, as trillion-dollar annual federal deficits returned. And there’s no end in sight.

The federal debt held by the public stood at $16.8 trillion at the last count on Oct. 9 — an increase of more than $2.4 trillion since he took office. That’s a 16.7% increase under Trump. And that figure will go up even more quickly in coming years unless Trump and Congress impose massive spending cuts, or reverse course and increase taxes.

Trump’s cuts in corporate and individual income tax rates — as well as the bipartisan spending deal he signed Feb. 9, 2018 — are causing the red ink to gush even faster than it did before.

The federal government’s annual deficit hit $779 billion in fiscal year 2018. CBO estimates that the deficit for fiscal year 2019 (which ended Sept. 30) was $984 billion, based on daily Treasury statements. (The Treasury Department will issue the final, official figure later this month.)

That’s 2.5% higher than CBO estimated as recently as Aug. 21, in its latest update of its Budget and Economic Outlook, when it projected a FY2019 deficit of $960 billion. In that report, CBO said that under current law annual deficits will top $1 trillion in the fiscal year that just started, and average $1.2 trillion each year from 2020 through 2029.

The debt is now equal to about 78% of the nation’s entire gross domestic product. CBO said Oct. 3 that if current laws aren’t changed, the debt “would approach 100 percent of GDP by the end of the next decade and 152 percent by 2048.” That would be far higher than the debt the U.S. ran up during World War II, which was the highest in the nation’s history.","(4, 'national debt')"
376,How much credit should President Trump get for the economy? - Marketplace,How much credit should President Trump get for the economy?  Marketplace,"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHBsYWNlLm9yZy8yMDE4LzAxLzI5L2hvdy1tdWNoLWNyZWRpdC1zaG91bGQtcHJlc2lkZW50LXRydW1wLWdldC1lY29ub215L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Marketplace,"The White House said President Trump’s first State of the Union address will focus on the administration’s accomplishments in Trump’s first year in office.

Among the wins Trump is set to highlight is the economy. But how much of the strong economy can really be attributed to an administration’s first year? Economists say the president’s regular tweets claiming responsibility for the booming stock market and low unemployment are a bit of a stretch.

“The state of the economy is naturally much more influenced by what happened before you became president,” said Alan Blinder, who was a member of President Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisors and is now an economics professor at Princeton. He said that as a presidency progresses, and policies have time to take effect, that balance shifts.

For example, the low unemployment under the Trump administration is a continuation of a trend that goes back to 2009. Blinder said there is an argument to be made, though, for Trump having some influence on the stock market.

“I find it believable that when you get a president who tells the public and the business community that he’s going to cut their taxes … and he tells you he’s going to deregulate, drop all kinds of regulations, it’s quite a reasonable supposition to think that that pushes the stock market higher,” said Blinder.

Lee Branstetter, who served on President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisors, said there’s generally a built-in lag between new policies and their impact on the broader economy. Usually, around six months to a year after a major piece of legislation.

“The president really hasn’t had much time or much opportunity to implement policies that are significant enough and impactful enough to really move the needle in terms of economic growth,” said Branstetter, who is now a professor of Economics at Carnegie Mellon University.

Trump’s first major policy accomplishment was the new tax law, just passed last month. And though there have been some announcements of bonuses and companies bringing money back to the U.S., it’s still going to take a while for the effects of the law to filter through the broader economy.

Trump will likely use the State of the Union address as a chance to set the narrative that the continuation of positive news for the economy is due to his administration. A recent Gallup poll found 56 percent of Americans credit Obama for the “improved U.S. economy,” compared to 49 percent who credit President Trump.","(0, 'GDP')"
377,AP FACT CHECK: Trump myths on economy; Dems' selective facts - The Associated Press,AP FACT CHECK: Trump myths on economy; Dems' selective facts  The Associated Press,"Sun, 15 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzZmOWQ3ODE3YTkxNDRjNDdhMmQ2Mjg5MjAyOTVjYThi0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,The Associated Press,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The country described by the Democrats running for president is mired in child poverty, riven with economic unfairness and broken in its approach to health care, crime and guns. The country presented by President Donald Trump is roaring and ascendant , shattering all economic records for performance.

The reality, of course, is more complex.

After three turns on the debate stage by the Democratic candidates, it’s become clear that for the most part they hew to actual statistics and other fundamentals more closely than does Trump, who routinely says false things and repeats them as if willing them into being.

That’s not to say the Democrats are beacons of accuracy. Some will use older statistics when newer ones don’t suit their argument or give a selective reading of history when that fits the story they want to tell. Sometimes what they don’t say speaks loudly, as when they won’t acknowledge the cost of their plans or the likely tax hit on average people.

A sampling:

ECONOMY AND TRADE

TRUMP: “All time best unemployment numbers, especially for Blacks, Hispanics, Asians & Women.” — tweet Friday.

THE FACTS: The unemployment rate for women has not reached an “all time best” during the Trump administration.

It did fall to 3.1% in April, the lowest since October 1953. But that is still far higher than the record set in May 1953 of 2.4%.

It’s a fact that Trump has acknowledged, having repeatedly joked at campaign rallies this year how he’s fallen short on the women’s unemployment rate. “I always say kiddingly, ‘I’m sorry I didn’t make it historic’ but you know what, it’s going to be historic very soon,” he said last week in North Carolina.

Since April, the unemployment rate for women has actually ticked higher to 3.3%.

___

TRUMP: “How do you impeach a President who has helped create perhaps the greatest economy in the history of our Country?” — tweet Friday.

THE FACTS: “Perhaps” is a rare bit of modesty in this frequent boast by Trump but he is still wrong in claiming the U.S. has its best economy ever.

In the late 1990s, growth topped 4% for four straight years, a level it has not reached on an annual basis under Trump. Growth reached 7.2% in 1984. The economy grew 2.9% in 2018 — the same pace it reached in 2015 under President Barack Obama — and hasn’t hit historically high growth rates.

The unemployment rate is near a 50-year low of 3.7%, but the proportion of Americans with a job was higher in the 1990s. More Americans are now out of the workforce, taking care of children or relatives, or going to school, while others became discouraged about their job prospects and stopped looking. The government doesn’t count people as unemployed unless they are actively searching for jobs. Wages were rising at a faster pace back then, too.

___

TRUMP, on China’s economy. “By the way, China is having the worst year they’ve had now in 57 years, OK? Fifty-seven.” — remarks Wednesday in meeting on e-cigarettes.

TRUMP: “They’ve had now the worst year in 57 years.” — North Carolina rally on Sept. 9.

THE FACTS: That’s not true. China is far from the impoverished disaster of a half century ago, when it was reeling from the massive famine caused by Mao Zedong’s radical economic policies and heading into the chaos of the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s.

China’s economy is indeed slowing from Trump’s taxes on Chinese imports, as well as its own campaign to constrain runaway debt. The International Monetary Fund expects the Chinese economy to grow 6.2% this year. That’s the slowest growth for China in nearly 30 years. But it’s still markedly faster than U.S. growth.

Since overhauling its economy in the late 1970s, China has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, established a growing middle class and surpassed Japan to become the world’s second-biggest economy.

___

TRUMP: “Hundreds of billions of dollars have been and are coming into our country in the form of tariffs, and China is eating the cost.” — remarks at North Carolina rally on Sept. 9.

THE FACTS: Americans are also eating the cost.

As he escalates a trade war with China, Trump refuses to recognize that tariffs are mainly, if not entirely, paid by companies and consumers in the country that imposes them.

In a study in May, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, with Princeton and Columbia universities, estimated that tariffs from Trump’s trade dispute with China were costing $831 per U.S. household on an annual basis, before tariffs were recently escalated. Analysts also found that the burden of Trump’s tariffs falls entirely on U.S. consumers and businesses that buy imported products.

A report last month by JPMorgan Chase estimated that tariffs would cost the average American household $1,000 per year if tariffs on an additional $300 billion of U.S. imports from China proceed in September and December. Trump has since bumped up the scheduled levies even higher, probably adding to the U.S. burden.

BERNIE SANDERS: “We have the highest child poverty rate of almost any country on Earth.” — Democratic debate.

THE FACTS: This oft-repeated line by the Vermont senator is an exaggeration.

There are nearly 200 countries in the world, many with people living in extreme poverty that most Americans would struggle to fathom. Poverty is also a relative measure in which someone who is poor in one nation might look rather prosperous in another.

But the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development updated its child poverty report in 2018. The United States had an above average level of child poverty, but it was not at the bottom of the 42 nations listed in the report. The United States still fared better than Russia, Chile, Spain, India, Turkey, Israel, Costa Rica, Brazil, South Africa and China.

___

TRUMP: “We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history.” — North Carolina rally.

THE FACTS: His tax cuts are nowhere close to the biggest in U.S. history.

It’s a $1.5 trillion tax cut over 10 years. As a share of the total economy, a tax cut of that size ranks 12th, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. President Ronald Reagan’s 1981 cut is the biggest, followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed World War II.

Post-Reagan tax cuts also stand among the historically significant: President George W. Bush’s cuts in the early 2000s and Obama’s renewal of them a decade later.

___

GUNS

TRUMP: “Democrats want to confiscate guns from law-abiding Americans so they’re totally defenseless when somebody walks into their house with a gun.” — remarks Thursday to House Republicans in Baltimore.

THE FACTS: That’s a vast overstatement. No Democratic candidates have proposed stripping all guns from Americans. One of the top 10 candidates, former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, has proposed confiscating assault-type weapons such as the AK-47 through a mandatory buyback program.

___

MIGRANTS

JOE BIDEN, on the treatment of migrants in his time as Obama’s vice president: “We didn’t lock people up in cages.” — Democratic presidential debate Thursday.

THE FACTS: Yes, they did.

The “cages” — chain-link enclosures inside border facilities where migrants have been temporarily housed, separated by sex and age — were built and used by the Obama administration. The Trump administration has been using the same facilities.

Democrats routinely accuse Trump of using cages for migrant children without acknowledging the same enclosures were employed when Biden was vice president.

HEALTH CARE

BERNIE SANDERS: “Every study done shows that ‘Medicare for All’ is the most cost-effective approach to providing health care to every man, woman and child in this country.” — Democratic debate.

THE FACTS: No, not every study.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a report earlier this year that total spending under a single-payer system, such as the one proposed by Sanders, “might be higher or lower than under the current system depending on the key features of the new system.”

Those features involve details about payment rates for hospitals and doctors, which are not fully spelled out by Sanders, as well as the estimated cost of generous benefits that include long-term care services and no copays and deductibles for comprehensive medical care.

A report this year by the Rand think tank estimated that Medicare for All would modestly raise national health spending, the opposite of what the Vermont senator intends.

Rand modeled a hypothetical scenario in which a plan similar to legislation by the Vermont senator had taken effect this year. It found that total U.S. health care spending would be about $3.9 trillion under Medicare for All in 2019, compared with about $3.8 trillion under the status quo.

Part of the reason is that Medicare for All would offer generous benefits with no copays and deductibles, except limited cost-sharing for certain medications. Virtually free comprehensive medical care would lead to big increases in the demand for services.

TRUMP: “Our ambitious campaign to reduce the price of prescription drugs has produced the largest decline in drug prices in more than 51 years.” — North Carolina rally on Sept. 9.

THE FACTS: He’s exaggerating his influence on drug prices, which haven’t fallen for brand-name drugs, the area that worries consumers the most.

Most of his administration’s “ambitious campaign” to reduce drug prices has yet to be completed. Major regulations are in the works and legislation has yet to be passed by Congress. A rule requiring drugmakers to disclose prices in TV ads has been blocked for now by the courts.

Harsh criticism of the industry — from Trump and lawmakers of both parties in Congress — may be having some effect, however.

The Commerce Department’s inflation index for prescription drug prices has declined in seven of the past eight months, which is highly unusual. That index includes lower-cost generic drugs, which account for 90% of prescriptions filled in the U.S. Prices for generics have been declining under pressure from big drug distributors.

For brand-name drugs, though, a recent analysis by The Associated Press shows that on average prices are still going up, but at a slower pace. The cost of brand-name drugs is what’s most concerning to consumers, with insured patients facing steep copays for some medications.

The AP analysis found that in the first seven months of 2019, drugmakers raised list prices for brand-name medicines by a median, or midpoint, of 5%.

That does reflect a slowing in price increases. They were going up 9% or 10% over those months the prior four years. But it’s not a decrease in actual prices. There were 37 price increases for every decrease in the first seven months of 2019. Pricing data for the AP analysis came from the health information firm Elsevier.

ELIZABETH WARREN, asked whether her health plan would mean higher middle-class taxes: “We pay for it, those at the very top, the richest individuals and the biggest corporations, are going to pay more. And middle-class families are going to pay less. That’s how this is going to work. ... Look, what families have to deal with is cost, total cost.”

THE FACTS: That’s a dodge.

The senator from Massachusetts did not answer back-to-back questions about whether middle class taxes would go up from her version of Medicare for All.

It’s a given that consumers will pay less for health care if the government picks up the bills. But Sanders is almost alone among the candidates who support Medicare for All in acknowledging that broadly higher taxes would be needed to pay for that universal coverage. He would consider, and probably not be able to avoid, a tax increase on the middle class in exchange for health care without copayments, deductibles and the like. “Yes, they will pay more in taxes but less in health care,” he said in a June debate.

Some rivals, including Warren, have only spoken about taxing the wealthy and “Wall Street.” Analysts say that’s not going to cover the costs of government-financed universal care.

___

VETERANS

TRUMP: “We passed something they wanted to do for half a century: We passed VA Choice.” — North Carolina rally.

THE FACTS: It was Obama who won passage of the Veterans Choice program, which gives veterans the option to see private doctors outside the VA medical system at government expense. Congress approved the program in 2014, and Obama signed it into law. Trump expanded it.

EL PASO

BETO O’ROURKE, former U.S. representative from Texas, on last month’s mass shooting in El Paso: “Everything that I’ve learned about resilience, I’ve learned from my hometown of El Paso, Texas, in the face of this act of terror, that was directed at our community, in large part by the president of United States. It killed 22 people, and injured many more, we were not defeated by that. Nor were we defined by that.” — Democratic debate.

THE FACTS: Nobody has claimed that Trump “directed” the shooting. Earlier in the debate, O’Rourke had said the shooter was “inspired to kill by our president.” It is hard to know for sure what led the gunman to open fire inside a Walmart in El Paso, killing 22 people. The suspect posted a manifesto online before the shooting that echoed Trump’s comments on immigration. Yet the suspect said his own views “predate Trump and his campaign for president.”

The screed spoke of what the suspect called a “Hispanic invasion of Texas,” railed against immigrants and warned of an imminent attack. Nearly all of the victims had Latino last names.

The suspect purchased the gun legally, according to El Paso’s police chief.

___

RUSSIA INVESTIGATION

KAMALA HARRIS, on Trump: “The only reason he has not been indicted is because there was a memo in the Department of Justice that says a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime.” — Democratic debate.

THE FACTS: We don’t know that it’s the only reason. Former special counsel Robert Mueller didn’t go that far in his report on Russian intervention in the 2016 election and obstruction of justice.

Harris, a California senator, is referring to a Justice Department legal opinion that says sitting presidents are immune from indictment. Mueller has said his investigators were restrained by that rule, but he also said that they never reached a determination as to whether the president committed a crime.

In Mueller’s congressional testimony in July, he said his team never started the process of evaluating whether to charge Trump.

President Donald Trump said Thursday that the United States could reach a trade agreement with China in the next month, a deal Washington hopes will curb the abuses of Beijing’s state capitalism and nudge China toward a more market-friendly economy.

But to do that, the Trump administration’s economic prescription is increasingly to turn its back on the free market and adopt an ever-growing role for the government in the day-to-day workings of the economy, a situation experts say is nearly without precedent in modern U.S. history.

Since taking office, Trump has unilaterally levied legally dubious tariffs on friends and rivals alike that have created distortions throughout the economy and forced many firms to beg the government for hard-to-get exclusions. When China retaliated against U.S. tariffs by boycotting U.S. farm goods, Trump used government money to bail out farmers.

He has sought, like mercantilists centuries ago, to manage trade at a government-to-government level; a big part of the looming China trade deal is expected to include Chinese commitments to purchase U.S. commodities. He is forcing companies to tear up their existing supply chains and make manufacturing more expensive. He has tried to interfere in the electricity sector by offering government support for politically favored sectors like coal.

Most recently, he has politicized the Federal Reserve, trying to influence its decisions on interest rates and the economy to serve partisan purposes. He is also trying to turn the famously independent monetary body into an appendix of the executive branch by nominating Trump supporters and Fed critics to the Federal Reserve’s board. He has also threatened to close the southern border entirely, sending shivers down the spine of thousands of American businesses that rely on seamless cross-border trade with Mexico.

The increased role of the government in the U.S. economy is jarring to see from a nominally Republican administration, especially one that rails against the supposed dangers of socialism as advocated by a growing number of Democratic lawmakers. It also goes beyond the flirtations with protectionism that marked the Ronald Reagan White House or the heavy-handed economic interventions of the Richard Nixon years.

“There actually is little U.S. precedent for this approach,” said Adam Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “The current Trump combination of very arbitrary state intervention, with a lot of company and sector-specific discretion by the president regarding tariffs and which countries to hit, is out there on its own.”

Posen noted previous U.S. bouts of protectionism and state-directed investments in the 19th century. But he said the current administration’s economic nationalism, which mixes old-fashioned protectionism with “national security jingoism,” has uglier analogues than the Gilded Age.

“It is similar to other periods in Latin America, India, and the fascist European regimes of the early 20th century,” Posen said.

In the wake of the devastating financial crisis and recession a decade ago, many countries have sought to temper the market’s role in the economy, believing it to be a source of inequality and instability. But not even countries that were hammered by the crisis have turned to statist solutions to quite this degree, Posen said.

“Mexico, Ireland, Spain, and Portugal all had pretty bad crises, but are not seeing this take hold as much or engender as much discretionary state intervention,” he said.

Rather, the Trump administration’s willingness to interfere with the free market is in many ways a natural consequence of the president’s economic nationalism. When the nation’s supposed interests are paramount, the state becomes the tool, and the market an obstacle to be overcome.

Traditional small-government conservatives, who have dominated the Republican Party in recent years, seek to make markets the arbiters and leave individuals and companies freedom to operate, with the government merely enforcing the rules of the road. Trump’s approach turns Republican orthodoxy on its head.

That helps explain why he embraces tariffs, like the threatened levies on imported cars, even when the industry he is allegedly protecting begs and pleads to be left alone. Or why he has maintained harmful and expensive tariffs on steel and aluminum imports that raise costs for nearly all U.S. manufacturers to benefit a tiny handful of metals producers. Or why he has tried to artificially prop up coal’s place in the energy mix, despite its lack of economic appeal for power producers.

“A small-government conservative would, say, set up a process that avoids the government picking winners and losers. He [Trump] wants to pick the winners and losers. He wants to be the guy who says ‘I delivered those jobs’ or ‘I saved those jobs,’” said Phil Levy, a former George W. Bush economic advisor and now a senior fellow on the economy at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. “It’s antithetical to the whole mindset of small-government conservatives.”

But the turn toward statism isn’t just an idiosyncrasy of Trump’s. It reflects the wider administration’s belief that in today’s world, economic competition is a national—not just a corporate—endeavor, one that requires government, not just private sector, involvement.

Take the U.S. Export-Import Bank, an agency meant to help promote U.S. exports overseas. For years, Republicans attacked the bank as government welfare for big business and tried to starve it. While running for president, Trump also opposed the bank.

Now, though, a more activist state export bank is part of the administration’s toolkit to take on economies such as China’s where the state plays a much bigger role. Larry Kudlow, the chief White House economic advisor, said late last month that he generally frowns on government subsidies for business but supports a bigger role for the Export-Import Bank to compete with China. Peter Navarro, a White House trade and economic advisor, also said that the government needs to put its thumb on the scales if the United States is to compete with other big economies.

“Here’s another brutal truth: The fight for exports in world markets is no longer just company versus company. It is also country versus country,” he wrote in a recent op-ed.

How has Trump’s statist approach to the economy managed to prevail with Republicans in charge of Congress for the first two years of his administration? On the one hand, Trump offered Republicans victories on many bread-and-butter issues they craved, including tax cuts and regulatory cutbacks across the board, in addition to a pair of conservative Supreme Court justices. Those Republican wins overshadowed the lurch away from market economics.

At the same time, Trump and others in the administration have often suggested that they are actually free traders and would prefer less of a state role in the economy. Trump himself sometimes talks of slashing tariffs to zero if other countries do, and surrogates continue to peddle the notion that Trump ultimately seeks free trade. But his own statements and policies suggest otherwise. Trump has insisted that he likes tariffs, has repeatedly abused national security provisions to levy trade restrictions, and has refused to lift tariffs on other countries—most notably Canada and Mexico—even after they’ve done his bidding.

Those rhetorical bones tossed toward orthodox Republican economic views, Levy said, managed to keep opposition from within the party at bay for most of the past two years.

“People actually believed it, and that papered over the differences,” he said. More recently, however, Congress has begun pushing back against some of Trump’s protectionist policies, with momentum growing in the Senate to rein in the president’s ability to unilaterally levy tariffs on specious national security grounds.

A bigger question is how the administration hopes to pressure Beijing into lessening the role of the state in the economy and embracing the market when Washington is moving in exactly the opposite direction. Far from beating them, the administration’s economic policy seems to be to joining them.

“The complaints about Chinese support of state-owned enterprises and other state intervention is blatantly hypocritical,” said Posen, but Trump administration officials say they have to borrow from the Chinese playbook to compete. “Advocates in the Trump administration and elsewhere say that an equal response is forced upon the U.S. to cope with this” challenge from China’s state-directed economy, Posen said.

With Trump’s Republican Party embracing a bigger government role in the economy at the expense of the market, what does that mean for future U.S. economic policies? Democrats, including lawmakers such as New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and presidential candidates such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, already unabashedly advocate a greater government role to address economic ills.

Posen sees Republicans, even after the era of Trump, returning to their roots—and no, not free trade or a hands-off approach to the economy.

“From the early 19th century until Reagan, the Republican Party was more protectionist than not,” he said. The current electoral shift toward more rural voters skeptical of globalization and free trade will likely reinforce that tendency for the state to displace the market.

“I think it is likely to last in the Republican Party for a while,” Posen said.","(3, 'inflation')"

Ignore Russia. If the election were held today, Donald Trump would win – and if America’s economy remains robust he may well win again in 2020, according to Wall Street.

According to Politico, a basket of Wall Street’s finest eggheads have concluded that economics is the final arbiter of election victories and, if current trends continue, odds are Trump will romp home in 2020.

“The economy is just so damn strong right now and by all historic precedent the incumbent should run away with it,” Donald Luskin, chief investment officer of TrendMacrolytics, told Politico. “I just don’t see how the blue wall could resist all that.”

TrendMacrolytics correctly predicted Trump’s 2016 win when most opinion polls did not.

The US unemployment rate is currently close to 4%, and the country has added jobs every month for a record 101 months in a row. Wage growth, which has lagged behind jobs growth since the recession, is finally, if slowly, picking up.

US gross domestic product – the widest measure of economic health – is now about 3.4%, up from 1.8% in the first quarter of Trump’s presidency. Trump says he’s truly Making America Great Again.

There are – of course – problems. The White House is predicting the US economy will grow at a rate of 3% or more in each of the coming five years. But most mainstream economists disagree, and the Federal Reserve has stopped raising rates – indicating it believes a slowdown is coming.

And then there is Trump’s popularity problem. Some Wall Street forecasts, in focusing on the economy, ignore political polling, but others, including Moody’s Analytics, believe polls do matter. Trump remains highly favored by Republicans but his numbers with Democrats and independents are appalling and could soon get worse, thanks to Mueller.

Republicans also suffered a major defeat in the midterm elections despite a strong economy. But midterms are often seen as a protest vote. When it comes to the general election – if the economy continues on its current course – the Yale economist Ray Fair, Moody’s chief economist, Mark Zandi, and Luskin all believe Trump would win.

By Fred Backus, Jennifer De Pinto, and Anthony Salvanto

Most Americans remain confident about the U.S. economy and in their own financial situation, and more now give President Trump's policies credit for a strong economy than did so last year.

Seven in 10 Americans say the economy is in good shape, including a quarter who say it is very good. Nearly all Republicans and most Democrats and independents share this view.

Americans increasingly give the president credit for the economy. Forty-one percent of those who say the economy is good say Mr. Trump's policies are mostly responsible, up from 32% at the beginning of 2018. Republicans give the president relatively more credit for the economy than Democrats do.

Forty-one percent of Americans approve of how Mr. Trump is handling his job as president. That is closer to where his rating was last summer than it was in this poll more recently, in January. Approval ratings have remained within a fairly narrow range throughout his presidency so far.

Across particular measures, the economy is the president's strongest: 50% of Americans approve of how he's handling the economy. In contrast, more Americans disapprove of his handling of immigration, foreign policy, and trade with other countries.

Amid congressional Democrats' attempts to investigate the president's finances, 40% of Americans think Mr. Trump has financially profited from his time in the presidency, more so than the 24% who think he has made financial sacrifices in order to serve as president. Another 33% don't think his finances have changed much either way from his being president. But partisans see this differently. Republicans are more apt to feel he has made sacrifices and Democrats more prone to think he has gained financially.

Looking ahead, Americans are more positive about the market than they were a few months ago, despite recent fluctuations. Fifty-six percent now say they are optimistic about the stock market over the next twelve months, up from 49% in January.

There is partisan division about where the economy goes from here. Thirty-seven percent of Americans think the economy is getting better, including 71% of Republicans, but just 11% of Democrats agree.

Looking at their own pocketbooks, most Americans are very or somewhat confident in their own financial situation, but their confidence is related to income. Those earning more express a lot more confidence than those earning less.

Despite the optimism, Americans are wary of a possible trade war with China and its potential impact on the economy. Few think the U.S. will emerge the clear cut winner in any such conflict.

Few think the tariffs on Chinese imports will be good for the U.S. economy in the short term. More think they will make it worse. Republicans are more optimistic than Democrats.

Powell. It’s not that risky a prediction. Trump’s already telegraphing his frustrations with Powell who, Trump apparently feels, increased interest rates too early, slowing economic growth. And for Trump, everything in 2020 comes down to the economy. Setting aside the obvious importance of his aggressive and often toxic proposals on immigration, Trump’s 2016 election was predicated on being the business guy who could right an already mostly righted economy. If he doesn’t have that, what’s the pitch?

The president and his team have so far projected confidence about both the health of the economy and how that health will translate into electoral success. Historically, strong economic numbers have meant positive results for the incumbent president’s party. But then, strong economic numbers have also usually meant not getting blown out in midterm elections and, thanks in large part to Trump’s low approval numbers, that’s exactly what happened in November.

So we can say it like this: A strong economy isn’t a guarantee of victory for Trump, but it’s probably a necessity for Trump to win. And with the economy looking a bit more wobbly these days, that’s an ominous sign for Trump. And probably for Powell.

New Washington Post-ABC News polling released Tuesday suggests that economic uncertainty could lead to political weakness for the president.

There have been a few constants over the course of the past four years. Nonwhite Americans are broadly skeptical of Trump. White Americans are more receptive, with whites who don’t have a college degree — a group that tends to skew older — offering Trump the most robust support.

That has been consistent in approval numbers from Post-ABC polling over the course of Trump’s presidency. Whites with and without college degrees approve of Trump’s job performance at lower rates than they voted for him in 2016 (according to Pew Research Center exit poll analysis), but approval among college-educated whites has been closer to that 2016 vote figure.

(This is admittedly a bit apples-to-oranges, but a comparison to 2016 does give us some sort of benchmark to evaluate how Trump is doing.)

Where things get interesting is when we break out those non-college numbers by gender. The Atlantic’s Ron Brownstein pointed this out: White women without college degrees are much less supportive of Trump now than they were in November 2016. Our new poll has that group 14 percentage points less approving of Trump as president than it was of Trump as a candidate — and indicates that approval of Trump has dropped dramatically since our July poll.

That drop is more significant than the approval drop among college-educated whites and correlates with a more subtle, not-statistically significant drop in the percentage of white women without degrees who view the economy positively. Among college-educated whites, the drop in positive views of the economy was steeper; that group for the first time in our polling views the economy less positively than white men without college degrees.

Notice, too, how views of the economy just before Trump took office (at far left) were similar among white men and white women without college degrees — but over Trump’s presidency, a gap has emerged between those groups.

White women without college degrees now view the economy about the same as Americans overall on net. Within that group, there’s a 17-point gap between those who view the economy positively and those who view it negatively, about the same as the overall 13-point gap. Among nonwhites, the spread goes the other direction: Nonwhites are 13 points more likely to view the economy negatively than positively.

Again, we see that gap between white men without degrees and white women without degrees. That appears in views of how Trump is handling the economy, as well. White men without degrees overwhelmingly approve of how Trump is doing on the economy while white women without degrees are more split. (Overall, less than half of Americans approve of how Trump’s doing on the economy.)

At the big picture level, those data aren’t terrible for Trump. White women without college degrees — a group that made up a quarter of the electorate in 2016, according to Pew, and that backed Trump by 23 points — still are more likely to approve of how Trump’s doing on the economy than not.

Advertisement

Dig into specifics, and the picture gets more grim.

For example, most women in that group think a recession is likely next year — by a 24-point margin. White men without degrees are significantly less pessimistic.

What’s more, more than 4 in 10 of those white women without degrees think Trump’s policies are increasing the risk of there being a recession.

Most white women without degrees disapprove of Trump’s handling of trade negotiations with China.

There’s a wide, noteworthy gulf between the views of white men without degrees and white women without degrees on this point. White men are 30 points more likely to approve of Trump’s handling of the trade war than to disapprove. White women without degrees are 16 points more likely to disapprove.

A similar gap appears on a much more tangible question. Asked whether they are concerned about the trade war increasing prices, two-thirds of white women without degrees say that is a concern. More than half of their male counterparts say they aren’t concerned — the only group of those illustrated below in which a majority isn’t worried about price increases.

It’s tricky to suss out where causality lies here: Are white women without degrees more skeptical of Trump generally and therefore less likely to support his economic arguments, or are economic concerns pushing down support for Trump? This is also one poll; it will be important to track how these views evolve over the course of the 2020 campaign.

Whites without college degrees made up 63 percent of Trump’s votes in 2016, according to Pew’s analysis. If the economy is tamping down enthusiasm among half of that group, that’s an ominous sign for Trump’s reelection.","(0, 'GDP')"

Politically, a lot rides on perceptions of economic performance. Incumbents are almost always reelected amid strong economies. They are frequently defeated amid weak ones.

If Trump really has unleashed “an economic miracle,” that’s a powerful argument for his reelection, and for the Republican Congress that supported him. If the good economic news is a mirage, or if Trump is just riding the Obama administration’s economic policy coattails, then his sole claim to success evaporates. So which is it?

Let’s begin with the data. In July, the economy clocked its 93rd uninterrupted month of job growth — the longest stretch in American history. For the first time on record, there are more open jobs than job seekers. The unemployment rate is 3.9 percent; the last time the unemployment rate was this low was in 2000, the tail end of the Clinton boom.

According to Gallup, 65 percent of Americans believe this is a good time to find a quality job, among the highest readings the pollster has recorded since they began asking the question in 2002.

The cheerful economic news is largely absent from worker paychecks, though. Average hourly wage growth has been 2.7 percent over the past year, anemic given the power and length of the economic expansion. Making matters worse, a surge of inflation, driven by higher oil prices, has clawed back almost all those wage gains, as David Leonhardt documents at the New York Times.

These trends didn’t begin with Trump’s election. This is what the unemployment rate has looked like since 2012. If you can detect a sharp break between the Obama and Trump economies, you’ve got a keener eye than I do:

Looking at job growth yields a similar picture. Depending on which period you’re talking about, you can argue that job growth since Trump was elected has been a bit slower or a bit faster than in the years preceding him, but it’s all clearly within the same trend.

“If you take a look at President Obama’s second term, he was adding 217,000 jobs,” says Betsey Stevenson, an economist at the University of Michigan who served as chief economist at the Labor Department under Barack Obama. “And since Trump assumed the presidency, he’s been adding 189,000 jobs per month. I’d say those are roughly around the same ballpark. But I don’t think Trump should be bragging that he’s somehow doing something that President Obama wasn’t doing.”

The same is true for GDP growth. “Not too long ago, progressive economists said strong economic growth couldn’t be done anymore— that a stagnant U.S. economy was the ‘new normal,’” tweeted House Speaker Paul Ryan. “And yet, our economy is growing at its fastest rate since 2014.”

There is something odd about suggesting you’ve owned the libs and defied the odds by returning to a growth rate last seen during Obama’s second term. At any rate, the Bureau of Economic Analysis offers this chart, which again makes a strong case that we’re basically seeing an economy similar to that of Obama’s second term.

It’s hard to look at this data and argue that the Trump economy represents a sharp break with the Obama economy.

But that argument cuts both directions. Trump hasn’t unleashed an economic miracle, but he hasn’t caused a crisis either. Plenty of liberals believed a Trump victory would be devastating for the economy, tanking stock markets amid fears of trade wars, nuclear wars, and political chaos. That Trump has managed to keep growth going might be a less impressive record than he claims, but it’s a more impressive record than many of his critics expected.

“I’ll give the president credit for not steering the economy into a ditch,” says Aaron Sojourner, a labor economist at the University of Minnesota who closely tracks economic trends. “That’s the main accomplishment. He inherited a strong economy, strong trends, after a campaign of telling us the economy was terrible and awful and we had to make America great again. And now he’s declared victory.”

How Republicans stopped worrying and remembered they love deficits

To the extent that we’ve seen a modest growth bump over the past year, the driving reason might be one Republicans are loath to admit: After years of refusing the Obama administration’s entreaties to lift sequestration and cut taxes for workers, congressional Republicans have joined Trump to boost government spending by hundreds of billions of dollars and pass $1.5 trillion in unpaid tax cuts.

There’s been, in other words, a large, deficit-financed demand-side stimulus of the sort Republicans condemned when Obama asked for it but were all too happy to pass as soon as Trump took office. And after years in which Republicans warned that fear of long-term debt was stopping corporations from investing and the economy from growing, they’ve added trillions to the national credit card without any evident harm to the economy.

“Trump took the Obama economy and added a Keynesian spending boost Republicans never would’ve let Obama do,” says Sojourner.

The disappointment is that more of this money hasn’t shown up in wages. The good news, to the extent that there is good news, is that recent pay raises have been concentrated at the bottom end of the income distribution. Workers in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution are seeing faster real wage growth than they have since the late 1990s, but wages overall are growing more slowly than would be expected for an economy that’s grown this much for this long.

Different economists have different explanations for what’s come to be called “the wage puzzle”; my colleague Matt Yglesias has a great piece on this. But the fact remains that a strong economy hasn’t led to proportionately bigger paychecks. This likely explains why the Trump administration’s tax cuts remain resolutely unpopular: The public heard about trillions of dollars coming down the pike, but they seem to be getting precious little of it.

“What we did was we gave a bunch of money back to people through tax cuts and we didn’t [pay for it],” says Stevenson. “Of course that’s going to provide some sort of short-term stimulus. Now the question is whether that encourages further investment in the economy that creates long-term growth.”

So is this a strong economy? Yes, with some big caveats. Does Trump deserve much of the credit? That’s a harder case to make, but it’s clear that he hasn’t derailed what growth we’ve had, which is an accomplishment of a sort.

The question, now, is whether growth continues. A recession would be devastating, as wage increases haven’t come near to making up for the pain caused by the last recession, and Republicans have taken fiscal firepower that could’ve been held in reserve for a future downturn and spent it on tax cuts and military boosts amid an expansion. It’s a risky strategy for the economy long-term, but it’s one that may boost the GOP’s chances in the next few elections.","(0, 'GDP')"

Two years ago Friday, Republicans in Congress passed a sweeping tax cut. It was supposed to be a gift-wrapped present to taxpayers and the economy. But in hindsight, it looks more like a costly lump of coal.

Passed on a party-line vote, the tax cut is the signature legislative accomplishment of President Trump's first term. He had campaigned hard for the measure, promising it would boost paychecks for working people.

""Our focus is on helping the folks who work in the mailrooms and the machine shops of America,"" he told supporters in the fall of 2017. ""The plumbers, the carpenters, the cops, the teachers, the truck drivers, the pipe-fitters, the people that like me best.""

In fact, more than 60% of the tax savings went to people in the top 20% of the income ladder, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The measure also slashed the corporate tax rate by 40%.

""It will be rocket fuel for our economy,"" Trump promised.

Boosters of the tax cut insisted the economy would grow so fast, it would more than make up for the revenue lost to lower rates.

""The tax plan will pay for itself with economic growth,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.

It hasn't worked out that way.

""It was unbelievable at the time, and it's proven to be absolutely untrue,"" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""The tax cuts were never going to — and have not — come anywhere close to paying for themselves.""

Corporate tax revenues fell 31% in the first year after the cut was passed. Overall tax revenues have declined as a share of the economy in each of the two years since the tax cut took effect.

""Not surprising, if you cut taxes, you get less in revenues,"" MacGuineas said. ""And what we've been doing at the same time is we've been increasing spending. And no surprise, our deficit has exploded.""

The federal deficit this year was $984 billion — an extraordinary figure at a time when the country is not mired in recession or widespread war.

The tax cut also failed to produce a permanent boost in economic growth, despite promises from Republican supporters.

""After eight straight years of slow growth and underperformance, America is ready to take off,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said when the tax cut passed two years ago.

In fact, the economy grew 2.9% last year — exactly the same as in 2015.

The tax cut, along with increased government spending, did give a short-term lift to the economy and businesses temporarily boosted investment. But the rocket fuel burned off quickly. Business investment declined in the last two quarters.

""There was an acceleration in terms of momentum for business investment, but it was rather short-lived,"" said Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics. ""A year further down the road, we're really not seeing much of any leftover of this fiscal stimulus package.""

Hampered in part by the president's trade war, the economy is projected to grow only about 2% this coming year. That's below the administration's target of 3% and slightly below the average growth rate since 2010.

To be sure, the stock market is booming, and unemployment is near record lows. But while most Americans give the economy high marks, that doesn't extend to the tax cut. A Gallup Poll last tax season found only about 40% of Americans approved of the cut while 49% disapproved.

Even though experts say most workers did get a bump in their take-home pay, it was largely invisible to many taxpayers. Only about 14% of those surveyed by Gallup believe their taxes went down. (That figure includes 22% of Republicans, 12% of Democrats and 10% of independents.)

""For millions of middle-class Americans, it is not a very happy anniversary,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.

Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said while wealthy Americans are celebrating their tax savings from the past two years, working people feel like an afterthought.

Perhaps it's an acknowledgement of that sentiment that the president is now talking about another round of tax cuts, after the 2020 election. ""We're going to be doing a major middle-income tax cut, if we take back the House,"" Trump promised in November.

The president made similar promises before last year's midterm election. But the follow-up to his 2017 tax cut never materialized.","(4, 'national debt')"

Story Highlights Economic Confidence Index climbs 13 points

Index positive for the first time since March 2015

Republicans' economic outlook improves drastically

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Americans' confidence in the U.S. economy increased sharply after the election, moving from a slightly negative evaluation (-10) to a slightly positive one (+3). Gallup's U.S. Economic Confidence Index had been consistently negative throughout the year leading up to the election.

Gallup's U.S. Economic Confidence Index, Before and After the Election Nov 1-7 , 2016 Nov 9-13 , 2016 -10 +3 Gallup Daily Tracking

Gallup's U.S. Economic Confidence Index is the average of two components: how Americans rate current economic conditions and whether they feel the economy is improving or getting worse. The index has a theoretical maximum of +100 if all Americans were to say the economy is doing well and improving, and a theoretical minimum of -100 if all Americans were to say the economy is doing poorly and getting worse.

The index has registered positive only a handful of times over the nine years Gallup has tracked it daily -- the most recent being March 2015. For the week of Nov. 7-13, including two pre-election and five post-election days of interviewing, the index averaged 0.

The increase in economic confidence mostly stems from Republicans' more positive views after Republican Donald Trump won the election. Gallup has previously noted that Americans view the economy through a political lens. Republicans have had a dismal view of the economy -- especially of its future direction -- during Democratic President Barack Obama's two terms.

Republicans' Economic Outlook Improves Substantially

After Trump won last week's election, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents now have a much more optimistic view of the U.S. economy's outlook than they did before the election. Just 16% of Republicans said the economy was getting better in the week before the election, while 81% said it was getting worse. Since the election, 49% say it is getting better and 44% worse.

Conversely, Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents' confidence in the economy plummeted after the election. Before the election, 61% of Democrats said the economy was getting better and 35% worse. Now, Democrats are evenly divided, with 46% saying it is getting better and 47% saying it is getting worse.

Perceptions of Whether Economy Is Getting Better or Worse by Political Party, Before and After the 2016 Presidential Election Republicans, pre-election (Nov 1-7 ) Republicans, post-election (Nov 9-13 ) Democrats, pre-election (Nov 1-7 ) Democrats, post-election (Nov 9-13 ) % Getting better 16 49 61 46 % Getting worse 81 44 35 47 Index (% better minus % worse) -65 +5 +26 -1 Party groups include independents who lean to the party Gallup Daily tracking

Republicans Less Negative About Current Economic Conditions

In addition to being more optimistic about the economy's future than they were before the election, Republicans are also slightly less negative about where economic conditions currently stand -- likely because they will have a Republican president in the near future. However, they remain negative overall about the current state of the economy under the incumbent Democratic president. It is likely that their view of current economic conditions will further improve, possibly into positive territory, when Trump takes office in January.

Republicans' current conditions component score has increased to -5, up significantly from -21 before the election. The latest score is the result of 21% of Republicans saying the economy is ""excellent"" or ""good,"" and 26% saying it is ""poor.""

Democrats, on the other hand, have become more negative in their views of the current state of the U.S. economy, but the change is smaller among this group. Democrats' component score fell to +17 after the election, compared with +26 beforehand.

Bottom Line

The election of Trump has transformed the way Republicans and Democrats view the economy, particularly in their assessments of whether it is getting better or worse. But given the political and economic tumult of the past week, measures of the index in the coming weeks may be more indicative of U.S. economic confidence in the year ahead. On the one hand, global markets trembled on election night as Trump's victory became clearer. On the other hand, U.S. markets rallied later in the week, with the Dow Jones industrial average reaching a new high on Monday.

It's too early to say whether these are sustainable gains in confidence. But in the immediate future, Trump's victory has improved his party's confidence in the economy. Barring any major events, it is likely that Republicans will shift to a positive index score once the incoming president takes office, while Democrats' confidence will take a hit.

These data are available in Gallup Analytics.

Survey Methods

Results for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted Nov. 9-13, 2016, on the Gallup U.S. Daily survey, with a random sample of 2,532 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. For results based on the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. All reported margins of sampling error include computed design effects for weighting.

Each sample of national adults includes a minimum quota of 60% cellphone respondents and 40% landline respondents, with additional minimum quotas by time zone within region. Landline and cellular telephone numbers are selected using random-digit-dial methods.

To pick one indicator, in May 2018 the unemployment rate reached 3.8%, the lowest value in two decades. President Trump, in office for one and a half years, does not hesitate to claim credit for these developments. He asserts in characteristic hyperbole:

“We’ve got the greatest economy, maybe, ever — maybe in history. We have the greatest economy we’ve ever had…. If we didn’t win, this economy would be a wreck.” (Trump 2018)

A recent White House release argues that because of the ‘pro-growth agenda’ of President Trump “the economy has created nearly 3 million jobs” (The White House 2018). But to what extent does President Trump really deserve credit for the booming economy?

To answer this question, we must not simply look at the performance of the US economy. Instead, we need to understand how the US economy would have developed in the absence of President Trump, such that we can compare the actual performance to a counterfactual ‘no-Trump’ scenario. Finding such an appropriate counterfactual for the US economy requires a careful statistical analysis. We perform such an analysis in a new paper (Born et al. 2018a).

Finding a counterfactual

A simple approach would be to pick another country that seems relatively similar in terms of its economic structure, and then use it as a benchmark. For instance, one could compare the performance of the US economy since 2017 to other advanced economies such as Canada or the EU. However, this is unsatisfactory for various reasons. How can we know which countries to compare to?

Our approach is to let the data speak for itself. We let an algorithm determine which combination of other economies matches the evolution of real GDP in the US beforethe 2016 election with the highest possible accuracy. For this purpose we rely on a large data set of 30 other OECD economies and observations from 1995Q1 up to 2016Q3. Assuming we find a good match, we can then compare the evolution of the US economy since the election of Trump to its doppelganger that did not get the ‘treatment’ of electing Trump.

This so-called synthetic control method goes back to Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) and has been successfully applied to study the effects of similar one-off events such as German reunification, or the introduction of tobacco laws in the US (Abadie et al. 2010, 2015). We also use it in a recent study that identifies the economic costs of the Brexit vote (Born et al. 2018b).

It is important to stress that the economies picked by the algorithm and the weight they are assigned is entirely data-driven and open to replication by other researchers. The better the algorithm constructs a close economic doppelganger for the US economy as a weighted combination of other OECD economies, the more accurate our results will be. For the US, the matching algorithm attributes high weights to Canada and the UK, but also to Denmark and Norway (for details, see Born et al. 2018a).

Zero impact: President Trump and US growth

Figure 1 shows our measure of GDP for the doppelganger (in red) and the US (in blue). Before the presidential election in November 2016, the evolution of real GDP is very similar in the US and in the doppelganger. The doppelganger is constructed in order to match the time path of US GDP, but there are more observations than free parameters (30 country weights) so the fact that the doppelganger tracks actual real GDP so closely is noteworthy. Moreover, the doppelganger does not only exhibit the same trend growth, but the cyclical fluctuations are also similar. For instance, the doppelganger had a similar output drop in the Great Recession.

Figure 1 GDP (index) in the US versus doppelganger

Note: Dashed lines are forecasts. Shaded area corresponds to one standard deviation of the pre-treatment difference between US and doppelganger.

Does the US economy outperform its doppelganger after the election of Trump? Recall that the doppelganger represents a natural counterfactual for how the US economy would have evolved without the election of Trump. In Figure 1 the Trump vote is indicated by the vertical line. The main result can be easily spotted visually – there is no acceleration of the US economy relative to the doppelganger. If anything, the doppelganger outperforms initially and by mid-2018 there is no discernible difference.

It is important to stress that the doppelganger has been constructed exclusively on the basis of observations prior to the vote. And yet, the doppelganger tracks the behaviour of the US economy very closely after the vote as well. This means that the US economy behaves just as it did before the election. Trump, in other words, was immaterial for US growth. The doppelganger grew just as fast.

This result stands in contrast to the substantial effects that the synthetic control method helps uncover in other situations. For instance, in our analysis of the Brexit vote we find a large and significant effect on UK GDP. In the seven quarters after the referendum, UK GDP declined relative to its doppelganger by close to 2% (Born et al. 2018b).

Figure 2 Employment (index) in the US versus doppleganger

Note: Dashed lines are forecasts. Shaded area corresponds to one standard deviation of the pre-treatment difference between US and doppelganger.

Figure 2 reinforces this message. Here, we replace GDP with total civilian employment and test if the US economy has created more jobs under Trump than its doppelganger. The focus on employment appears natural in light of many remarks and tweets about the employment situation emanating from the White House. Figure 2 exposes most of this as ‘fake news’. The employment performance of the US economy since the election was no different from its doppelganger. There is nothing in the data that indicates an acceleration of employment creation because of President Trump.

Conclusions

The impact of President Trump on the macroeconomic performance of the US economy has been negligible so far. We measure neither an acceleration of growth nor increased job creation in the US economy relative to an appropriate benchmark.

A potential concern could be that the US is so well-integrated into the global economy that its policies are also felt across the globe. It could be, in other words, that Trump’s policies lifted all boats so that we don’t find a differential effect. However, it is unlikely for various reasons that the missing ‘Trump effect’ is simply the result of spillovers from Trump’s policies to the rest of the world. This is because many of the policies implemented by the Trump administration had a domestic focus, such as financial deregulation or tax reforms.

We leave a more detailed analysis of the individual policy measures for future research. At this point we are confident in concluding that President Trump largely inherited the ‘greatest economy ever’. That said, we also note that there is no evidence to date that President Trump caused a deterioration of macroeconomic performance in the US – he is a stable genius indeed.

The Appalachian state is, along with Delaware, just one of two states where poverty rose last year, bucking the national trend of growing incomes and declining hardship, according to U.S. Census data released earlier this month. West Virginia's poverty rate climbed to 19.1 percent last year from 17.9 percent, making it just one of four states with a poverty rate above 18 percent.

President Donald Trump plans to visit West Virginia on Saturday, when he's expected to tout his economic accomplishments. The president has said he's ""very proud"" of the state and claimed that he ""turned West Virginia around."" His administration has focused on reviving jobs in the coal industry, which has added about 2,000 jobs across the U.S. since Mr. Trump's inauguration.

Mr. Trump has boasted about the state's GDP growth, but its economy grew by 1.3 percent in the first quarter, or 37th in the nation and lagging the national rate of 1.8 percent, according to government data. It had fared better in 2017: up 2.6 percent for the year, tenth among the 50 states, compared with 2.1 percent for the nation.

Coal ""is a potent message,"" but it overlooks the reality of West Virginia's economy, said Sean O'Leary, senior policy analyst of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, a nonpartisan think tank. ""The growth we've had is in low-wage industries. Folks who find jobs haven't found jobs that keep them out of poverty.""

President Trump acknowledges the crowd at a Make America Great Again rally in Charleston, West Virginia, on Aug. 21, 2018. Reuters

Jobs in low-wage industries have grown 14.5 percent since 2001 in West Virginia, compared with a decline of 2.8 percent in jobs that pay higher wages during the same time, according to the WVCBP's figures. The state has about 22,000 people employed in mining and logging, compared with 131,000 education and health care workers and 155,000 government workers, two of the biggest industries in the state, according to government data.

West Virginia's dismal trends point to an economic issue that's impacting states across the country: Workers at the bottom of the pay scale aren't benefiting from the growing economy. Their issues range from low pay to unstable and scanty work hours, which makes it difficult to earn a living wage. Almost one in four West Virginians is employed in a low-wage job, the WVCBP found.

""It's cashiers, retail sales people, service employees -- those are our fastest growing jobs, but those jobs don't pay very well,"" O'Leary notes.

At the Manna Meals soup kitchen, more people are coming in for nourishment, said its executive director, Tara Martinez. The Charleston soup kitchen served almost 10,800 meals in August, compared with about 9,700 in January.

""There's a direct correlation between the hopelessness and the lack of jobs,"" she said. ""The jobs that are available are minimum wage and part time -- they don't have benefits. When you have that, coupled with the hopelessness of, 'How do I get out of this cycle?' and having to go to a soup pantry, it's like a hamster wheel.""

The opioid crisis is another issue facing West Virginia, which Martinez said she believes is tied to low-wage jobs and a lack of opportunity. Her observations echo academic findings from Princeton economists Anne Case and Nobel Prize-winner Angus Deaton, who found rising mortality rates for less educated white adults in the U.S., which they called ""deaths of despair.""

And West Virginia plays directly into the issues highlighted by Deaton and Case. The state, whose population is 95 percent white, is frequently listed as one of the least educated states in the country.

About 21 percent of West Virginians between ages 25 to 64 has a college degree, according to the National Information Center for Higher Education Policymaking and Analysis. At the national level, about one-third of American workers have a college degree.

The post-recession economy has favored Americans with college degrees, providing them with both growing incomes and professional opportunities. But many who lack that credential have been left out of the recovery, as evidenced in West Virginia.

""People who don't have jobs or don't have any way out of this cycle, there's a hopelessness that overtakes them,"" Martinez said.

To be sure, West Virginia is coping with other hurdles in its battle against poverty, such as an aging population, higher rates of disability, and a small workforce compared with bigger states, such as New York or California. The state's small size -- just 1.8 million people last year, down 50,000 from 2010 -- means it's harder to lure employers to the state, O'Leary noted.

West Virginia had a net job loss of 26,000 from early 2012 to late 2016, according to a study from West Virginia University. And the state has the lowest labor force participation rate of all 50 states, at 53 percent.

Employment is growing slowly at a projected 0.7 percent per year through 2022, or below the national growth rate of 0.9 percent. At that rate, local employment isn't expected to reach its 2012 peak until 2021, the study found.

West Virginia's poor residents will face another burden beginning in October, when work requirements for food stamps go into effect across the state. Martinez said she believes the measure, which requires able-bodied adults without dependents to work, volunteer or receive job training for at least 20 hours a week to receive food stamps, will push more into poverty and ramp up demand for her soup kitchen's services.

""It's frightening and I'm worried and I'm doing everything I can to make sure our doors are still open,"" she said, noting that she expects demand for meals to rise by 30 percent. ""It's going to be a lot of fundraising and pleading.""

She added, ""You have huge companies, corporations that do really well and make a substantial profit and paying their employees as little as possible -- and their employees are on food stamps or other benefits.""","(0, 'GDP')"

He tweeted late Monday that “In many ways this is the greatest economy in the HISTORY of America and the best time EVER to look for a job!” He followed that up Tuesday with a tweet saying the current conditions could be “the best economy in the history of our country.”

Trump did hedge, but if he’s suggesting his economy is the best ever, he’s got a problem: The numbers don’t back him up.

This is a good economy and Trump deserves some credit for it. But calling it the “greatest ever” goes too far, as it can’t top the late 1990s or the stellar growth in parts of the 1940s, 1960s and 1980s, according to key data.

There are many ways to judge an economy, but the typical measures are growth, jobs, wages, inflation and debt. Inequality also usually gets tossed into the mix.

In today’s economy, jobs are plentiful, the stock market is at record levels and confidence — both business and consumer — is high. Inflation has also remained tame. But growth, while showing signs of picking up, is still below what it was in many eras. Wage growth is also disappointing compared with what it was in prior boom times, and the deficit has also surged, which experts warn could be a drag on the economy for yeas to come.

Let’s break down the good, the so-so and the not great parts of the current economy. (And let’s add the caveat that presidents usually get more credit for good or bad economic times than they probably deserve.)

The really good: America has a lot of jobs right now

The United States has a record number of job openings and the unemployment rate is the lowest it has been since April 2000. If it falls any lower (and most economists say it will), Trump would be presiding over the lowest rate since 1969 (when unemployment fell to 3.5 percent).

Unemployment is at the lowest level for African Americans since the government started measuring it in 1972, and the gap between black and white unemployment rates is the narrowest ever. Hispanic unemployment is near an all-time low, as is unemployment for Americans who have high school diplomas but didn’t attend college.

Neil Irwin of the New York Times put it this way: “We ran out of words to describe how good the jobs numbers are.” Kevin Hassett, head of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers, said Tuesday, “The job market right now is about as strong as I’ve ever seen.”

While hiring has been strong for years and the trend began under President Barack Obama, 2018 has looked especially good. The monthly average job gains this year are actually faster than last year or 2016. Trump deserves some credit for that, and business leaders such as JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon say the tax cuts and deregulation under Trump have boosted their profits and spurred many companies to hire more workers.

The only drawback is that a smaller share of Americans are working now than in 2000. The labor force participation rate — a measure of the total number of people working against the total number of people who could be working — is under 63 percent now, vs. 67 percent in 2000. While some of the decline is explained by baby boomers retiring, not all of it is, raising concerns that some Americans who could work still aren't.

The good (but not great): Economic growth is picking up (but still below the 1990s)

On the campaign trail, Trump liked to call the Obama economy “weak” and “anemic.” He often pointed to 2 percent economic growth as puny and said he could achieve growth of 4 or 5 percent a year. Yet under Trump so far, the economy isn’t growing much faster than it did under Obama. In his first year in office, economy grew by 2.3 percent. It’s possible to argue that Trump’s policies had not taken effect, but the economy grew by just 2.2 percent in the first quarter of this year.

Growth is expected to pick up during the rest of 2018. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that growth will be at 3.3 percent for the year, the best since 2005, and Trump deserves some credit for that, although a global rebound has also helped. But almost no forecaster thinks that level of growth will last; most expect it to fall back down quickly.

To put it another way, growth in the Trump era looks likely to be far short of the late 1990s or 1980s, when growth averaged above 4 percent a year or much of the 1960s when growth averaged above 5 percent a year.

The disappointing: Wage growth is still lousy.

Trump has tapped into the frustration and insecurities of many American workers whose pay has been basically flat for the past two decades — or more. Once you adjust for inflation (a.k.a. cost of living), median household income in America was several thousand dollars lower in 2014 than in 2000. It has improved a tad — 2016 was the highest middle-class income on record, but it’s still barely topped the level from 1999.

The problem for Trump is that it’s not getting much better. Wage growth is still hovering around 2.6 to 2.8 percent, which is barely above inflation. That's far short of the 4 percent wage growth during much of the 1990s.

There’s optimism that Americans will finally get wage growth over 3 percent later this year. There are many signs that companies can’t find enough workers and are finally willing to pay more to get (and keep) employees. But while there are many anecdotes of companies saying they are raising pay, the official wage growth statistic for the entire country still isn’t rising much.

After Trump’s tax cuts, some companies opted to give one-time bonuses. That’s real money for employees, but it only comes once and isn’t a true wage bump.

The really disappointing: Trump’s $1 trillion deficits

As a candidate, Trump once promised to eliminate the national debt within 8 years. But projected deficits have exploded on his watch.

America’s annual government budget deficit will hit $1 trillion by 2020, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and it’s expected to stay that high for years to come. It’s mainly driven by the tax cut Trump pushed hard for and signed in December. His team started off wanting to make it “deficit-neutral” so it would not add to the debt, but that was quickly abandoned. The end result is a tax cut that CBO estimates will add $1.9 trillion to the debt because of lost revenue and added interest costs.

On top of that, Trump pushed for more government spending, especially on the military, and he has refused to make any changes to Medicare or Social Security, the two programs that many budget hawks say must be tweaked in the coming years or else the debt will become unsustainable. He has also sought cuts to safety net programs for the poor, which could exacerbate inequality.

While debt has grown under many recent presidents, it happened during sour economic times when the government tried to spend to revive the economy and save jobs. It’s highly unusual to have this kind of buildup of debt during good economic times, and many have warned the economy could suffer down the road as the U.S. government lacks the money to help during the next downturn, let alone make needed investments in infrastructure and education.

Bottom line: Most economists call this a very solid time for the U.S. economy. Some even call it “hot” or “strong.” But they aren’t calling it history-making.","(0, 'GDP')"

Trump tweeted: “Highest Stock Market EVER, best economic numbers in years, unemployment lowest in 17 years, wages raising, border secure, S.C.: No WH chaos!”, encouraging the world to put aside the unfolding Russia scandal, impotence over North Korean missile launches and the sacking of newly arrived press secretary Anthony “the Mooch” Scaramucci, and look instead at the economic boom apparently unfolding under the president’s administration.

Highest Stock Market EVER, best economic numbers in years, unemployment lowest in 17 years, wages raising, border secure, S.C.: No WH chaos! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 31, 2017

A little while later he followed up his summary of economic news by tweeting a quote from Fox News morning anchor Stuart Varney that said: “Corporations have NEVER made as much money as they are making now”.

""Corporations have NEVER made as much money as they are making now."" Thank you Stuart Varney @foxandfriends Jobs are starting to roar,watch! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2017

As a final riposte to critics, he added: “Stock Market could hit all-time high (again) 22,000 today. Was 18,000 only 6 months ago on Election Day. Mainstream media seldom mentions!”

Stock Market could hit all-time high (again) 22,000 today. Was 18,000 only 6 months ago on Election Day. Mainstream media seldom mentions! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 1, 2017

His message is clear. Whatever is going on in the White House, the folks on Main Street and Wall Street are back in business and making money, which raises the question: is the US economy really booming and how much credit can Trump take for it?

‘Highest stock market EVER…’

The Dow Jones Industrial Average powered through 22000 last week to hit another record high. The broader measure of US companies, the S&P 500, continued its ascent back to a high point established in June.

Wall Street analysts expect the US stock market, which has soared by more than a fifth since Trump took office, to maintain its supercharged rise for some time yet.

But not much of the boost can be credited to the president. There was an initial spike following his election as infrastructure companies boomed on hopes of big government spending contracts, and wealthy investors and corporations gambled that he would hand out eye-watering tax cuts.

But more important has been the action of the Federal Reserve, the US central bank. This year, despite two small rate rises, the signs are that a return to anything like normal interest rates is a long way off. Falling inflation means that the pressure is off for the Fed to act and a slower pace of increases is now likely.

Stocks are not the only assets affected. Foreign exchange traders watch the same signals and since January have decided that rate rises, which act to suck foreign money into the US, are not going to happen. They sold the dollar, which has fallen by around 10% against a basket of currencies since January.

One major spin-off of that decline has been a boost to exports, especially to China, despite Trump’s anti-Beijing rhetoric. That’s good news for companies from Apple to General Electric.

Another trend is the spectacular revenues of most large companies. Firms have continued to spend their improving profit levels on share buybacks. This policy means companies spend their own cash to reduce the number of shares in circulation, pushing up their value on the stock market.

Verdict Yes, the stock market is up – but mostly in response to signals of a slower withdrawal of cheap credit by the Federal Reserve.

‘Best economic numbers…’

Trump is excited about the economy and his tweets are mostly in response to the improvement in GDP growth seen during the second quarter, to an annualised rate of 2.6%.

Surveys of the manufacturing and services sector for July and the latest monthly labour market data illustrate the buoyant state of the economy, with all three expanding.

But most indicators show consumer spending is losing its power and that eight years of vigorous expansion is drawing to its conclusion.

Figures from the Federal Housing Finance Agency show that annual house price rises have almost halved from 6% last year to 3.2% in the first half of 2017.

Retail sales have followed the same path. Strong growth in 2016 has petered out this year, with May and June recording significant declines amid falling demand for trucks, cars and discretionary items.

Robert J Shapiro, a former economic adviser to Bill Clinton, says: “This expansion is getting old. The growth rate is half what we saw in the 1990s and there are strong indications that the economy will weaken next year.”

Shapiro, who runs his own economic consultancy, Sonecon, in Washington, believes few people will permit Trump to take credit for the current benign economic situation – but will hold him responsible should it deteriorate by the midterm elections in November 2018.

“We always give credit for the economy in the first year to the previous president,” he says. “Trump hasn’t passed any significant legislation, and while he has put forward some de-regulation measures, they haven’t had any effect yet.”

Trump’s Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, argues that his budget proposals for the autumn will extend the current run of strong growth and push it to beyond 3% year after year through to the middle of the next decade, at which point bumper tax receipts will bring the government spending deficit back into balance.

The budget is a mix of tax cuts for the richest and middle-income groups coupled with deep cuts in further education and welfare spending.

Albert Edwards, the famously gloomy global strategist at Société Générale, is convinced that the loose monetary policies preferred by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, and endorsed by Trump, are encouraging a debt bubble that will burst with similar consequences to the 2008 financial crash.

Edwards said in a recent note to investors: “I’m genuinely getting tired of bashing the major central banks, but every day more evidence mounts that almost exactly the same debt excesses that caused the global financial crisis in 2008 are present today.

“The Bank of England and Federal Reserve deserve particular vilification for failing to remove the monetary punchbowl quickly enough – just like the 2003-2007 period, allowing grotesque debt excesses to build.”

Mnuchin’s budget is expected to be watered down as it makes its way through Congress and emerge as not much more than a mild tax cut for the wealthy. That would leave the Fed unmoved and sticking to its course of only incremental interest rate rises over a period of years.

Verdict The best years of the current recovery are in the past, though unfunded tax cuts in the autumn could provide a sugar rush that pushes up growth and inflation next year.

‘Unemployment lowest…’

Economists have worried that the US economy is struggling to create significant employment despite Trump’s promise of “JOBS! JOBS! JOBS!”

July marked the 82nd consecutive month of jobs growth in the US, but, just as in the UK, the recovery from the depths of the 2008 recession has been marked by slow wage growth and a worryingly large number of people in part-time work. Huge numbers of women and older workers have quit the jobs market completely. America now has one of the lowest labour market participation rates in the developed world.

Jobs data has emphasised the trend, with the largest growth in low-paying service industry jobs, and not in the higher-paying traditional blue-collar industries Trump pledged to support.

Coal exports have boomed this year, but jobs in food services are growing at more than three times the rate of mining jobs, and manufacturing employment growth is static.

Shapiro says he advised Hillary Clinton before last November’s presidential election that she would need to put in place policies that raised the skill levels of blue-collar workers to prepare them for workplaces increasingly dominated by technology.

“You have already hit full employment so you can’t expect strong job expansion to support growth,” he says. “And without strong jobs growth you need to increase productivity, but that has been slow for three years and shows no sign of increasing.

“This is a White House that has largely been absorbed by the Russia scandal and the legal implications for senior members of the administration. It is not a White House with many eyes on the economy. For one thing there haven’t been any economists appointed yet. In the Treasury it’s just Secretary Mnuchin and that’s it.”

Verdict Well-paid blue-collar jobs remain hard to find, despite rising employment.

‘Wages rising…’

For much of the last decade, economists have expected a return to wage rises of 4% that dramatically lift consumer spending and feed into rising prices. It’s the trigger the Fed is looking for to raise interest rates more than the one percentage point it has managed in the last 20 months.

Wages once again grew only marginally in June, rising 2.5% from a year ago and little changed from prior months. Adjusted for inflation, “real” wage growth is close to 1%.

Adam Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says the labour market is looking mildly confusing at the moment after years of rising employment and low wages growth.

“The workforce is only growing at 0.5% and productivity’s at 1%. Even if productivity is raised to 1.5% you still don’t get near Mnuchin’s 3-4% wages growth targets,” says Posen, who has worked in central banks on both sides of the Atlantic – at the New York Fed and on the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee.

He and Shapiro agree that there is little in Trump’s programme that will increase productivity.

Greg Daco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, says employers have coped with an ageing population by employing migrants, leaving much of Trump’s agenda as “anti-growth”.

He says: “The economy is doing OK, but not great. And the high hopes business had for Trump’s initiatives have turned negative because, if anything, the president’s time in office is characterised by protectionism, anti-immigration and lingering policy uncertainty.”

Daco has pencilled in growth averaging just 1.5% over the next 10 years.

Verdict Wage rises are showing no signs of picking up. The only silver lining is that paralysis on Capitol Hill will mean that inflation stays low and real wages stay positive.

‘NEVER made as much money…’

Kathleen Brooks, research director at spread-betting firm City Index, says that with 350 out of the 500 companies on the S&P 500 having reported earnings for the second quarter, it is clear that “virtually every sector exceeded expectations for earnings and sales”.

Domestic sales on average have remained solid as consumers shrug off the uncertainty created by legislative chaos in Washington.

The biggest boost has comes from exports, which rose modestly last month to $192bn – the highest since April 2015 – on rising shipments of cars and consumer goods, including mobile phones. Imports fell slightly.

Importantly, the deficit in the trade of goods with China fell by 6.2% to a seasonally adjusted $30.1bn.

Trump is credited with a boom in coal exports and a commitment from companies like Apple to bring back factories to the US when they invest in their next generation of phones. Apple’s profits, along with those of most tech firms, were among the highlights of the recent reporting season.

But the main reason for these numbers are improving global trade links, after a recovery from lows seen in 2015. While Trump may appear to be a huge political risk to smooth trade flows, the situation at the moment is calm and supporting improved global growth.

Trump could have his moment to boast as a result of his upcoming budget, which promises a huge cut in corporation tax from 35% – one of the highest headline rates in the G20. Scepticism that a cut can be agreed in Congress is rife, not least because Barack Obama was unable to push through similar reductions.

Nevertheless, just the prospect of budget handouts has lifted the spirits of average Americans. Unlike in the UK, where consumer confidence has fallen back to levels seen in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, Americans last week started feeling much more confident about the economy, pushing the Bloomberg consumer comfort index to a seven-week high.

The rising stock market, rather than anything Trump said or did, was credited with the confidence boost, especially among those earning more than $75,000.

Daco says he is concerned that after several years when consumers spent within their means, the income and spending trends started diverging last year. He blames a greater reliance on credit, especially to buy cars, and a “savings dip” that has seen consumers run down deposits to fund spending.

The latest data shows the personal savings rate at 3.8% – much lower than the pre-revision level of around 5% and down about 2 percentage points since the start of 2016.

Trump was having none of it on Friday, retweeting his fans. One said: “Republican Senators who are opposing the President, look at the great economic news: Americans Are Noticing!”

Verdict One of the few certainties is that corporations and wealthy company bosses will prosper under a Trump presidency.","(5, 'stock market')"

For many ordinary Iranians, it's becoming increasingly hard to get by.

US President Donald Trump has slapped fresh sanctions on Iran as part of his ""maximum pressure"" campaign against the Middle Eastern nation. Trump's executive order on Monday targeted none other than Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and his associates, with financial sanctions.

US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Trump's order will lock up billions of additional dollars in Iranian assets.

Tehran and Washington are currently locked in a bitter standoff, and escalating tensions have fueled fears of an unintended slide toward a military confrontation between the two sides, particularly after Iran shot down a US spy drone over the Persian Gulf last week.

The US has also beefed up its military presence in the region and blacklisted Iran's Revolutionary Guards as a ""foreign terrorist organization."" In response, Iran declared the US a ""state sponsor of terrorism"" and American forces in the Middle East and beyond as ""terrorist groups.""

Last year, Trump unilaterally pulled the US out of the landmark nuclear deal that Iran and six world powers struck in 2015. He has since reimposed wide-ranging sanctions, aimed at putting an end to Iran's oil exports, crippling its main source of foreign exchange and forcing Tehran to abandon its nuclear ambitions.

How have US sanctions hit Iran?

The US moves have hit the Iranian economy hard. While the oil-rich nation's crude exports have been down, inflation and unemployment have risen drastically.

Iran, which sits on the world's fourth-largest oil reserves and second-biggest gas reserves, shipped over 2.5 million barrels per day of crude in April 2018, the month before Trump withdrew the US from the nuclear deal. That figure was down to about 400,000 to 500,000 barrels per day in May, reported Reuters news agency, citing industry sources.

The lifting of international sanctions in 2016 spurred rapid growth in Iran, with the country's economy expanding by more than 12% in 2016. But the reimposition of sanctions last year dealt a massive blow. The Iranian economy, the second-largest in the region behind Saudi Arabia's, shrunk by 3.9% last year, estimated the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

In 2019, IMF forecasts say, Iran's economy will shrink by a massive 6%.

Frustration over the sanctions is running high among Iranians, who have seen the value of Iran's currency, the rial, plummet by about 60% over the past year. Inflation is up to 37% and the cost of food and medicine has soared by 40% to 60%, according to EU figures.

""In the last weeks and months, the prices of daily products have increased dramatically for every Iranian,"" Michael Tockuss, managing director of the German-Iranian Chamber of Commerce, told DW. ""The sanctions are not specific anymore; they're not directed against special companies or against the rulers of the country. Instead, they hit average Iranians all over the country.""

What's the effect on unemployment?

Many foreign companies, including carmakers like Daimler and Peugeot and oil group Total, have wound up their operations in Iran in recent months. This has driven up the jobless rate in the country, with overall unemployment currently hovering around 12%.

Iran's young people are bearing the brunt of unemployment even more. The youth unemployment rate is close to 30% in a country where almost 40% of the 80 million people are under 25.

A parliamentary report last September warned that rising unemployment could threaten the country's stability. The report also said that if Iran's economic growth remained below 5% in the coming years, unemployment could hit 26%.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says his country is facing ""economic war."" But Washington stresses that economic pressures on Tehran are directed at the government, not at the Iranian people.

In May, Iran said it would begin backing away from the nuclear accord's terms, setting a July 7 deadline for the deal's remaining signatories — the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China — to negotiate new terms or it would resume enriching uranium closer to weapons-grade levels.

Observers say that should Iran follow through on enriching uranium beyond the permitted levels, the nuclear deal could collapse entirely. In that case, UN sanctions would also be reimposed, a move that could devastate the already crisis-hit economy.

Can Europe help?

Following Trump's withdrawal from the nuclear deal, Germany, France and the UK set up a special payment channel called INSTEX to circumvent US sanctions and continue trade with Iran. The European move came despite the Trump administration warning against initiatives to sidestep the sanctions on Iran.

The mechanism was set up in January, but it has so far failed to deliver. While the payment channel would theoretically shield European companies from US sanctions-related penalties, many businesses have been reluctant to trade with Iran due to concerns they could find themselves on the wrong side of US law and risk losing access to the American market.

The failure has caused disappointment in Iran. Iran's supreme leader, Khamenei, even dismissed INSTEX as a ""bitter joke.""

""Practically, at the moment, this system plays no role,"" said Tockuss.

Holly Dagres, nonresident fellow at the Washington-based Atlantic Council, told DW in May that the EU's options were limited when it came to preserving the nuclear deal and trading with Iran.

""The reality is that Europe is limited in terms of telling its companies to go and do business in Iran. There is this greater fear that they will be sanctioned,"" said Dagres.","(4, 'national debt')"
396,Trump and the Economy - Foreign Affairs Magazine,Trump and the Economy  Foreign Affairs Magazine,"Mon, 13 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmVpZ25hZmZhaXJzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy91bml0ZWQtc3RhdGVzLzIwMTctMDItMTMvdHJ1bXAtYW5kLWVjb25vbXnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Foreign Affairs Magazine,"The central economic goal of Donald Trump’s administration will be to boost U.S. economic growth. Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s nominee for treasury secretary, has said that the administration’s objective is to raise the rate of GDP growth to three to four percent, doubling the rate achieved over the last decade. This will be accomplished by establishing a globally competitive corporate tax rate, adopting a territorial corporate tax system, reducing excessive regulation, boosting domestic energy production, and introducing better trade policies.

The United States has the highest corporate tax rate of any country in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. At 35 percent, the U.S. rate far exceeds the rates of the United Kingdom (20 percent), Germany (16 percent), Canada (15 percent), Ireland (13 percent), and many other countries. This high rate discourages investment, and reducing it will encourage it. The Trump administration plans to lower the corporate rate to 15 percent, eliminating the disadvantage for U.S. companies, making the United States a more attractive destination for investment, and creating jobs for American workers.

In addition to a high domestic corporate tax rate, the United States also imposes a 35 percent tax on repatriated foreign earnings (with a credit for any foreign taxes paid). This has led U.S. companies to locate their manufacturing operations abroad and to keep their foreign earnings abroad, as well, rather than bring them back to the United States. Few other countries have such a policy, and it is one reason why U.S. companies have parked an estimated $2.5 trillion overseas.

This unfavorable tax structure, moreover, has caused many U.S. companies to behave oddly. Apple, for instance, borrows money in the United States, even though it has over $200 billion in cash reserves abroad (kept there in order to avoid paying the taxes that repatriation would generate). The chip maker Qualcomm recently announced a $39 billion acquisition of the Dutch company NXP Semiconductors—a move that will help it avoid paying billions in U.S. taxes, according to Americans for Tax Fairness. And scores of U.S. companies have actually “inverted,” turning themselves into nominally foreign companies so as to take advantage of such firms’ ability to bring cash earned abroad into the United States tax free.

Man with a plan: Trump at a Carrier plant in Indianapolis, December 2016. CHRIS BERGIN / REUTERS

To reverse this trend and encourage U.S. companies to bring their foreign cash home for investment, Trump has proposed reducing the tax on repatriated earnings from 35 percent to ten percent. The move has broad support among Republicans in Congress, and some combination of a lower corporate tax rate and a lower tax on repatriated funds will likely be passed into law.

Another factor holding the U.S. economy back has been excessive regulation. Unnecessary regulation makes it harder for companies to succeed and results in increased costs, lower investment, and restricted growth. This has been especially true of the financial sector in recent years, as reactions to the financial crisis overshot the mark. Not all regulation is pernicious, of course. Higher capital requirements and the elimination of off-balance-sheet financing, for example, have helped strengthen the domestic and global financial systems. But many of the financial regulations in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act have placed heavy burdens of compliance on companies and impeded lending.

The cost of complying with cumbersome new regulations has been staggering. For example, from 2011 to 2015 alone, the ten largest U.S. banks collectively paid $52.5 billion in consulting and advisory fees on compliance-related issues. In 2014, Citibank had 30,000 employees working on compliance and regulatory issues, up by 33 percent from three years earlier. In the same year, J.P. Morgan increased its risk-control staff by 33 percent, in addition to using thousands of outside consultants.

The cost of complying with cumbersome new regulations has been staggering.

The obstacles to growth caused by excessive and poorly conceived regulation are part of the reason the current economic recovery has been so slow compared with its predecessors. Limitations on credit have put a damper on new home construction, consumer spending, and business investment.

The mortgage sector offers an example of the complexity, redundancies, and wastefulness of ill-considered government intervention. Regulators have been fighting one another about who has authority over the area, with each regulator imposing its own layer of often conflicting regulations. The result has been an almost total halt in private mortgage securitizations, which have fallen by 99 percent from their 2005 peak of over $1 trillion in annual issuance. This near freeze has deprived a huge segment of Americans of mortgage financing. Overregulation and the collapse of the private mortgage securitization market have restrained the recovery in new home construction—which helps explain why, although new home construction has risen from its recent lows, it is still far below its previous peak and below the average level of housing required.

To lead the effort to break up the regulatory clog, Trump has appointed two highly capable executives. Mnuchin is the former CEO of OneWest Bank, and Gary Cohn, Trump’s choice to head the National Economic Council, is the former president of Goldman Sachs. Both have extensive knowledge of the negative effects that excessive regulation has on the availability of credit and on growth. And beyond finance, other sectors ripe for regulatory reform include health care, labor, and energy.

A competitive corporate tax structure and reduced regulation will lead to higher economic growth. There are scores of real-life examples that show the impact of tax and regulatory policies on growth, and some patterns are clear. Generally, countries with high tax rates and high regulation (such as France and Italy) achieve lower growth, while those with low tax rates and low regulation (such as Ireland) achieve higher growth.

A competitive corporate tax structure and reduced regulation will lead to higher economic growth.

With the second-lowest corporate tax rate in Europe and light regulation, Ireland has the highest growth rate in the region and offers a model to follow. When asked why businesses invest there, executives point to the business-friendly environment. And even my own firm, after reviewing many other locations in Europe, chose to locate its offshore services operations in Dublin for the same reason.

BEYOND TAXES AND REGULATION

The United States has abundant energy resources and the technology to exploit them in previously unimaginable ways. A barrage of regulations, however, have made it difficult to reap the full benefits of this situation. The Trump administration plans to lift restrictions and streamline the permitting process in order to facilitate growth in energy production and infrastructure.

A good example of such barriers to growth can be found in the slow rate of approval for export terminals for liquefied natural gas. American firms have developed technology that allows them to extract gas from previously unattainable sources at extremely low prices. Unless the gas is liquefied, however, it cannot be exported and remains trapped in the United States. The construction of liquefied natural gas export terminals would allow it to be sold abroad. This would encourage still more development at home, creating more jobs, reducing the trade deficit, and spurring growth. Unfortunately, such construction has been delayed and restricted because of the vast number of approvals required from agencies that include the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Department of Energy, and many others.

A final component of the Trump administration’s economic plan will be the renegotiation of trade deals so as to protect and expand U.S. exports. Trump has said that he is not opposed to trade in general—in fact, he strongly favors it—but he does oppose unfair trade. And dealings with China are a good example of where improvements can be made.

The United States has abundant energy resources and the technology to exploit them in previously unimaginable ways.

In 2015, the United States imported $482 billion worth of goods from China while exporting only $116 billion, leading to a trade deficit of $366 billion. Chinese firms have almost unrestricted access to U.S. markets, yet U.S. firms face severe restrictions and roadblocks when trying to do business in China. Putting the commercial relationship on more equal terms, as well as tightening up the enforcement of intellectual property laws, would help raise U.S. exports and significantly reduce the bilateral trade deficit.

Making the United States an attractive place for investment, supporting export industries, and improving terms of trade with foreign counterparts will go a long way toward improving the U.S. trade balance, boosting U.S. growth in the process.

Disregarding the media’s gloom and doom, U.S. investors and businesses have responded more favorably to the incoming administration’s economic plans than most expected, with the S&P 500 rising by more than seven percent between the election and the end of the year and financial services rallying 19 percent. In December, Ray Dalio, chair of the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, said that Trump’s pro-business outlook could help boost growth. And in January, Mark Fields, the CEO of the Ford Motor Company, announced that Ford would cancel a $1.6 billion project in Mexico and instead expand its operations in Michigan, citing “the more positive U.S. business environment” that he expected under Trump.

Competitive corporate taxes, easier repatriation of foreign earnings, a less burdensome regulatory environment, expanded domestic energy production, and trade deals that give U.S. companies a fair chance to compete—together these will create jobs, accelerate growth, and lead to a new era of American prosperity.","(0, 'GDP')"

It focuses on current market conditions, highlighting systemic issues that could pose a risk to financial stability and sustained market access by emerging market borrowers. The Report draws out the financial ramifications of economic imbalances highlighted by the IMF's World Economic Outlook. It contains, as special features, analytical chapters or essays on structural or systemic issues relevant to international financial stability.

2024

The Last Mile: Financial Vulnerabilities and Risks April 16, 2024 Description: Chapter 1 highlight the near-term global financial stability risks have receded amid expectations that global disinflation is entering its last mile. However, along it, there are several salient risks and a build-up of medium-term vulnerabilities. Chapter 2 assesses vulnerabilities and potential risks to financial stability in corporate private credit, a rapidly growing asset class—traditionally focused on providing loans to midsize firms outside the realms of either commercial banks or public debt markets—that now rivals other major credit markets in size. Chapter 3 shows that while cyber incidents have thus far not been systemic, the probability of severe cyber incidents has increased, posing an acute threat to macrofinancial stability.

2023

Global Financial Stability Report, October 2023: Financial and Climate Policies for a High-Interest-Rate Era October 10, 2023 Description: Financial and Climate Policies for a High-Interest-Rate Era Chapter 1 assesses that risks to global growth are skewed to the downside, similar to the assessment in the April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report. Cracks in the financial system may turn into worrisome fault lines should a soft landing of the global economy hoped for by market participants does not materialize. Chapter 2 homes in on the global banking system, providing a fresh assessment of vulnerabilities in a higher-for-longer environment, using an enhanced global stress test and a set of newly developed market-based indicators. In response to the vulnerabilities that are uncovered, enhancements to supervisory practices and tightening of regulatory standards are proposed. Chapter 3 notes that a broad mix of policies is required to unlock the private capital necessary to cover climate mitigation investment needs in emerging market and developing economies.

Global Financial Stability Report, April 2023: Safeguarding Financial Stability amid High Inflation and Geopolitical Risks April 11, 2023 Description: Safeguarding Financial Stability amid High Inflation and Geopolitical Risks Chapter 1 analyzes the recent turmoil in the banking sector and the challenges posed by the interaction between tighter monetary and financial conditions and the buildup in vulnerabilities since the global financial crisis. The emergence of stress in financial markets complicates the task of central banks at a time when inflationary pressures are proving to be more persistent than anticipated. Smaller and riskier emerging markets continue to confront worsening debt sustainability trends. Chapter 2 examines nonbank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) and the vulnerabilities that can emerge from elevated leverage, liquidity mismatches, and high levels of interconnectedness. Tools to tackle the financial stability consequences of NBFI stress are proposed, underscoring that direct access to central bank liquidity could prove necessary in times of stress, but implementing appropriate guardrails is paramount. Chapter 3 analyzes the effect of geopolitical tensions on financial fragmentation and explores their implications for financial stability—including through potential capital flow reversals, disruptions of cross-border payments, impact on banks’ funding costs, profitability, and credit provision, and more limited opportunities for international risk diversification. Based on the findings, it draws policy recommendations aimed at strengthening financial oversight, building larger buffers, and enhancing international cooperation.

2022

Global Financial Stability Report, October 2022: Navigating the High-Inflation Environment October 11, 2022 Description: Navigating the High-Inflation Environment Chapter 1 analyzes the policy response of central banks to high inflation, the risks of a disorderly tightening of financial conditions, and debt distress among emerging and frontier markets. Markets have been extremely volatile, and a deterioration in market liquidity appears to have amplified price moves. In Europe, the energy crisis is contributing to a worsening outlook. In China, the property sector remains a key source of vulnerability. Chapter 2 examines how to narrow the climate financing gap in emerging market and developing economies. Climate policies, including carbon pricing, climate disclosures, and transition taxonomies, are crucial for enabling private climate finance. Innovative financial instruments can help to scale up private climate finance, but the public sector—including multilateral development banks—will have to play a key supporting role. Chapter 3 analyzes the contributions of open-end investment funds to fragilities in asset markets. Open-end investment funds play a key role in financial markets, but those offering daily redemptions while holding illiquid assets can amplify the effects of adverse shocks by raising the likelihood of investor runs and asset fire sales. This contributes to volatility in asset markets and potentially threatens financial stability.

Global Financial Stability Report, April 2022: Shockwaves from the War in Ukraine Test the Financial System’s Resilience April 19, 2022 Description: Shockwaves from the War in Ukraine Test the Financial System’s Resilience Chapter 1 looks at the implications of the war in Ukraine on the financial system. Commodity prices pose challenging trade-offs for central banks. Many emerging and frontier markets are facing especially difficult conditions. In China, financial vulnerabilities remain elevated amid ongoing stress in the property sector and new COVID-19 outbreaks. Central banks should act decisively to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched without jeopardizing the recovery. Policymakers will need to confront the structural issues brought to the fore by the war, including the trade-off between energy security and climate transition. Chapter 2 discusses the sovereign-bank nexus in emerging markets. Bank holdings of domestic sovereign bonds have surged in emerging markets during the pandemic. With public debt at historically high levels and the sovereign credit outlook deteriorating, there is a risk of a negative feedback loop that could threaten macro-financial stability. Chapter 3 examines the challenges to financial stability posed by the rapid rise of risky business segments in fintech. Policies that target both fintech firms and incumbent banks proportionately are needed.

2021

Global Financial Stability Report, October 2021 October 6, 2021 Description: Financial stability risks have been contained so far, reflecting ongoing policy support and a rebound in the global economy earlier this year. Chapter 1 explains that financial conditions have eased further in net in advanced economies but changed little in emerging markets. However, the optimism that propelled markets earlier in the year has faded on growing concerns about the strength of the global recovery, and ongoing supply chain disruptions intensified inflation concerns. Signs of stretched asset valuations in some market segments persist, and pockets of vulnerabilities remain in the nonbank financial sector; recovery is uneven in the corporate sector. Chapter 2 discusses the opportunities and challenges of the crypto ecosystem. Crypto asset providers’ lack of operational or cyber resilience poses risks, and significant data gaps imperil financial integrity. Crypto assets in emerging markets may accelerate dollarization risks. Chapter 3 shows that sustainable funds can support the global transition to a green economy but must be scaled up to have a major impact. It also discusses how a disorderly transition could disrupt the broader investment fund sector in the future.

Global Financial Stability Report, April 2021: Preempting a Legacy of Vulnerabilities April 6, 2021 Description: Extraordinary policy measures have eased financial conditions and supported the economy, helping to contain financial stability risks. Chapter 1 warns that there is a pressing need to act to avoid a legacy of vulnerabilities while avoiding a broad tightening of financial conditions. Actions taken during the pandemic may have unintended consequences such as stretched valuations and rising financial vulnerabilities. The recovery is also expected to be asynchronous and divergent between advanced and emerging market economies. Given large external financing needs, several emerging markets face challenges, especially if a persistent rise in US rates brings about a repricing of risk and tighter financial conditions. The corporate sector in many countries is emerging from the pandemic overindebted, with notable differences depending on firm size and sector. Concerns about the credit quality of hard-hit borrowers and profitability are likely to weigh on the risk appetite of banks. Chapter 2 studies leverage in the nonfinancial private sector before and during the COVID-19 crisis, pointing out that policymakers face a trade-off between boosting growth in the short term by facilitating an easing of financial conditions and containing future downside risks. This trade-off may be amplified by the existing high and rapidly building leverage, increasing downside risks to future growth. The appropriate timing for deployment of macroprudential tools should be country-specific, depending on the pace of recovery, vulnerabilities, and policy tools available. Chapter 3 turns to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the commercial real estate sector. While there is little evidence of large price misalignments at the onset of the pandemic, signs of overvaluation have now emerged in some economies. Misalignments in commercial real estate prices, especially if they interact with other vulnerabilities, increase downside risks to future growth due to the possibility of sharp price corrections.

2020

Global Financial Stability Report: Bridge to Recovery October 13, 2020 Description: Near-term global financial stability risks have been contained as an unprecedented policy response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has helped avert a financial meltdown and maintain the flow of credit to the economy. For the first time, many emerging market central banks have launched asset purchase programs to support the smooth functioning of financial markets and the overall economy. But the outlook remains highly uncertain, and vulnerabilities are rising, representing potential headwinds to recovery. The report presents an assessment of the real-financial disconnect, as well as forward-looking analysis of nonfinancial firms, banks, and emerging market capital flows. After the outbreak, firms’ cash flows were adversely affected as economic activity declined sharply. More vulnerable firms—those with weaker solvency and liquidity positions and smaller size—experienced greater financial stress than their peers in the early stages of the crisis. As the crisis unfolds, corporate liquidity pressures may morph into insolvencies, especially if the recovery is delayed. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are more vulnerable than large firms with access to capital markets. Although the global banking system is well capitalized, some banking systems may experience capital shortfalls in an adverse scenario, even with the currently deployed policy measures. The report also assesses the pandemic’s impact on firms’ environmental performance to gauge the extent to which the crisis may result in a reversal of the gains posted in recent years.","(4, 'national debt')"

Ratings

Helpful Hints for Determining Your FIRST Rating

The following steps should be taken to anticipate and make the best estimate of how a district will score on FIRST: Review the information before the annual financial audit is completed. (The annual financial report [AFR] belongs to the district, not the CPA firm. It is the district’s responsibility.) This should involve spot-checking numbers against the district’s general ledger and other financial records. Ask the auditor about anything that does not look correct in AFR. (Examples: Why is the unrestricted net position negative? Were there any identified material miscoding errors?) If deemed appropriate, ask the Education Service Center to help review the AFR before it is finalized or contract with another CPA firm to help with the review. Use the Texas Association of School Business Officials (TASBO) Schools FIRST Template (https://www.tasbo.org/tools-services/schools-first-communication-kit) to run your estimated FIRST results. Attend presentations on FIRST and use the information. If you have questions, contact TEA's Financial Compliance Division at 512-463-9095 or financialaccountability@tea.texas.gov.

Chapter 1 looks at the implications of the war in Ukraine on the financial system. Commodity prices pose challenging trade-offs for central banks. Many emerging and frontier markets are facing especially difficult conditions. In China, financial vulnerabilities remain elevated amid ongoing stress in the property sector and new COVID-19 outbreaks. Central banks should act decisively to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched without jeopardizing the recovery. Policymakers will need to confront the structural issues brought to the fore by the war, including the trade-off between energy security and climate transition.

Chapter 2 discusses the sovereign-bank nexus in emerging markets. Bank holdings of domestic sovereign bonds have surged in emerging markets during the pandemic. With public debt at historically high levels and the sovereign credit outlook deteriorating, there is a risk of a negative feedback loop that could threaten macro-financial stability. Chapter 3 examines the challenges to financial stability posed by the rapid rise of risky business segments in fintech. Policies that target both fintech firms and incumbent banks proportionately are needed.","(3, 'inflation')"

2. the country’s financial stability policy framework; and

Washington, April 17, 2024 - Today, the House Financial Services Committee, led by Chairman Patrick McHenry (NC-10), reported 13 pieces of legislation out of Committee to the full House for consideration. Included among the measures is a slate of Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions to nullify a series of gross regulatory oversteps on the part of Biden’s regulators. The Committee also considered measures to preserve and promote innovation in financial services and correct provisions in existing law that are being exploited for uses other than their intended purposes.









More information on all 13 bills reported out of the Financial Services Committee can be found below including Member remarks in support of their legislation: H.R. 5535, the “Insurance Data Protection Act,” offered by Rep. Scott Fitzgerald (WI-05) eliminates the ability of the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) and the Office of Financial Research (OFR) to subpoena data directly from insurance companies. Instead, the bill requires FIO and OFR to work collaboratively with state insurance commissioners to obtain such information. Watch Rep. Fitzgerald’s remarks in support of H.R. 5535 here.



H.R. 802, the “Respect State Housing Laws Act,” offered by Rep. Barry Loudermilk (GA-11), corrects a drafting error in the CARES Act, which some trial lawyers have falsely claimed created a permanent 30-day federal eviction notice requirement.

Watch Rep. Loudermilk’s remarks in support of H.R. 802 here.

H.R. 7437, the “Fostering the Use of Technology to Uphold Regulatory Effectiveness in Supervision (FUTURES) Act,” offered by Rep. Erin Houchin (IN-09), requires the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OCC, CFPB, and NCUA to assess the challenges and risks resulting from their outdated supervisory technologies and internal procurement practices. The agencies would be required to jointly submit a report to Congress, and every five years thereafter, detailing their findings.

Watch Rep. Houchin’s remarks in support of H.R. 7437 here.

H.R. 7440, the “Financial Services Innovation Act of 2024,” as amended, offered by Chairman McHenry, establishes Financial Services Innovation Offices within each financial regulator and a federal sandbox for innovative financial products and services. Each FSIO will assess burdensome agency regulations that hinder innovation, as well as evaluate and approve alternative compliance agreements for entities wishing to offer innovative products and services.

Watch Chairman McHenry’s remarks in support of H.R. 7440 here.

H.R. 7428, the ""Earned Wage Access Consumer Protection Act,” offered by Rep. Bryan Steil (WI-01), creates a transparent regulatory framework for earned wage access (EWA) products that ensures consumers are not assessed mandatory or hidden fees while also mandating numerous disclosures. Additionally, this bill sets requirements for EWA providers to establish dispute resolution procedures and certain notification requirements.

Watch Rep. Steil’s remarks in support of H.R. 7428 here.

H.J. Res. 127, “a resolution providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the ‘Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors,’” introduced by Rep. Bill Huizenga (MI-04), nullifies the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) disastrous climate disclosure rule, which exceeds the agency’s authority, threatens our economy, weakens our capital markets, and would overwhelm investors with non-economic information.

H.J. Res. 122, “a resolution providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau relating to credit card penalty fees (Regulation Z),” introduced by Rep. Andy Barr (KY-06), nullifies the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) credit card late fee rule which will harm consumers by shifting costs to responsible consumers who pay on time in the form of higher annual fees and higher interest rates and removes incentives for timely payments.

Watch Rep. Barr’s remarks in support of H.J. Res. 122 here.

H.J. Res. 120, “a resolution providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) relating to ‘Guidance on Non-Bank Financial Company Determinations,’” offered by Rep. French Hill (AR-02), overturns the Biden Administration’s guidance on the nonbank designation process through the Financial Stability Oversight Council. This guidance represents another attempt by FSOC to become a roving regulator, ignoring the actual emerging risks that pose threats to our financial stability.

Watch Rep. Hill’s remarks in support of H.J. Res. 120 here.

H.J. Res. 125, H.J. Res. 126, and H.J. Res. 124, introduced by Rep. Fitzgerald, Rep. Houchin, and Rep Byron Donalds (FL-19) rescinds Biden’s banking regulators’ climate risk management principles for large financial institutions at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (Fed), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) respectively. These resolutions build on Republicans’ work to stop the Biden Administration from forcing a progressive climate policy agenda through financial regulation.

Watch Rep. Donalds’ remarks in support of H.J. Res. 124 here.

H.R. 4206, “Bank Safety Act of 2023,” offered by Rep. Brad Sherman (CA-32), requires bank holding companies, and banks without a holding company, with total consolidated assets over $100 billion to include certain net gains and losses in their regulatory capital calculations. The bill would authorize the Federal banking agencies to further define AOCI through the rulemaking process and would require the Federal banking agencies to phase-in the inclusion of AOCI, such that it is fully phased-in by July 1, 2028.

H.R. 4116, the “Systemic Risk Authority Transparency Act,” offered by Rep. Al Green (TX-09), increases transparency from the federal banking agencies and the Treasury Secretary when they invoke the systemic risk exception to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act’s least-cost resolution mandate for resolving failed banks. The GAO would also be required to issue a report to Congress on the use of the systemic risk exception.

Near-term risks to global financial stability have receded as disinflation is entering its last mile but medium-term vulnerabilities are mounting.

Chapter 1 documents that near-term global financial stability risks have receded amid expectations that global disinflation is entering its last mile. However, along it, there are several salient risks and a build-up of medium-term vulnerabilities.

Chapter 2 assesses vulnerabilities and potential risks to financial stability in corporate private credit, a rapidly growing asset class—traditionally focused on providing loans to midsize firms outside the realms of either commercial banks or public debt markets—that now rivals other major credit markets in size.

Chapter 3 shows that while cyber incidents have thus far not been systemic, the probability of severe cyber incidents has increased, posing an acute threat to macrofinancial stability.","(3, 'inflation')"

Investing in your future

A college degree is an important investment in your future, but learning how to finance that degree can be challenging. UD's Office of Financial Aid works to help students and families make paying for college accessible, understandable and actionable.

Get Started: Select your Student Classification.

We're here to help

The Office of Financial Aid is open from 8 AM to 5 PM Monday through Friday. We're located on the first floor of Cardinal Farrell Hall. #1 on the campus map.

We strive to meet the needs and concerns of our students on an individual basis. Financial Aid is intended to supplement, not replace, family resources.

The primary source of funding rests with both federal and state governments; therefore, government regulations determine a student's eligibility. We are required to comply with updated federal, state, and institutional regulations and policies.

If you are an undergraduate student with unusual circumstances, please click HERE for more information.

What is financial aid?

Federal, state, institutional, and private funds are used to assist eligible students in funding their education. Financial aid can be a combination of scholarships, grants, loans, waivers, and student employment. Scholarships and grants are considered “free money” that the student is not required to repay; however, loans and student employment are considered self-help aid. Most loans require repayment when a student becomes enrolled less than half-time or graduates. Student employment includes both work-study positions and part-time employment positions, either on- or off-campus.","(4, 'national debt')"

Welcome

The Office of Financial Aid at Seton Hall University is dedicated to assisting students and their families with any issues that may arise as they work through the financial aid process.

The primary purpose of financial aid is to provide assistance to students who otherwise would be unable to pursue their education. The basic premise of financial aid programs is that the primary responsibility for meeting college costs lies with the student and parents. When the family is unable to meet the cost of attendance, the Office of Financial Aid will do its best to provide the necessary aid. The Office of Financial Aid at Seton Hall University is dedicated to assisting students and their families with any issues that may arise as they work through the financial aid process.

All students must apply yearly for financial aid. To be considered for the full range of financial aid available, students should complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which is available October 1 each year. The processed results of the FAFSA must be received by SHU on or before January 15 to meet our priority date. Our school code is 002632.","(1, 'employment/wages')"

Full Report, Foreword, and Executive Summary

Extraordinary policy measures have eased financial conditions and supported the economy, helping to contain financial stability risks. Chapter 1 warns that there is a pressing need to act to avoid a legacy of vulnerabilities while avoiding a broad tightening of financial conditions. Actions taken during the pandemic may have unintended consequences such as stretched valuations and rising financial vulnerabilities. The recovery is also expected to be asynchronous and divergent between advanced and emerging market economies. Given large external financing needs, several emerging markets face challenges, especially if a persistent rise in US rates brings about a repricing of risk and tighter financial conditions. The corporate sector in many countries is emerging from the pandemic overindebted, with notable differences depending on firm size and sector. Concerns about the credit quality of hard-hit borrowers and profitability are likely to weigh on the risk appetite of banks. Chapter 2 studies leverage in the nonfinancial private sector before and during the COVID-19 crisis, pointing out that policymakers face a trade-off between boosting growth in the short term by facilitating an easing of financial conditions and containing future downside risks. This trade-off may be amplified by the existing high and rapidly building leverage, increasing downside risks to future growth. The appropriate timing for deployment of macroprudential tools should be country-specific, depending on the pace of recovery, vulnerabilities, and policy tools available. Chapter 3 turns to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the commercial real estate sector. While there is little evidence of large price misalignments at the onset of the pandemic, signs of overvaluation have now emerged in some economies. Misalignments in commercial real estate prices, especially if they interact with other vulnerabilities, increase downside risks to future growth due to the possibility of sharp price corrections.","(4, 'national debt')"

Full Text

The October 2017 Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR) finds that the global financial system continues to strengthen in response to extraordinary policy support, regulatory enhancements, and the cyclical upturn in growth. Global bank balance sheets are stronger because of improved capital and liquidity buffers, amid tighter regulation and heightened market scrutiny. However, some banks are still grappling with legacy issues and business model challenges, where progress has been uneven. The environment of continuing monetary accommodation—necessary to support activity and boost inflation—may lead to a continued search for yield where there is too much money chasing too few yielding assets, pushing investors beyond their traditional habitats. As the search for yield intensifies, vulnerabilities are shifting to the nonbank sector and market risks are rising. This may lead to a further compression of risk compensation in markets and higher leverage in the nonfinancial sector. These challenges must be managed carefully to avoid putting growth at risk. Policymakers at both the national and global level will have to strengthen the financial and macroeconomic policy mix. The October 2017 GFSR also includes a chapter that examines the short- and medium-term implications for economic growth and financial stability of the past decades’ rise in household debt. It documents large differences in household debt-to-GDP ratios across countries but a common increasing trajectory that was moderated but not reversed by the global financial crisis. Another chapter develops a new macroeconomic measure of financial stability by linking financial conditions to the probability distribution of future GDP growth and applies it to a set of 21 major advanced and emerging market economies. The chapter shows that changes in financial conditions shift the whole distribution of future GDP growth.","(3, 'inflation')"

Chapter 1 analyzes the policy response of central banks to high inflation, the risks of a disorderly tightening of financial conditions, and debt distress among emerging and frontier markets. Markets have been extremely volatile, and a deterioration in market liquidity appears to have amplified price moves. In Europe, the energy crisis is contributing to a worsening outlook. In China, the property sector remains a key source of vulnerability . Chapter 2 examines how to narrow the climate financing gap in emerging market and developing economies. Climate policies, including carbon pricing, climate disclosures , and transition taxonomies, are crucial for enabling private climate finance. Innovative financial instruments can help to scale up private climate finance, but the public sector — including m ultilateral d evelopment b anks — will have to play a key supporting role. Chapter 3 analyzes the contributions of open-end investment funds to fragilities in asset markets. Open-end investment funds play a key role in financial markets, but those offering daily redemptions while holding illiquid assets can amplify the effects of adverse shocks by raising the likelihood of investor runs and asset fire sales. This contributes to volatility in asset markets and potentially threatens financial stability.","(4, 'national debt')"
434,Financial Technology: Agencies Can Better Support Workforce Expertise and Measure the Performance of Innovation ... - Government Accountability Office,Financial Technology: Agencies Can Better Support Workforce Expertise and Measure the Performance of Innovation ...  Government Accountability Office,"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdhby5nb3YvcHJvZHVjdHMvZ2FvLTIzLTEwNjE2ONIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Government Accountability Office,"What GAO Found

Financial technology refers to the use of technology and innovation to provide financial products and services. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) require many of their staff responsible for policymaking and oversight related to financial technology to have some level of technological skills, according to 181 position descriptions GAO reviewed. The skill requirements ranged from basic technological skills, such as knowledge of office software, to more specialized knowledge, such as expertise in data analysis. The agencies expressly required knowledge of financial technology in 18 of the position descriptions. GAO held focus groups with agency staff where less than half of the participants said they had financial technology-related skills.

The agencies have taken some steps to incorporate leading workforce planning practices identified by GAO in prior work. For example, all of the agencies have developed programs or provided training to help develop staff knowledge of financial technology. However, the agencies have not systematically or comprehensively collected data on their policymaking and oversight staff's technological skills related to financial technology or conducted assessments to determine the financial technology skills these staff need. The agencies also have not measured the effectiveness of their financial technology training in addressing their skill needs. By fully incorporating leading workforce planning practices, the agencies could help ensure their staff have the knowledge and skills needed to effectively conduct policymaking and oversight related to financial technology.

CFPB, NCUA, and OCC have offices dedicated to addressing innovation in financial technology or the financial industry more broadly. These innovation offices research and monitor industry developments and communicate with industry participants, such as through conference participation (though CFPB's and OCC's offices have recently paused or stopped some outreach and innovation-related activities). The three innovation offices, however, have not developed performance goals or measures that target their key activities. Doing so could help ensure the offices are better able to assess the effectiveness of their initiatives and the extent to which they are accomplishing their missions.

All of the regulators reported using a variety of technologies to improve their supervisory capabilities. Examples include a tool that reviews compliance with certain legal requirements and the use of machine learning techniques to help identify risk. Additionally, all of the regulators had at least one strategic objective focused on improving supervision with technology. However, CFPB, the Federal Reserve, NCUA, and OCC have not developed performance measures for these objectives. Doing so could better position the agencies to gauge their progress toward enhancing their supervisory capabilities through the use of technology.

Why GAO Did This Study

Financial institutions are increasingly using financial technology. However, policymakers have raised questions about whether regulators' staff have the technological skills and expertise needed to oversee entities offering products and services that use this technology. GAO was asked to review regulators' financial technology expertise, among other issues. This report examines (1) the technological skills or expertise of regulators' staff, (2) regulators' workforce planning practices, (3) how regulators address innovation in financial technology, and (4) how regulators use technology to improve their supervisory capabilities.

GAO reviewed 181 position descriptions and documentation on regulators' workforce planning, innovation offices, and supervisory technology. GAO also conducted 16 focus groups with nongeneralizable samples of policymaking and oversight staff from each agency (90 total staff across the five agencies).","(4, 'national debt')"

(Photo Credit: U.S. Army photo by G. Anthonie Riis) VIEW ORIGINAL

WASHINGTON — Training and guidance on financial concerns is delivered worldwide in the Army through the Financial Readiness Program, which is designed to educate Soldiers and their families in support of mission readiness.

""Financial stress is a highly-individualized experience and can affect every area of your life. Even the best laid financial plans can go astray,"" says Robyn Mroszczyk, an accredited financial counselor and the Financial Education Program manager with the Directorate of Prevention, Resilience and Readiness at the Pentagon.

That's why financial readiness training is so important for Soldiers and their families, she said.

The Army's Financial Readiness Program is available at every installation. The Army Community Service uses the Financial Readiness Program to teach Soldiers, through classroom, online and individual sessions, how to save and invest, how to establish savings goals, debt elimination strategies, and how best to save for emergencies. In addition, National Guard and Reserve service members and their family and survivors can access no-cost financial counseling services with a personal financial counselor through the Office of Financial Readiness website Mroszczyk said.

The Power of Numbers

Soldiers talk about physical fitness scores. Every Soldier is rated by number on how they show proficiency in their individual job. Yet, many Soldiers likely do not know that an important number in their military career is their credit score.

“Many people don’t actually realize, the military has moved to a continuous vetting process in terms of security clearances,” Mroszczyk said. “Every single person must be able to attain and maintain a favorable security adjudication. … That wasn’t always the case,” she said.

“Guess what is the number-one factor for security adjudication?” she asked. “Financial considerations are the number-one reason for security adjudications. And where do they pull that from? From your credit report.”

That means neglecting financial obligations can lead to severe consequences in the military, including negative evaluations, hindered promotion prospects, loss of security clearance, rank reduction, administrative actions and more, she said.

Access to credit, which is determined by an individual’s credit score, is one of the three fundamental issues for new Soldiers when it comes to finances.

“When they come into the Army, they’re going to be faced with a lot of different obstacles. One of them will be their age. It’s going to be the lifestyle that they lead, and their access to credit. Those are the top three,” Mroszczyk said.

That is why financial literacy and financial planning are important for Soldiers of all ranks. It’s critical for leaders to actively engage in addressing these matters with their Soldiers.

“I can’t make you handle your finances. I can empower you,” Mroszczyk said.

Teaching Monetary Management

The Army offers preventative classes in personal monetary management and readiness and consumer affairs classes for Soldiers and family members. The instruction includes an overview of banking and credit union services; budget development and record keeping; the use and abuse of credit; consumer rights and obligations; buying insurance; how critical life changes impact personal finances; and wide-ranging guidance that addresses everything from how to read a leave and earnings statement to financial planning for family separation.

Training is crucial for developing individual strategies to achieve financial goals and maintain financial well-being. The objectives encompass understanding the potential effects of financial decisions on personal and professional lives, acquiring the necessary resources for prudent consumer decisions, navigating financial transactions and practices, and accessing related services and support, Mroszczyk said.

The Army also provides specific classes and videos that touch on three of the most important issues when it comes to personal finances: budgeting tools for spouses; planning for a permanent change of station; and planning for if or when the Soldier is deployed.

Military Travel

As an Army spouse with 10 PCS moves, Mroszczyk understands how transfers can be a challenging milestone for all military families. She said the key to permanent change of station moves is to remember that each move is different, and the next one won’t be anything like the last. What every family should prepare for is to avoid last-minute expenses on a PCS.

Whether a move is months or weeks away, Soldiers and families should have an overall financial plan for a move, an emergency fund to fall back on, and should expect the unexpected, like a flat tire or other disruptions.

“Emergencies can happen. You need to have a plan,” she said.

Financial planning classes and counseling are conducted for all junior enlisted Soldiers, E-4 and below, who are scheduled for their initial PCS move.

Visit the Financial Frontline page on PCSing for more guidance on family moves.

Soldiers on Deployment

Another stressful milestone is preparing for deployment.

“It is an emotional time. Soldiers facing deployment must be able to plan accordingly, set goals, and update their spending plan,” Mroszczyk said.

“Incomes change, expenses change,” she said. “You must be self-aware and be prepared.”

Guidance for considering what to do pre-deployment is available on the Financial Frontline pre-deployment page.

Making a budget to know how your money is spent is key to knowing how much to save for emergencies and retirement. Financial counselors at Army Community Service-Financial Readiness are eager to help clients examine their budgets, analyze their spending and create realistic budgets that will allow them to use their money most efficiently. (Photo Credit: U.S. Army photo by Stephanie Ingersoll) VIEW ORIGINAL

Family Resources

Soldiers and their family can receive financial training from the Army Community Service or through distributed learning on the Army Family Web Portal.

Financial counseling services are also available for Soldiers and family members to help with personal budget development and financial planning, developing a spending plan, managing personal finances, and evaluating assets and liabilities, Mroszczyk said. Spouses are encouraged to attend.

There are also programs to guide commanders in helping Soldiers and their family members with problems of personal financial indebtedness, Mroszczyk said.

These programs help Soldiers resolve a financial crisis by analyzing their assets and liabilities and, if appropriate, enrolling them in a debt liquidation program. Counselors can assist Soldiers in developing a repayment plan and in notifying the creditors that the Soldier is enrolled in the program.

Soldiers are also pre-screened to determine Family Subsistence Supplemental Assistance Program eligibility.

More Online Resources

Guidance offered on post and online explains the varied concepts in standard language and not in military jargon. It helps Army families enhance communications and encourages talking about the state of their finances. Visit MilSpouse Money Mission for more information.

The Financial Frontline website provides a variety of financial literacy resources for Soldiers, families, leaders and service providers.

Army Emergency Relief is the service's nonprofit organization dedicated to alleviating financial distress in the force. AER provides grants and zero-interest loans to active duty and retired Soldiers and their families.

Financial literacy provides the pathway for sustaining financial well-being and resiliency, with benchmarks of meeting all financial responsibilities, building wealth, obtaining a sound financial future and a secure retirement, Mroszczyk said.

Soldiers have a responsibility to be financially literate. The Army has resources to support that. The struggle is when people don’t use them, Mroszczyk said.

Update: March 7, 2024

FAFSA Data Transmission Delayed

At the end of January, the U.S. Department of Education announced a delay in sending FAFSA data to schools. Originally scheduled for late January, these data transmissions now are expected to begin in mid-March.

We have been preparing for the receipt of the data files by completing all necessary testing as software updates become available. Our goal is to provide new students with a financial aid offer at the first available opportunity. We recognize the uncertainty you may feel as you wait for this important financial information and are grateful for your patience.

The new FAFSA application is a simpler, quicker process! In its first week of launch, the site was down periodically as the U.S. Department of Education (ED) monitored the new user experience. The FAFSA is now up 24/7. This page at studentaid.gov has information about how to make sure you are prepared to complete the new FAFSA before beginning the process. ED also is reminding families that Federal Student Aid will not be transmitting FAFSA results to schools until March, so Kettering will not receive your FAFSA information until that time. For up-to-date information about the new FAFSA from ED, visit studentaid.gov. The FAFSA Simplification Act, passed by Congress in 2021, contains significant changes to how federal aid is processed. Key changes required by the law include:

A streamlined FAFSA application

A new method of determining aid called the Student Aid Index (SAI), which will replace Expected Family Contribution (EFC)

Financial stability risks contained so far, but despite improvements vulnerabilities remain elevated in some sectors

Financial stability risks have been contained so far, reflecting ongoing policy support and a rebound in the global economy earlier this year. Chapter 1 explains that financial conditions have eased further in net in advanced economies but changed little in emerging markets. However, the optimism that propelled markets earlier in the year has faded on growing concerns about the strength of the global recovery, and ongoing supply chain disruptions intensified inflation concerns. Signs of stretched asset valuations in some market segments persist, and pockets of vulnerabilities remain in the nonbank financial sector; recovery is uneven in the corporate sector.

Chapter 2 discusses the opportunities and challenges of the crypto ecosystem. Crypto asset providers’ lack of operational or cyber resilience poses risks, and significant data gaps imperil financial integrity. Crypto assets in emerging markets may accelerate dollarization risks. Chapter 3 shows that sustainable funds can support the global transition to a green economy but must be scaled up to have a major impact. It also discusses how a disorderly transition could disrupt the broader investment fund sector in the future.","(3, 'inflation')"

Chapter 1 assesses that risks to global growth are skewed to the downside, similar to the assessment in the April 2023 Global Financial Stability Report. Cracks in the financial system may turn into worrisome fault lines should a soft landing of the global economy hoped for by market participants does not materialize.

Chapter 2 homes in on the global banking system, providing a fresh assessment of vulnerabilities in a higher-for-longer environment, using an enhanced global stress test and a set of newly developed market-based indicators. In response to the vulnerabilities that are uncovered, enhancements to supervisory practices and tightening of regulatory standards are proposed.

Chapter 3 notes that a broad mix of policies is required to unlock the private capital necessary to cover climate mitigation investment needs in emerging market and developing economies.","(3, 'inflation')"

What's New?

On April 15, 2024, the Administration released the Risk Management and Financial Assurance for OCS Lease and Grant Obligations Rule. With this action, financial assurance requirements for the offshore oil and gas industry operating on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) were simplified and strengthened.

Decommissioning liabilities on the OCS are substantial and costs are increasing. This rule finalizes amendments to existing regulations in order to better protect the American taxpayer from bearing the cost of oil and gas facility decommissioning and other financial risks associated with OCS development, such as environmental remediation.

Background

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) released two reports, one in December 2015 and another in February 2024, both affirming the need for strengthened financial assurance requirements for offshore oil and gas operations.

GAO recommended that BOEM complete and fully implement strengthened requirements that reduce financial risks, including by requiring higher levels of supplemental bonding. BOEM addresses concerns expressed in the GAO reports with the 2024 publication of the Risk Management and Financial Assurance Rule.

On June 29, 2023, BOEM published the Proposed Risk Management and Financial Assurance Rule for public comment that ended on September 7, 2023. BOEM carefully considered all comments before publishing the final rule on April 15, 2024.

After the Civil War, the US banking system grew rapidly and seemed to be set on solid ground. But the country was hit by many banking crises. One of the worst happened in 1873 – during the time of the Freedman’s Bank.

The panic started with a problem in Europe, when the stock market crashed. Investors began to sell off the investments they had in American projects, particularly railroads. Back in those days, railroads were a new invention, and companies had been borrowing money to get the cash they needed to build new lines. Railroad companies borrowed using bonds, which were debt securities specifying how much a company was borrowing and how much interest it would pay.

When Europeans started selling their railroad bonds, there were soon more bonds for sale than anyone wanted. Railroad companies could no longer find anyone who would lend them cash. Many railroads went bankrupt.

One of the biggest banks in New York City was Jay Cooke & Company. It had invested a lot of money in the railroads, and when the railroads started having problems, Jay Cooke & Company went bankrupt. When people saw that such a big bank failed, they began to run to their banks, demanding all of their money back.

The panic spread to banks in Washington, DC, Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia and Georgia, as well as to banks in the Midwest, including those in Indiana, Illinois, and Ohio. Nationwide, at least 100 banks failed.

Such risks could intensify in coming months amid the continued tightening of monetary policy globally, making it especially important to understand and safeguard this broad swath of the financial sector that comprises an array of institutions beyond banks. Nonbank financial intermediaries, including pension funds, insurers, and hedge funds, also play a key role in the global financial system by providing financial services and credit and thus supporting economic growth.

The growth of the NBFI sector accelerated after the global financial crisis, accounting now for nearly 50 percent of global financial assets. As such, the smooth functioning of the nonbank sector is vital for financial stability.

However, NBFI vulnerabilities appear to have increased in the past decade. As we show in an analytical chapter of the latest Global Financial Stability Report, NBFI stress tends to emerge alongside elevated leverage, for example borrowing money to finance their investments or boost returns, or using financial instruments, like derivatives.

Stress is also brought on by liquidity mismatches, where an institution is unable to generate sufficient cash either through liquidation of assets, such as bonds or equities, or use of credit lines to satisfy investor redemption requests.

Finally, high levels of interconnectedness among NBFIs and with traditional banks can also become a crucial amplification channel of financial stress. Last year’s UK pension fund and liability-driven investment strategies episode underscores the perilous interplay of leverage, liquidity risk, and interconnectedness. Concerns about the country’s fiscal outlook led to a sharp rise in UK sovereign bond yields that, in turn, led to large losses in defined-benefit pension fund investments that borrowed against such collateral, causing margin and collateral calls. To meet these calls, pension funds were forced to sell government bonds, pushing their yields even higher.

It is useful to take a step back and look at the current environment in which NBFIs find themselves. With the fastest inflation in decades, and with price stability at the core of most central bank mandates, injecting central bank liquidity for financial stability purposes could complicate the fight against inflation. In a low-inflation environment, central banks can respond to financial stress by easing policy such as cutting interest rates or purchasing assets to restore market functioning.

Amid high inflation, however, challenging tradeoffs may emerge for central banks between fostering financial stability and achieving price stability during periods of stress that may threaten the health of the financial system.

Policymakers need appropriate tools to tackle turmoil in the NBFI sector that may adversely affect financial stability. Robust surveillance, regulation, and supervision are essential pre-requisites. Policymakers must also narrow or eliminate gaps in regulatory reporting of key data, including how much risk firms are taking with their borrowing or use of derivatives.

Policies are also needed to ensure NBFIs better manage risks, and this might be accomplished through timely and granular public data disclosures and governance requirements. These improvements in private sector risk management must be supported by appropriate prudential standards, including capital and liquidity requirements, alongside better resourced and stricter supervision.

This would help steer the business decisions of the NBFIs themselves away from excessive risk taking by removing both the incentive and opportunity to take on too much risk. It would also likely reduce the need for and frequency of central bank intervention to provide liquidity support during systemic stress events.

If central bank intervention is needed, they can consider three broad types of support:

Discretionary market-wide intervention should be temporary and targeted to those NBFI segments posing risk to financial stability. The timing is also critical—a framework should be in place where data-driven metrics trigger a potential intervention, while policymakers ultimately retain the discretion to intervene.





should be temporary and targeted to those NBFI segments posing risk to financial stability. The timing is also critical—a framework should be in place where data-driven metrics trigger a potential intervention, while policymakers ultimately retain the discretion to intervene. Lender-of-last-resort intervention should be available when a systemically important nonbank institution comes under stress. Such lending should be at the discretion of the central bank, at a higher interest rate, fully collateralized, and accompanied by greater supervisory oversight. A clear timeline should be established for restoring the NBFI’s liquidity and return to market finance.

Such lending should be at the discretion of the central bank, at a higher interest rate, fully collateralized, and accompanied by greater supervisory oversight. A clear timeline should be established for restoring the NBFI’s liquidity and return to market finance. Access to standing lending facilities could be granted to specific NBFI entities to reduce spillovers to the financial system, although the bar for such access should be very high to avoid moral hazard. Access should not be granted without the appropriate regulatory and supervisory regimes for the different types of NBFIs.

Clear communication is critical, so that liquidity support is not perceived to be working at cross-purposes with monetary policy. For example, purchasing assets to restore financial stability while continuing with quantitative tightening to bring inflation back to target may cloud intent and complicate communication. Announcements of central bank liquidity support should clearly explain the financial stability objectives, program parameters and timing.

At the same time, cooperation between domestic policy makers and international coordination between national authorities is essential. This helps better identify risks and manage crises. Specifically, internationally coordinated reforms can reduce the risks of cross-border spillovers, regulatory arbitrage, and market fragmentation.

Given the growing size and intermediation capacity of the NBFI sector globally, the development of the right toolbox for access to central bank liquidity, along with the appropriate guardrails limiting the need for its use, is a priority. The need to do so is all that much greater given that financial sector vulnerabilities could be poised to grow amid the continued tightening of monetary policy.

Summary

Full Text

The October 2018 Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR) finds that global near-term risks to financial stability have increased somewhat, reflecting mounting pressures in emerging market economies and escalating trade tensions. These risks, while still moderate, could increase significantly. An intensification of concerns about emerging markets, a broader rise in trade tensions, the realization of political and policy uncertainty, or a faster-than-expected tightening in monetary normalization could all lead to a sharp tightening in financial conditions. Medium-term financial stability risks remain elevated, driven by high non–financial sector leverage in advanced economies and rising external borrowing in emerging markets. Although the global banking system is stronger than before the crisis, it is exposed to highly indebted borrowers as well as to opaque and illiquid assets and foreign currency rollover risks. This all raises the urgency for policymakers to step up efforts to boost the financial system’s resilience by completing the financial regulatory reform agenda as well as developing and deploying macroprudential policy tools. This GFSR also takes stock of global regulatory reform 10 years after the global financial crisis. It reviews the main precrisis failings in financial sector oversight and assesses the progress in implementation of the reform agenda designed to address these failings. It also looks at whether shifts in market structure and risks in the global financial system since the crisis have been in the direction the new regulatory agenda intended, that is, toward greater safety. It finds that the broad agenda set by the international community has given rise to new standards that have contributed to a more resilient financial system—one that is less leveraged, more liquid, and better and more intensively supervised, especially at large banks. The forms of shadow banking more closely related to the global financial crisis have been curtailed, and most countries now have macroprudential authorities and some tools with which to oversee and contain risks to the whole financial system. The chapter also identifies areas in which consolidation or further progress is needed and warns against rolling back reforms, which might make the global financial system less safe.

Now, falling energy prices are reducing headline inflation and fueling optimism that monetary policy may be eased later this year.

Such expectations have caused a sharp decline in global longer-term interest rates and boosted financial markets in advanced economies and emerging markets alike.

Though this may make it tempting to conclude that monetary policy is becoming overly restrictive and poised to cause an unnecessary economic contraction, investors may be too sanguine about progress on disinflation. While headline inflation has indeed fallen, and core inflation has receded slightly in some countries, both remain far too high. Central banks must therefore be resolute in their fight against inflation and ensure policy remains appropriately tight long enough to durably bring inflation back to target.

Aggressive tightening

After many years of low inflation, the surge in inflation during the pandemic recovery came as a surprise. Key factors driving inflation included supply disruptions, high energy prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and massive monetary and fiscal stimulus that fueled spending on housing and durable goods. Inflation topped 6 percent in more than four-fifths of the world’s economies, while increasingly broad-based price gains lifted expectations for further increases to multi-decade highs.

Central banks in emerging markets responded by sharply tightening policy beginning in 2021, followed by their counterparts in advanced economies. This led to a tightening of financial conditions globally through the fall of last year. As a result, global economic growth is now expected to slow this year, with divergent views on the extent to which unemployment would likely need to rise to cool hot labor markets.

Investor optimism

Since late last year, however, financial markets have rebounded strongly on retreating energy prices and signs that inflation may have peaked. In some economies, prices for goods included in core inflation measures, such as autos and furniture, have fallen.

These signs of progress in reducing inflationary pressures amidst continued strength in labor markets have offered reason to believe that policymakers may have succeeded in taming inflation with little cost to economic growth, a so-called soft landing.

In the United States and the euro area, market-based measures of inflation one year ahead have returned to near the central banks’ 2 percent target from 6 percent last spring. Gauges for several other advanced economies have seen similar drops. In emerging markets, such market-based measures of inflation one year ahead have also been falling, albeit at a slower pace.

Expected easing

These disinflation hopes have been accompanied by growing expectations that central banks will soon not only stop tightening policy but also reduce rates fairly quickly. In many economies, this has led to yields on long-dated government debt falling below short-dated maturities. Historically, such an inversion of the yield curve often precedes recessions. Analyst assessments in fact point to significant recession risk in many economies, but the expectation is that recessions, should they occur, will be mild.

Growing expectations for lower interest rates and only a shallow economic slowdown have fueled a significant easing in financial conditions in recent months—despite central banks continuing to raise rates. Markets have reflected this relatively benign picture: stock markets have rallied, and credit spreads narrowed considerably.

Conundrum for central banks

This easing of financial conditions during a central bank tightening cycle creates a conundrum for policymakers.

On the one hand, financial markets are signaling that disinflation may occur without meaningful increases in unemployment. Policymakers could embrace that view, and in effect ratify the loosening of financial conditions. Many observers concerned that central banks will be overzealous about tightening monetary policy—and will cause an unnecessarily painful economic downturn—are endorsing such a view.

Alternatively, central banks could push back against investor optimism, emphasizing the risks that inflationary pressures may be more persistent than expected. This risk-management approach would require restrictive interest rates for longer, until there’s tangible evidence of a sustained decline in inflation.

While doing so could induce a repricing of the policy path and of risk assets in financial markets—possibly causing equity prices to fall and credit spreads to widen—there are three reasons why such an approach is needed to ensure price stability.

History shows high inflation is often persistent—and may possibly ratchet up further—without forceful and decisive monetary policy actions to reduce it.





While goods inflation has come down, it seems unlikely that the same will happen for services without significant labor-market cooling. Crucially, central banks must avoid misreading sharp declines in goods prices and easing policy before services inflation and wages, which adjust more slowly, have also moderated markedly.





Experience suggests that prolonged periods of rapid price gains make inflation expectations more susceptible to de-anchoring as such an inflationary mindset becomes more entrenched in the behavior of households and firms.

Policymakers must continue to be resolute

Central banks should communicate the likely need to keep interest rates higher for longer until there is evidence that inflation—including wages and prices of services—has sustainably returned to the target.

Policymakers will likely face pressure to ease policy as unemployment rises and inflation keeps falling. These challenges could be particularly acute for emerging market economies.

To be sure, this is an unusual period in which many special factors are affecting inflation, and it is possible that inflation comes down more quickly than policymakers envision.However, loosening prematurely could risk a sharp resurgence in inflation once activity rebounds, leaving countries susceptible to further shocks which could de-anchor inflation expectations. Hence, it is critical for policymakers to remain resolute and focus on bringing inflation back to target without delay.","(3, 'inflation')"

In a move to strengthen financial stability among its ranks, the Army is amplifying its financial readiness resources. This initiative aims to provide Soldiers and their families with comprehensive support, including access to high-quality food, financial education and free counseling services.

""With the new year upon us, it's an ideal time for our Soldiers to assess and enhance their financial health,"" said Lt. Gen. Kevin Vereen, deputy chief of staff of G-9. ""Understanding one's financial well-being is the first step toward effective budgeting and financial planning.""

The Army's financial readiness resources encompass a range of services:

Free Financial Counseling: Soldiers can access free services to assist in creating spending plans and managing personal finances, including credit and debt.

Financial Education: The Army Family Web Portal hosts a variety of computer-based courses that offer insights into consumer affairs and personal financial management.

Nutritional Assistance: Programs like SNAP and WIC provide supplemental nutrition support for eligible families.

Basic Needs Allowance: This supplemental monthly allowance supports service members with dependents who qualify.

Affordable Meal Preparation: ""Meals in Minutes"" classes teach how to prepare nutritious meals affordably. On-post dining facilities offer discounted rates for spouses and dependents of Soldiers in certain pay grades.

In emergencies, Soldiers and their families have access to financial assistance through various Army programs. Secure the Financial Frontline and the Financial Readiness Program are valuable resources for financial literacy and support.

""The Army is not just committed to the battlefield readiness of our Soldiers, but also to their financial readiness,"" said Vereen. ""Ensuring that they and their families are well-supported financially is paramount to our mission.""

In 2024, the Army plans to expand these efforts by emphasizing financial security, healthy meal options and childcare access, and by reducing barriers to military spouse employment.

Outreach and information improvement are also on the agenda, with an emphasis on encouraging Soldiers and families to seek resources like credentialed personal financial managers and counselors. These services offer free, confidential, in-person financial counseling and literacy training.

""Our Soldiers and their families are our top priority,"" said Sgt. Maj. Michael Perry, senior enlisted advisor, G-9. ""Improving their quality of life through these initiatives is essential to maintaining the strength and readiness of our Army.""

Chapter 1 analyzes the recent turmoil in the banking sector and the challenges posed by the interaction between tighter monetary and financial conditions and the buildup in vulnerabilities since the global financial crisis. The emergence of stress in financial markets complicates the task of central banks at a time when inflationary pressures are proving to be more persistent than anticipated. Smaller and riskier emerging markets continue to confront worsening debt sustainability trends. Chapter 2 examines nonbank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) and the vulnerabilities that can emerge from elevated leverage, liquidity mismatches, and high levels of interconnectedness. Tools to tackle the financial stability consequences of NBFI stress are proposed, underscoring that direct access to central bank liquidity could prove necessary in times of stress, but implementing appropriate guardrails is paramount. Chapter 3 analyzes the effect of geopolitical tensions on financial fragmentation and explores their implications for financial stability—including through potential capital flow reversals, disruptions of cross-border payments, impact on banks’ funding costs, profitability, and credit provision, and more limited opportunities for international risk diversification.

472,Financial Management: DOD Needs to Improve System Oversight - Government Accountability Office,Financial Management: DOD Needs to Improve System Oversight  Government Accountability Office,"Tue, 07 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdhby5nb3YvcHJvZHVjdHMvZ2FvLTIzLTEwNDUzOdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,Government Accountability Office,"What GAO Found

For over 30 years, the Department of Defense (DOD) has initiated a variety of efforts and undergone several changes in organizational responsibility to help modernize its business and financial systems. However, these efforts and changes have not been fully successful to date. DOD is the only major federal agency to not achieve an unmodified (clean) audit opinion—its business and financial systems are a key impediment to this effort.

Effective oversight of systems is essential to moving DOD in the right direction. Key elements of such oversight include establishing oversight processes, using and communicating quality information, sustaining leadership commitment, and managing risk.

Oversight processes. DOD has established a process for overseeing its business and financial management systems. First, systems are not to proceed into development unless the approving official determines that statutory requirements have been met. These requirements are that the system (1) has been reengineered and streamlined, and unique software requirements and interfaces minimized, (2) complies with the defense business enterprise architecture, (3) has valid, achievable requirements, (4) has an acquisition strategy designed to eliminate or reduce the need to modify commercial off-the-shelf systems, and (5) complies with the Department's auditability requirements. Second, once approved, systems proceed through an annual certification process in which DOD checks to make sure that systems are continuing to meet the requirements. However, the key guidance documents that govern DOD, military department, and defense agency decisions about initial approvals and annual certifications are limited. Specifically, the guidance does not fully address how systems are to document compliance or how decision-makers are to substantiate that systems are complying with requirements. For example, DOD-level guidance does not describe how approval authorities are to determine compliance with the auditability requirement. This places DOD at risk of making decisions based on a “check the box” exercise.

○ = Not addressed: Guidance does not discuss the requirements.

Source: GAO Analysis of Department of Defense (DOD) documentation. | GAO-23-104539

In addition, DOD does not apply key requirements to systems in sustainment, even though the statute does not provide for such an exclusion. By excluding application of these requirements, DOD may be missing important opportunities for improving these systems.

Quality information. As part of its oversight, DOD collects data about business and financial system compliance with statutory requirements. For example, of the 136 systems that indicated the auditability requirement was applicable or required, 84 indicated they were compliant with the requirement, 44 indicated they planned to comply, three indicated they were not compliant, and five indicated they had not completed an assessment.

aSystems indicated that compliance with the requirement was required or applicable.

bDOD defines legacy systems as systems that it plans to phase out over the next 36 months. It does not require legacy systems to comply with certain requirements.

cDOD does not require systems that have proceeded past the development phase (i.e., systems in sustainment) to comply with selected requirements.

However, the reliability of these data is limited. For example, of the 208 systems that DOD identified as relevant to the financial audit, information on 71 systems indicated that the auditability requirement was not applicable to them. However, a separate database indicated that at least 58 of these 71 were relevant to the audit. In addition, as of January 2022, DOD reported that its Independent Public Auditors had identified 1,411 unresolved IT-related notices of findings and recommendations associated with 3,478 underlying IT-related issues. These results raises further questions about data reliability, which may also impact the extent of compliance with statutory requirements.

Leadership. DOD has experienced frequent changes to the organizations and entities responsible for overseeing its business and financial systems. For example, in February 2018 a new Chief Management Officer position was established with broad responsibilities for business operations; three years later the position was abolished. GAO has previously reported that demonstrating sustained, consistent leadership is imperative for successful business transformations.

For example, in February 2018 a new Chief Management Officer position was established with broad responsibilities for business operations; three years later the position was abolished. GAO has previously reported that demonstrating sustained, consistent leadership is imperative for successful business transformations. Managing risk. Officials from across DOD provided their perspectives on risks and challenges facing the department as it seeks to modernize its financial system environment. These include legacy systems, system interfaces, and human capital. DOD has taken a number of steps to address risks and challenges identified by DOD officials. GAO will continue monitoring DOD's efforts in this area.

In addition, DOD is not taking a strategic approach to managing the human capital needed for its financial management systems. It does not, among other things, analyze the gaps in capabilities between existing staff and future workforce needs, or formulate strategies for filling expected gaps. As a result, as discussed in the report, challenges have emerged.

Why GAO Did This Study

DOD spends billions of dollars each year on its business and financial systems. However, DOD's business systems modernization and financial management efforts have been on GAO's high risk list since 1995. These high risk areas remain obstacles to DOD's efforts to achieve an unmodified audit opinion.

GAO was asked to review DOD's financial management systems. This report (1) describes DOD's efforts to improve its business and financial systems; (2) assesses the extent to which DOD is effectively overseeing its business and financial systems; and (3) assesses the extent to which DOD is taking a strategic approach to managing human capital for its financial management systems.

To describe DOD's efforts to improve its business and financial systems, GAO reviewed related laws, GAO reports, and DOD and military department documentation associated with DOD's business and financial systems.

To assess DOD's oversight of these systems, GAO reviewed reports, guidance, and relevant statutes to identify key elements of business and financial management systems oversight. GAO evaluated DOD policy and DOD, military department, and defense agency guidance and plans against statutory requirements for oversight. It also evaluated DOD's data on its systems' compliance with statutory requirements associated with improving the department's ability to obtain an unmodified audit opinion.

GAO also evaluated DOD and military department guidance and plans against key practices for workforce management. In addition, it interviewed relevant officials from DOD and the military departments","(4, 'national debt')"

These platforms increasingly resemble traditional banking and payment systems that facilitate the storage and exchange of billions of dollars in assets, including virtual currencies. However, consumers report being harmed by scams or theft on gaming platforms and not receiving the protections they would expect under federal law. The CFPB will be monitoring markets where financial products and services are offered, including video games and virtual worlds, to ensure compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws.

“Americans of all ages are converting billions of dollars into currencies used on virtual reality and gaming platforms,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. “As more banking and payments activity takes place in video games and virtual worlds, the CFPB is looking at ways to protect consumers from fraud and scams.”

The report, Banking in Video Games and Virtual Worlds, looks at the growing use and scale of these assets across the gaming industry, the associated risks to consumers, and the evolution of games and virtual worlds into online marketplaces. American consumers spent nearly $57 billion on gaming in 2023, including on hardware, software, and in-game transactions such as converting dollars to virtual currencies or other gaming assets. These assets are often bought, sold, or traded in virtual markets that allow gaming companies to replicate everyday activities online, including financial payments.

The report identifies a number of trends and risks associated with gaming assets, including:

Gaming products and services resemble conventional financial products: Games and virtual worlds enable players to store and transfer valuable assets, including in-game currencies and virtual items such as cosmetic skins or collectibles. For example, the largest reported sale of a cosmetic skin was for $500,000. Games and virtual worlds act as a real-world marketplace that enables players to store and transfer valuable assets. To leverage that value, gaming companies have begun incorporating financial products and services such as proprietary payment processors and money transmitters.

To leverage that value, gaming companies have begun incorporating financial products and services such as proprietary payment processors and money transmitters. Gaming companies provide little customer support when consumers experience financial harm : The increased value of in-game assets has fueled a rise in scams, phishing attempts, and account thefts. Attackers use phishing tactics or compromised user credentials to break into accounts and access game currency or virtual items, and then sell these assets off the platform for other currency. Consumers report having little recourse with gaming companies when they suffer losses, and game publishers claim to have no obligation to compensate the players for financial losses, including when service to a game is suspended or a consumer’s account is closed.

Gaming companies are assembling gamers’ personal and behavioral data: Publishers are collecting large amounts of data on players, including behavioral details such as financial data, purchasing history and spending thresholds. Gaming platforms can also track players’ location data, which can generate an accurate portrait of a player’s daily routines, such as their home address, places of employment or worship, and health and medical status. And with the advent of virtual- and mixed-reality gaming, the information gathered by headsets may include biometric data such as iris scans, eye movement, pupil response, and gait analysis, which may pose medical privacy risks.

The CFPB has received consumer complaints about hacking attempts, account theft, and lost access to gaming assets. In the complaints, most consumers report receiving limited support from the gaming companies, such as reimbursements or security improvements. Existing consumer protection laws apply to banking and payment systems that facilitate the storage and exchange of valuable assets. The CFPB is monitoring markets where financial products and services may be offered, including video games and virtual worlds.

Financial Literacy

The IRSC Center for Financial Literacy’s mission is to provide financial literacy educational programs, activities and materials to assist students and the community in making informed financial decision-making.

A study by the Program for International Assessment showed that 15-year-old American students ranked 6th among their counterparts in 19 countries in financial literacy (PISA, 2018). Almost 18% of American students cannot perform basic financial literacy tasks (Lusardi, 2015). College graduates lack basic financial literacy in issues of spending, use of debit and credit cards, budgeting, debt management and saving (Farrington, 2014).

The IRSC Center for Financial Literacy provides activities and essential tools and resources to prepare students to improve their financial decision-making to enable them to achieve long-term financial stability while promoting critical thinking in applied contexts to assist them in succeeding in their academic pathways. This purpose is parallel to IRSC’s commitment to develop a highly skilled workforce and cultivate student success.

When financial crises occur, they can have far-reaching effects. They can deepen economic downturns, trigger capital flight, and lower exchange rates. They can disrupt financial intermediation and undermine monetary policy. They can have large fiscal costs that come from rescuing troubled financial institutions. Because financial institutions and countries are increasingly connected, financial shocks in one area can quickly spill across financial sectors and national borders.That makes resilient, well-regulated, and well-supervised financial systems essential for economic and financial stability.

Full Text

The April 2018 Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR) finds that short-term risks to financial stability have increased somewhat since the previous GFSR. Medium-term risks are still elevated as financial vulnerabilities, which have built up during the years of accommodative policies, could mean a bumpy road ahead and put growth at risk. Higher inflation may lead central banks to respond more aggressively than currently expected, which could lead to a sharp tightening of financial conditions. Valuations of risky assets are still stretched, and liquidity mismatches, leverage, and other factors could amplify asset price moves and their impact on the financial system. Emerging markets have generally improving fundamentals, but could be vulnerable to sudden tightening of global financial conditions. Banks have strengthened their balance sheets since the crisis, but parts of the system face a structural US dollar liquidity mismatch that could be a vulnerability. Crypto assets have features that may improve market efficiency, but they could also pose risks if used with leverage or without appropriate safeguards. Policymakers and investors must remain attuned to the risks of rising interest rates and higher market volatility. Central banks should continue to normalize policy gradually and communicate clearly, while policymakers should address vulnerabilities by deploying and developing macroprudential tools. This GFSR also examines the short- and medium-term implications for downside risks to growth and financial stability of the riskiness of corporate credit allocation. It documents the cyclical nature of the riskiness of corporate credit allocation at the global and country levels and its sensitivity to financial conditions, lending standards, and policy and institutional settings. Another chapter analyzes whether and how house prices move in tandem across countries and major cities around the world—that is, global house price synchronicity. The chapter finds a striking increase in house price synchronization across the countries and cities. It also finds that global financial conditions contribute to this synchronization, which suggests that policymakers should be alert to the possibility that shocks to house prices elsewhere may affect housing markets at home.","(4, 'national debt')"

We saw it earlier this year, as turbulence in the banking sector precipitated three questions: Are banks’ risk management practices strong enough? Is prudential regulation adequate? Is banking supervision effective, or can it be improved?

The making of good supervision

While much attention is typically devoted to the needed upgrading of regulations following episodes of bank distress, upgrading of supervisory effectiveness can be left bereft of corresponding attention—despite our analysis consistently showing that it is key to banking and financial stability.

In a new paper, Good Supervision: Lessons from the Field, we reflect on the lessons learned from the recent bank turmoil in the United States and Switzerland and review progress made across countries in delivering effective supervision, drawing on the IMF’s surveillance and capacity building work of the past 10 years.

Good supervision might be thought of as a construction site—where design, material, and skill all come together to culminate in a resilient structure. Supervisors require operational independence to carry out their tasks free of outside pressures, along with accountability. They need a clear mandate to ensure they are focused on the right trouble spots. And they need adequate legal powers to back their actions. Sufficient resources, appropriate skillsets, and the application of sound judgment and deep analysis based on accurate situational awareness of the outlook, risks, and vulnerabilities, are also vital to supervisors taking timely and conclusive action.

The global financial crisis had highlighted the importance of supervisors needing to be assertive and intrusive, that is, demonstrating the will and ability to act. The 2012 update of the global standards for banking supervision—the Basel Core Principles—raised expectations for supervisors take account of economic and business trends, as well as the build-up and concentration of risks inside and outside the banking sector. “Light touch” supervision, often invoked as part of efforts to encourage economic activity and foster competition, had proved unsuccessful—institutional and systemic distress had followed in its wake, with the blame inevitably placed, after the fact, on the absence of intrusive and timely supervisory effort.

Progress, but a long road ahead

First the good news. Our review found much progress in risk monitoring and analysis across advanced, emerging, and developing countries, with many of them having incorporated forward-looking supervisory approaches, in some cases harnessing data-intensive and technology-driven tools.

Wider adoption of stress tests has also been a great advance. These tools help broaden supervisors’ views of threats facing individual banks, the banking sector, and the financial system, beyond the historical data and past experiences. Likewise, business model analysis has become integral to supervisory frameworks in many countries, helping flag vulnerabilities early on and convey these in their dialogue with banks.

But in key respects, progress on supervision has not been sufficient. Our findings show that more than half of the jurisdictions do not have independent bank supervisors with a clear safety and soundness mandate, with sound internal governance, or with resources appropriate to their assigned responsibilities. Deficiencies also remain in supervisory approaches, techniques, tools, and (use of) corrective and sanctioning powers.

As a result, undertaking timely action based on supervisory findings continues to be a challenge. The ongoing structural evolution of the financial sector, such as the growth of nonbank financial intermediation, the digitalization of finance, and climate change, adds to supervisory challenges and makes these weaknesses even more relevant.

Higher bar for good supervision

Bringing supervision up to the task at hand requires action on four important fronts:

Take a more systematic approach to requiring banks to go beyond quantitative regulatory thresholds and prudential rules when business and macro-financial risks are high.

Overcome the tendency to under-allocate resources and attention to all but the largest of banks, as vulnerabilities at smaller banks can also trigger or amplify adverse systemic impact.

Ensure that trained and experienced supervisors are available and can focus attention on governance, business models, and risk management at banks.

Develop internal processes for decision making and escalation of actions that are clear and effective.

But efforts by supervisors alone will not be sufficient.

Banks and Trust Companies

Banks, also known as commercial banks, are community, regional or national for-profit business corporations owned by private investors and governed by a board of directors chosen by stockholders. Banks are generally institutions focused on commercial lending to help finance business and other ventures but are also involved in unsecured lending or lending secured by items other than real estate (i.e. credit cards or inventory loans).

A Trust Company is an entity that is authorized by the Superintendent to exercise fiduciary (trust) powers. A trust may be a stand-alone entity or be part of a bank. These companies provide a number of fiduciary responsibilities. The ""trust"" name refers to the ability of the institution to act as a trustee – someone who administers financial assets on behalf of another.

In the case of a Limited Purpose Trust Company, the application process generally receives the same level of scrutiny as other bank and trust companies with two exceptions: the minimum level of capitalization and the requirement for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance. The basic restriction on limited purpose trusts is the prohibition on receiving deposits and making loans except as incidental to the exercise of fiduciary powers. DFS charters and regulates banks and trust companies under Article III of the Banking Law. Such Limited Purpose Trust Companies are, in some cases, authorized by DFS to engage in virtual currency-related activity.

Budget Planners

A budget planner is a non-profit corporation that enters into a contract with a debtor under which the debtor agrees to pay a sum of money periodically to the budget planner, which the budget planner distributes among the debtor’s creditors. A budget planner also provides credit counseling and financial education. Section 456 of the General Business Law prohibits budget planning by anyone other than a non-profit corporation. Budget planners are licensed by and have their fees approved by the DFS under Article XII-C of the Banking Law.

Charitable Foundations

Some banks in the U.S. are organized as mutual companies. A mutual company is one that is owned, and sometimes governed, by its members instead of being owned by public or private shareholders. In the case of a mutual savings bank or a mutual savings association, the members are the financial institution’s depositors.

When a mutual company converts to a stock form of ownership, it may establish a private charitable foundation expected to provide funds to support charitable causes and community development activities. The foundation may be funded by the sponsoring institution with cash, common stock or other property and is established as a separate legal entity, though it may be closely tied to the sponsoring corporation through an interlocking board of directors and staff. Such foundations must apply for tax-exempt status at both the state and federal levels. Contributions by the corporation to the charitable foundation are tax deductible for federal tax purposes over a certain period with deductions generally limited to a certain percent of taxable income in any one year. These charitable foundations are subject to examination by the DFS. The Community and Regional Banks Division is responsible for the examination and supervision of these foundations.

Check Cashers

A check casher is a person or entity whose primary business is the cashing of checks, drafts or money orders for a fee.

A check casher license is not required when a person or entity cashes checks, drafts or money orders for free, or when the person or entity cashes checks, drafts or money orders as an incident to the conduct of another lawful business (e.g. a store) and not more than $1.00 is charged. New York State strictly regulates the check cashing industry, from setting limits on the amount that can be charged for cashing a check to regulating how close together facilities can be located.

Check cashers are licensed by the Superintendent of Financial Services under Article IX-A of the Banking Law.

Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies

A consumer credit reporting agency (CCRA) is a company that assembles or evaluates and maintains consumer credit information for the purpose of providing reports to third parties that bear on consumers’ credit worthiness, credit standing, or credit capacity. Part 201 of Title 23 of the Official Compilation of Codes, Rules, and Regulations of the State of New York provides the official definition of a CCRA, and requires CCRAs that, within the preceding 12-month period, have assembled, evaluated, or maintained a consumer credit report on one thousand or more New York consumers to register with DFS.

Credit Unions

A credit union is a non-stock corporation (i.e. a membership corporation) whose members must either have a common employer or be members of the same trade, industry, profession, club, union, society or other association. Credit unions may accept deposits from, make loans to, and issue credit cards to their members, among other things. The Banking Law also provides for an entity called a corporate credit union, whose members are primarily other credit unions.

Credit unions are regulated under Article XI of the Banking Law. New York state-chartered credit unions are also regulated by the National Credit Union Administration, which also insures credit union share accounts up to certain limits.

Domestic Representative Offices

A national bank or a bank chartered in another state, wishing to establish a presence in New York State in order to conduct certain business activities may choose to register a Domestic Representative Office with the Superintendent. A representative office can also be an office of a New York state-chartered institution located outside the New York that engages in representational functions. Domestic Representative Offices may only engage in certain functions on behalf of the institution such as approving loans, executing loan documents, soliciting loans (including assembling credit information, property inspections and appraisals, securing title information, preparing loan applications, solicitation loan servicing) soliciting banking business on behalf of the institution, conducting research and acting as liaison with customers of the institution.

Domestic representative offices are not branches and cannot engage in general banking transactions at their representative offices. They may not disburse funds, transmit funds, accept loan repayments, or accept deposits on behalf of the banking institution.

Foreign Agencies

A Foreign Agency of a Foreign Banking Organization (“FBO”) is licensed by the Superintendent to conduct banking business in New York and has many of the same powers as a Foreign Branch, except in the case of deposits. A Foreign Agency, in accordance with Section 202-a of the Banking Law, may issue large-denomination obligations over a specified amount, may accept deposits other than from citizens or residents of the United States, and may maintain credit balances for customers incidental to its banking business.

Foreign Agencies are covered under Article V of the Banking Law. Since 1991, they have also been subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve Board.

Foreign Branches

A Foreign Branch of an FBO is licensed by the Superintendent to conduct banking business in New York. A Foreign Branch may exercise the same powers as a state-chartered commercial bank, including accepting deposits, making loans, issuing letters of credit, dealing in foreign exchange, making acceptances and, if authorized, exercising fiduciary powers. A Foreign Branch can be insured or uninsured; an uninsured Foreign Branch may accept deposits only as authorized by the FDIC.

Foreign Branches are covered under Article V of the Banking Law. Since 1991, they have also been subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. Since passage of the FDIC Foreign Bank Supervision Enhancement Act in 1991, no new insured Foreign Branches have been licensed.

Foreign Representative Offices

A Foreign Representative Office of an FBO is licensed by the Superintendent to conduct research on the U.S. market and engage in marketing for the FBO. A Rep Office is not permitted to perform any core banking functions for the FBO or make any business decisions that would obligate the FBO, but it is permitted to engage in a number of activities not deemed to constitute the business of banking, including acting as liaison with customers and correspondents of the FBO, soliciting new business for the FBO, soliciting investors to buy loans from the FBO, and soliciting loans of $250,000 or more for the FBO.

Foreign Representative Offices are covered in Article V-B of the Banking Law. Since 1991, they have also been subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve Board.

Health Insurers

The Department is responsible for regulating the following types of health insurers: accident and health; non-profit health services, medical expense indemnity, dental expense indemnity corporations and health maintenance organizations (HMOs). In addition, the Department regulates health insurance products issued by fraternal benefit societies, municipal cooperative health benefit plans and continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs).

The Department oversees the solvency of these companies, corporate and marketplace conduct, and compliance with the Insurance Law and regulations. The Department conducts periodic financial and market conduct examinations of these companies; reviews and approves health insurance premium adjustments; reviews and approves new rates and filings; and issues legal interpretations of contract language for health insurance, including Disability Benefits Law (DBL) coverage and continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs).

Holding Companies

A bank holding company is an entity (or natural person) that owns 10% or more of the voting stock, or otherwise controls, two or more New York banks or trust companies or national banks whose principal offices are located in New York State. Regulation of bank holding companies under Article III-A of the Banking Law is designed to prevent undue concentration of bank ownership. Consequently, unlike the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates all holding companies, even if they control only one bank, the Department does not regulate one-bank holding companies.

An insurance holding company is an individual or entity who directly or indirectly controls any authorized insurer. Control is presumed to exist if an individual or entity directly or indirectly owns, controls, or holds, with the power to vote, 10% or more of the voting securities of an authorized insurer. The Department regulates holding companies under Insurance Law Article 15 and 11 NYCRR 80-1 (Insurance Regulation 52). Regulation of insurance holding companies is designed to prevent indiscriminate over-concentration of economic power and to forestall potential abuses that could harm controlled insurers.

Investment Companies (Article XII)

An Article XII Investment Company is a specialized non-depository lending institution that has broad borrowing and lending powers and may invest in stocks and bonds. An Article XII Investment Company is not an “investment company” subject to registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

An Article XII Investment Company may accept credit balances in New York that are incidental to the exercise of its other powers and may accept deposits outside New York with the approval of the Superintendent. Article XII Investment Companies may specialize in commercial or retail sales finance; others are involved in domestic and international commercial and merchant banking.

Licensed Lenders

A licensed lender is an entity engaged in the business of making loans in the principal amount of $25,000 or less to any individual for personal, family, household, or investment purposes, or $50,000 or less for business and commercial loans, at a rate of interest greater than 16% a year.

Licensed lenders are covered in Article IX of the Banking Law.

Life Insurance Companies

The Department is responsible for regulating the financial condition, market conduct activities, corporate conduct and administration of the Insurance Law for the following types of insurers: life insurance companies, life insurance departments of savings banks, public pension funds, fraternal benefit societies, retirement systems, charitable annuity societies, life settlement companies and union welfare funds.

The Department conducts annual reviews of reserves; issues certificates of reserve valuation; reviews actuarial opinions and memoranda; audits minimum statutory formula reserves; reviews rates and actuarial aspects of life insurance and annuity policy forms; reviews reserve procedures for separate account plans of operation; reviews applications for the creation of continuing care retirement communities; conducts legal reviews and evaluations of life insurance and annuity contracts, reviews related policy forms and life settlement contracts; and drafts regulations and proposed legislation in connection with life insurance policies and annuity contracts.

Money Transmitters

A money transmitter is a business that issues and sells traveler’s checks and money orders, and transmits money on behalf of the public by any means including transmissions within this country or abroad by wire, check, draft, facsimile or courier. Generally, a money transmitter markets its services through a network of agents.

Money transmitters are regulated and licensed under Article XIII-B of the Banking Law.

Mortgage Bankers

A mortgage banker is a person or entity that engages in the business of making three or more mortgage loans in one calendar year or five or more mortgage loans in any two year period (other than certain exempt entities, including a banking organization and an insurance company.

Mortgage bankers are subject to licensing by the Superintendent of Financial Services under Article XII-D of the Banking Law.

Mortgage Bankers-Exempt

Certain entities that engage in mortgage lending or mortgage brokering are exempt from the licensing and registration requirements of the Banking Law. These organizations are subject to the disclosure and other regulations regarding one to four family owner occupied residential mortgages. Additionally, the Superintendent has the authority to examine these institutions. Bona fide non-profit organizations are eligible for exemption.

Mortgage Brokers

A mortgage broker is a person who solicits, processes, places or negotiates a mortgage loan, but does not include a real estate broker or salesman, as defined in section 440 of the Real Property Law, if he does not directly or indirectly accept a fee for services rendered in connection with such solicitation, processing, placement or negotiation.

Mortgage brokers are subject to registration by the Superintendent of Financial Services under Article XII-D of the Banking Law.

Mortgage Brokers - Inactive

Inactive mortgage brokers are brokers that are prohibited from soliciting, processing or negotiating mortgage loans for 1-4 family residential property in New York.

Mortgage Loan Originators

Mortgage loan originator means an individual who, for compensation or gain or in the expectation of compensation or gain takes a residential mortgage loan application or offers or negotiates terms of a residential mortgage loan. The term does not include any individual engaged solely in loan processor or underwriter activities (as described in the statute), except if the individual is working as an independent contractor of an originating entity, certain individuals who are real estate brokers or an individual engaged in extensions of credit for timeshare plans. They are subject to a criminal background check and must complete certain educational requirements.

Article 12-E of the New York Banking Law, which went into effect on July 11, 2009, requires all individuals (with limited exceptions) who engage in the business of a mortgage loan originator with respect to New York residential real estate, to obtain a license from the Superintendent of Financial Services . The New York State DFS uses the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System (NMLS) as the initial step in the Mortgage Loan Originator license application process. The NMLS can also be used to renew, amend or surrender an existing license. (NMLS itself does not grant or deny license authority.)

Mortgage Loan Servicers

A mortgage loan servicer is any person or entity in the business of servicing residential mortgage loans. Servicing includes receiving any scheduled periodic payments from a borrower pursuant to the terms of any mortgage loan, including amounts for escrow accounts, and making payments to the owner of the loan or other third parties of principal and interest and such other payments with respect to the amounts received from the borrower as may be required pursuant to the terms of the mortgage loan documents or servicing contract. In the case of a home equity conversion mortgage or reverse mortgage, servicing includes making payments to the borrower.

Exempt Mortgage Loan Servicers are loan servicers that are exempt from registering with the Superintendent but intend to service mortgages in the state. The statute makes such firms subject to New York State conduct of business rules.

New York State Regulated Corporations

New York State Regulated Corporations are business entities that are formed and incorporated by the State of New York through legislative acts and placed under the regulatory supervision of the Superintendent.

Pharmacy Benefit Managers

Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) are third party companies that function as intermediaries between insurers and pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmacies. PBMs often create formularies, negotiate rebates (discounts paid by a drug manufacturer to a PBM) with manufacturers, process claims, create pharmacy networks, review drug utilization, and manage mail-order and specialty pharmacies.

PBMs are regulated and licensed under Insurance Law Article 29 and Section 280-a of the Public Health Law.

Premium Finance Agencies

A premium finance agency enters into premium finance agreements with an insured person or acquires premium finance agreements from insurance agents or brokers or other premium finance agencies. A premium finance agreement is an arrangement under which a premium finance agency or an insurance broker or agent advances funds to an insurance company to pay an insurance premium on behalf of the insured and receives repayment by the insured over a period of time.

Under Article XII-B of the Banking Law, the DFS licenses premium finance agencies and regulates the terms of the finance agreement.

Private Bankers

A Private Bank is a bank owned by an individual or a partnership. A Private Bank may engage in most commercial and investment banking activities. Accepting of deposits is subject to certain restrictions and limitations.

Private Bankers are covered under Article IV of the Banking Law.

Property and Casualty Insurance Companies

The Department regulates the financial condition, corporate conduct and administration of the Insurance Law for the following types of property and casualty insurers: fire and marine, casualty and surety, title, financial guaranty and mortgage guaranty. The Department also regulates policy forms and rates for these types of insurance, and monitors and investigates insurers' market conduct practices.

Safe Deposit Companies

A safe deposit company acts as a custodian for storage of personal property and papers of any kind. It may also engage in the safe deposit business by renting vaults and safe deposit boxes. It cannot lend money or make advances on any property left in its possession. Safe Deposit Companies and the safe deposit business are covered in Articles VIII and VIII-A of the Banking Law.

Sales Finance Companies

A sales finance company acquires retail installment contracts, obligations or credit agreements made by other parties. The term includes a retail car dealer who holds retail installment contracts acquired from retail buyers, which have aggregate unpaid time balances of $25,000 or more. The term also includes a person who enters into retail installment credit agreements with retail buyers under Section 413(11) of the Personal Property Law.

Sales finance companies are licensed and regulated under Article XI-B of the Banking Law.

Savings Banks and Savings & Loan Associations (S&L)

Savings Banks are also known as thrifts. A savings bank is a financial institution whose primary purpose is accepting savings deposits. It may also perform some other functions. Savings Banks are community, regional or national for-profit business corporations owned by private investors and governed by a board of directors chosen by stockholders. Historically, savings banks were organized as mutual companies.

Thrift is a blanket term that was historically used to describe savings and loan associations, savings banks and savings associations to differentiate them from “commercial banks” Thrifts are traditionally focused on residential lending and promoting home ownership and thus to qualify as a thrift, must issue a certain volume of loans secured by residential real estate, whereas a commercial bank's focus was traditionally on business accounts and commercial lending. Thrifts are regulated under Article VI of the Banking Law.

A Savings & Loan or “S&L” is also a thrift. Historically, savings and loan associations were organized as stock companies and typically were local or regional in nature, focusing on the needs of a community of residential customers. S&Ls are regulated under Article X of the Banking Law and must have a certain percent of assets in residential mortgage and mortgage securities. Though historically there was a difference in the types of products and services that savings banks and commercial banks could offer to the public, many of these products and services are now offered by both, however commercial banks and savings banks (or thrifts) remain under the supervision of different regulatory bodies.

Service Contract Providers

A service contract provider is any person or entity who sells or administers a service contract, and who is contractually obligated to provide service under the service contract. In New York, a service contract is a contract or agreement, for a separate or additional consideration and for a specific duration, to perform the repair, replacement or maintenance of any kind of property, or indemnification for the repair, replacement or maintenance of property, due to a defect in materials or workmanship or wear and tear. Although a service contract may cover any kind of property, some of the most common kinds of property covered by service contracts include motor vehicles, personal electronics, computers, home appliances and certain residential plumbing, heating, cooling, ventilation, and electrical system components. A Service Contract Provider must register with and obtain approval from the Superintendent prior to selling any service contracts in New York.

Virtual Currency Businesses

Virtual currency businesses are businesses that receive virtual currency for transmission or transmit virtual currency, store, hold, or maintain custody or control of virtual currency on behalf of others, buy and sell virtual currency as a customer business, perform exchange services as a customer business or control, administer, or issue a virtual currency.

Virtual currency businesses are licensed and regulated in New York under 23 NYCRR Part 200.","(5, 'stock market')"

Money laundering is a necessary component of the organized crime that too frequently spans borders, skirts taxes, funds terrorism and corrupts officials—and it comes with hefty macroeconomic costs. Bad actors are also embracing new technologies on top of their traditional techniques, all of which makes economic growth less inclusive and sustainable, fueling inequality and informality.

The international community has made significant progress toward strengthening safeguards against money laundering and terrorist financing, with help from the IMF and other organizations. We decided a decade ago to take a more bespoke approach to identifying key risks, working with member countries and international partners, particularly, the Financial Action Task Force, the international standard-setter in this area.

But the overall efforts are still broadly insufficient. For example, as the FATF noted last year, there is still a major gap between progress countries have made on technical compliance, such as enacting new laws, and on the effectiveness of these efforts. For example, very little laundered ill-gotten proceeds are ever confiscated.

Accordingly, the IMF recently reviewed our strategy on anti-money laundering and combatting the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). The goal is to better help our 190 member economies address these critical financial integrity issues.

High costs

We must first recognize that financial crime affects lives and livelihoods, especially those of the most vulnerable, and that the costs it imposes are very high—and increasing. Direct costs vary and can include lower revenues, higher expenditures, sanctions, lost banking services, and even increased financial instability.

For example, and as recent IMF work has shown in the Nordic Baltic Region, AML/CFT deficiencies are associated not only with large drops in stock prices for the most directly affected banks, but also declines in share prices of other lenders who simply happen to be in the same country, as well as banks in the region that have similar cross-border exposures.

The indirect costs are even greater because they are imposed across an economy, whether by fueling boom-and-bust cycles or making home prices unaffordable. Potential financial stability impacts include bank runs and lost foreign investment. Large-scale money laundering can even spur volatility in international capital flows, undermine good governance, spark political instability, and just generally erode trust—in governments and institutions.

Liquidity, as measured by deposit flows, tends to deteriorate around financial integrity events for the affected bank while other domestic banks’ liquidity could benefit from positive substitution effects in the short-term.

Another important consideration is that illicit financial flows are a global problem. Insufficient AML/CFT frameworks in some countries, including international financial centers, can attract criminal proceeds from abroad. In countries exporting illicit flows, we see there is less opportunity, higher inequality, higher poverty, more illegal immigration, misused resources, and environmental degradation. For example, one study shows that illicit financial flows in Africa (an estimated $1.3 trillion since 1980 has left sub-Saharan Africa) drain domestic revenues that could be used for the continent’s development, have a strong and negative effect on investment rates, notably private investment, and are curtailing Africa’s savings rate. These effects can also have a cascading effect on countries transiting or receiving the illicit proceeds.

This underscores why we must better understand how money laundering and terrorist financing can hurt individuals, countries, and even the global economy. And because of the wide-ranging consequences, we are deepening AML/CFT considerations across all the work that we do, while urging our members to safeguard their financial sectors and broader economy to help ensure global financial stability.

Deeper understanding

Analysis of money laundering and terrorist financing historically focused on threats and vulnerabilities. Both are central to gauging and containing risks, but more is needed. Knowing the full extent of consequences for economies requires being able to understand the fiscal, monetary, financial sector and structural costs of illicit flows. This is needed to document just how financial integrity affects both a given country’s financial stability and broader economy, plus how global financial stability might be affected.

Accordingly, the IMF Executive Board has endorsed a plan for the institution to expand its data analytics capacity to focus on these issues and deepen the coordinated approach across all of our key work areas, including IMF surveillance, lending engagements, capacity development and Financial Sector Assessment Programs. This new approach will also give the IMF new evidence to answer key questions including:

Which sectors are most vulnerable for money laundering, from banks and real estate to virtual assets and precious metals?

What countries export illicit flows, allow them to transit, and what countries integrate them?

How do these illicit flows affect the economy, including its prospects for inclusive and sustainable growth and development?

Even after decades of progress in financial integrity, the Fund and the international community must persist and press on in this fight. Crime is a moving target, but we can—and must—broaden and deepen our containment efforts. This includes improving cooperation among stakeholders, including governments, international bodies, and civil society. For our part, the IMF will use its strength as a macroeconomic institution with global reach to help its members assess the impact of financial crimes and illicit flows and design and implement policies to address them. The cost of failure is simply too high.

493,2021 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households - FDIC,2021 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households  FDIC,"Mon, 24 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZkaWMuZ292L2FuYWx5c2lzL2hvdXNlaG9sZC1zdXJ2ZXkvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,FDIC,"The financial disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic created unique opportunities and challenges for economic inclusion, some of which may be temporary, while others may be longer lasting. The importance of quickly receiving income from Economic Impact Payments or other government relief programs created a unique bankable moment, and consumers benefitted from enhanced online and mobile account opening technologies and the greater availability of safe and affordable bank accounts. This combination of factors resulted in meaningful gains in connecting households to the banking system.

Health and safety concerns regarding in-person interactions during the pandemic may have accelerated the long-term trend of increasing use of mobile and online channels to access financial products and services, such as mobile banking and online payment services. As the pandemic wanes, it will be important to carefully monitor whether the shift from in-person activity continues, stabilizes, or subsides.

Beyond impacts directly tied to the pandemic, the financial services marketplace continues to become more disaggregated, and consumers are bundling services and providers (bank and nonbank) in new and interesting ways. This disaggregation may provide greater choices for consumers but also may make it more difficult for consumers to clearly distinguish differences between bank and nonbank products and to understand the protections available, such as deposit insurance. The economic inclusion implications of disaggregation on different segments of the population bear further research and highlight the need to learn more about how consumers are navigating the choices presented to them by the evolving marketplace.

The pandemic highlighted the need for consumers to quickly respond to economic shocks, particularly to ensure that they were able to receive and access relief funds and other benefits. Community organizations, policymakers, and bankers raised awareness about Economic Impact Payments and connected consumers to bank accounts. For example, the FDIC launched a national #GetBanked consumer education campaign and collaborated with the U.S. Department of the Treasury to help consumers connect to banks that offered online opening of safe and affordable accounts so that they could establish a banking relationship and receive stimulus payments more quickly and securely. The 2021 survey provides strong evidence that receipt of income, such as stimulus payments, unemployment benefits, and employment income, was an important motivator for account openings. Among recently banked households that received a government benefit payment, almost half said that the payment contributed to opening an account. And among recently banked households that started a new job, one in three said that the new job contributed to opening an account. These results are consistent with 2013 findings that showed that the most common reason recently banked households opened an account was to receive direct deposit. Together, these findings provide compelling evidence of the effectiveness of focusing on bringing people into the financial mainstream when they are receiving funds. Economic inclusion efforts should continue to focus on connecting consumers with safe and affordable accounts at a variety of bankable moments, for example, with receipt of new employment income, tax refunds, and government benefits and transfers. While initiatives to bank consumers at opportune moments have existed for some time (e.g., Bank On, Volunteer Income Tax Assistance site banking efforts), more options are available today than in the past to connect consumers with safe and affordable bank accounts. As of September 2022, over 250 banks and credit unions offer an account that meets Bank On National Account Standards. In addition, mobile and online account opening options are more accessible. Restrictions on in-person activities during the pandemic led many banks to enhance their digital account opening technologies to make it easier and quicker for consumers to open accounts remotely through online and mobile banking. At the same time, consumer comfort and familiarity with financial technology increased as many consumers used online and mobile methods for shopping or handling their finances. Public awareness campaigns timed with bankable moments highlighting account opening options could be helpful for bringing consumers into banking. In addition to expanding access to banking, maintaining sustainable banking relations is a key economic inclusion consideration. The pandemic tested the sustainability of banking relationships when labor market disruptions reduced or curtailed many household income streams. In 2021, about one in five recently unbanked households (21.1 percent) reported that losing or quitting a job, being furloughed, having reduced hours, or having a significant loss of income contributed to closing a bank account in the prior 15 months. As sizeable as this share is, it is much lower than results reported in a past FDIC survey. Although not directly comparable, in 2013, one-third (33.9 percent) of recently unbanked households experienced a significant income loss or a job loss that they said contributed to the household becoming unbanked. Government aid and financial system flexibilities during the pandemic likely played a role in mitigating consumer financial distress, particularly in helping consumers meet their credit obligations. But it would be beneficial to identify lessons learned regarding communication strategies, staff training, or bank policies that were particularly effective in helping consumers and financial institutions navigate financial disruptions. For example, at the start of the pandemic, regulators encouraged financial institutions to work with consumers, especially LMI consumers, and to consider measures to reduce the financial impact of the pandemic, such as waiving early withdrawal penalties for time deposits or ATM fees. It is important to explore whether these or other efforts were effective and could be continued to help LMI consumers cope with short-term financial shocks without becoming unbanked.

An example of how consumer use of financial providers has been shifting over time is the long-term trend of declining use of the nonbank financial products and services covered by the survey. For the most commonly used nonbank financial transaction services, usage has fallen significantly. In 2021, the share of households that used nonbank money orders and nonbank check cashing in the past year was half of what it had been in 2011. Check cashing use fell from 7.9 percent in 2011 to 3.2 percent in 2021, while money order use fell from 18.8 percent to 9.7 percent. These declines have persisted across bank account ownership and demographic groups. Significant drops have been seen among both the highest- and lowest-income households. For example, the use of nonbank money orders among households with less than $15,000 in income dropped from 30.8 percent to 19.4 percent between 2011 and 2021, while it fell from 10.2 percent to 5.1 percent among households with income of $75,000 or more. Among some groups, use of nonbank financial services declined considerably between 2019 and 2021; for example, unbanked households' use of nonbank check cashing fell from 39.9 percent in 2011 to 31.9 in 2019, and dropped to 21.8 percent in 2021. Impacts from the pandemic may have played a role in accelerating changes in consumer financial services choices. Similarly, nonbank credit use has also declined. In 2013, 7.5 percent of households used at least one of the nonbank credit products tracked by the survey at that time: rent-to-own services and payday, pawn shop, tax refund anticipation, and auto title loans. But in 2021, the share of households using those same products fell by 40 percent to 4.4 percent. The decline was particularly pronounced among unbanked households; nearly one in five unbanked households (18.2 percent) used at least one of these nonbank credit products in 2013, but fewer than one in ten (9.5 percent) did so in 2021. Decreasing use of these nonbank services, especially through a period of declining unbanked rates, could imply that a growing number of households is fulfilling financial services needs within the banking system and benefiting from the consumer protections and opportunities that the system provides. However, to understand whether the decline in observed use of nonbank financial services correlates with greater inclusion in banking, more information is needed about whether and how households have replaced nonbank products and services like money orders and check cashing. It is also important to think about household attitudes, characteristics, and usage patterns when assessing how and why financial habits are changing. For example, while it may be reasonable to consider that unbanked households that were using nonbank services but were very interested in having a bank account may have curtailed their use of nonbanks in favor of banks, a significant portion of unbanked households do not trust banks, and it is less likely that these households are shifting from nonbanks to banks. The declines in observed nonbank financial service use may also reflect a change in demand among consumers driven by changing needs. In some cases, consumers may simply no longer need a service. For example, the overall decline in the use of paper checks has been well documented and could explain why some households no longer use check cashing services. Potential drivers of the long-term decline in demand for nonbank credit are less clear, but it is likely that changes in economic conditions, policy changes, and shifts in prevailing attitudes about the nonbank credit products mentioned in the survey affected demand. On the supply side, the rapidly changing marketplace has led to a proliferation of new nonbank financial products, and some households may be turning to these new products as they become available. Providers like nonbank fintechs and online payment services offer new ways to conduct core financial transactions such as receiving income (e.g., new ways to cash checks virtually), while emerging credit options such as buy now, pay later products provide new alternatives to existing credit offerings inside and outside of the banking system. To the extent that households have replaced existing nonbank financial services with new nonbank products, there may be consumer protection concerns. Also, banks may need to better target their economic inclusion strategies to align with changes in consumer behavior. Learning more about how households use new and existing bank and nonbank services will help clarify the true extent to which consumers are transacting within or outside of the banking system. As the diversity of options available in the marketplace grows, financial services are becoming more disaggregated as banked and unbanked households alike may increasingly turn to separate providers to meet different needs. As households combine bank and nonbank products in new ways, banks may need to work harder to distinguish themselves from nonbank providers and demonstrate the unique value and protections they offer consumers. The research community, including the FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households, should strive to ensure adequate coverage of emerging products and to better understand how consumers are evaluating their options. Knowing more about the full range of services that households are using and the reasons motivating their choices will also allow economic inclusion stakeholders to better gauge the status of their efforts to develop, promote, and connect consumers to appealing banking products and can inform ways to evolve this work going forward.","(4, 'national debt')"

The journey has been eventful, starting with supply-chain disruptions in the aftermath of the pandemic, an energy and food crisis triggered by Russia’s war on Ukraine, a considerable surge in inflation, followed by a globally synchronized monetary policy tightening.

Global growth bottomed out at the end of 2022, at 2.3 percent, shortly after median headline inflation peaked at 9.4 percent. According to our latest World Economic Outlook projections, growth this year and next will hold steady at 3.2 percent, with median headline inflation declining from 2.8 percent at the end of 2024 to 2.4 percent at the end of 2025. Most indicators continue to point to a soft landing.

We also project less economic scarring from the crises of the past four years, although estimates vary across countries. The US economy has already surged past its prepandemic trend. But we now estimate that there will be more scarring for low-income developing countries, many of which are still struggling to turn the page from the pandemic and cost-of-living crises.

Resilient growth and rapid disinflation point toward favorable supply developments, including the fading of energy price shocks, and a striking rebound in labor supply supported by strong immigration in many advanced economies. Monetary policy actions have helped anchor inflation expectations even if its transmission may have been more muted, as fixed-rate mortgages became more prevalent.

Despite these welcome developments, numerous challenges remain, and decisive actions are needed.

Inflation risks remain

Bringing inflation back to target should remain the priority. While inflation trends are encouraging, we are not there yet. Somewhat worryingly, progress toward inflation targets has somewhat stalled since the beginning of the year. This could be a temporary setback, but there are reasons to remain vigilant. Most of the good news on inflation came from the decline in energy prices and in goods inflation. The latter has been helped by easing supply-chain frictions, as well as by the decline in Chinese export prices. But oil prices have been rising recently in part due to geopolitical tensions and services inflation remains stubbornly high. Further trade restrictions on Chinese exports could also push up goods inflation.

Economic divergences widen

The resilient global economy also masks stark divergence across countries.

The strong recent performance of the United States reflects robust productivity and employment growth, but also strong demand in an economy that remains overheated. This calls for a cautious and gradual approach to easing by the Federal Reserve. The fiscal stance, out of line with long-term fiscal sustainability, is of particular concern. It raises short-term risks to the disinflation process, as well as longer-term fiscal and financial stability risks for the global economy. Something will have to give.

Growth in the euro area will rebound but from very low levels, as past shocks, and tight monetary policy weigh on activity. Continued high wage growth and persistent services inflation could delay the return of inflation to target. However, unlike in the United States, there is little evidence of overheating, and the European Central Bank will need to carefully calibrate the pivot toward monetary easing to avoid an inflation undershoot. While labor markets appear strong, that strength could prove illusory if European firms have been hoarding labor in anticipation of a pickup in activity that does not materialize.

China’s economy remains affected by the downturn in its property sector. Credit booms and busts never resolve themselves quickly, and this one is no exception. Domestic demand will remain lackluster unless strong measures address the root cause. With depressed domestic demand, external surpluses could well rise. The risk is that this will further exacerbate trade tensions in an already fraught geopolitical environment.

Many other large emerging market economies are performing strongly, sometimes benefiting from a reconfiguration of global supply chains and rising trade tensions between China and the US. These countries’ footprint on the global economy is increasing.

Policy path

Going forward, policymakers should prioritize measures that help preserve or even enhance the resilience of the global economy.

The first such priority is to rebuild fiscal buffers. Even as inflation recedes, real interest rates remain high and sovereign debt dynamics have become less favorable. Credible fiscal consolidations can help lower funding costs, improve fiscal headroom and financial stability. Unfortunately, fiscal plans so far are insufficient and could be derailed further given the record number of elections this year.

Fiscal consolidations are never easy but it is best not to wait until markets dictate their conditions. The right approach is to start now, gradually, and credibly. Once inflation is under control, credible multiyear consolidations will help pave the way for further monetary policy easing. The successful 1993 US fiscal consolidation and monetary accommodation episode comes to mind as an example to emulate.

The second priority is to reverse the decline in medium term growth prospects. Some of that decline comes from increased misallocation of capital and labor within sectors and countries. Facilitating faster and more efficient resource allocation will boost growth. For low-income countries, structural reforms to promote domestic and foreign direct investment, and to strengthen domestic resource mobilization, will help lower borrowing costs and reduce funding needs. These countries also must improve the human capital of their large young populations, especially as the rest of the world is aging rapidly.

Artificial intelligence also gives hope for boosting productivity. It may do so, but the potential for serious disruptions in labor and financial markets is high. Harnessing the potential of AI for all will require that countries improve their digital infrastructure, invest in human capital, and coordinate on global rules of the road.

Medium-term growth prospects are also harmed by rising geoeconomic fragmentation and the surge in trade restrictive and industrial policy measures. Trade linkages are already changing as a result, with potential losses in efficiency. The net effect could well be to make the global economy less, not more, resilient. But the broader damage is to global cooperation. It is still time to reverse course.

Third, a great achievement of the past few years has been the strengthening of monetary, fiscal and financial policy frameworks especially for emerging market economies. This has helped make the global financial system more resilient and avoid a permanent resurgence of inflation. Going forward, it is essential to preserve these improvements. That includes protecting the hard-won independence of central banks.

Lastly, the green transition requires major investments. Cutting emissions is compatible with growth and activity has become much less emission-intensive in recent decades. But emissions are still rising. Much more needs to be done and done quickly. Green investment has expanded at a healthy pace in advanced economies and China. The greatest effort must now be made by other emerging market and developing economies, which must massively increase their green investment growth and reduce their fossil fuel investment. This will require technology transfer by other advanced economies and China, as well as substantial private and public financing.

On these questions, as well as on so many others, multilateral frameworks and cooperation remain essential for progress.

499,Five Things to Watch in the 2023 North Carolina Economy - NC.gov,Five Things to Watch in the 2023 North Carolina Economy  NC.gov,"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbW1lcmNlLm5jLmdvdi9uZXdzL3RoZS1sZWFkLWZlZWQvZml2ZS10aGluZ3MtdG8td2F0Y2gtMjAyMy1ub3J0aC1jYXJvbGluYS1lY29ub2150gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,NC.gov,"Author: Neil Harrington & Josh Levy

By many measures, North Carolina’s economy performed well in 2022, placing the state on strong economic footing going into 2023. There were potential signs of cooling near the end of the year, but, overall, labor market and economic conditions remained strong. As LEAD continues to monitor the state’s labor market and economy this year, here are five indicators and trends we are paying especially close attention to in 2023.

1. Will record employment growth continue?

As most observers of the economy will tell you, 2022 was a great year for job growth in North Carolina. With a net increase around 190,000 jobs (+4 percent), last year was the best year for employment growth in the state in over 30 years.[1] But month-over-month job growth did slow near the end of 2022, which begs the question of whether such solid job growth is sustainable into 2023. If the Federal Reserve can engineer a soft landing—effectively slowing inflation without causing a recession—as many analysts and economists increasingly see as possible, slow, steady employment growth in 2023 could continue. However, if a recession occurs in 2023, it could actually reverse the growth trends we saw in 2022. Of course, other factors will also influence employment in 2023 such as the availability of jobseekers to fill open positions, global geopolitical conflicts, and disease outbreaks, among other factors.

2. Will strong wage growth persist in 2023 and continue outpacing inflation?

Average hourly wages among private employers in North Carolina showed strong growth in 2022, continuing trends from the preceding two years. Of course, inflation reduced the real value of wages earned by workers in the state and across the country, but growth in worker earnings outpaced price increases through much of 2022. Wage growth in lower wage sectors has been especially strong, which is welcome news for workers who often feel the impact of inflation the most.

Strong wage growth has largely been driven by tight labor market conditions and the supply of labor lagging employer demands. In every month last year, there were more job openings than jobseekers in North Carolina, and these two indicators were roughly equivalent through much of 2021 as well. This has forced employers to increase wages more rapidly than they might otherwise to attract workers. The overall health of the economy will likely determine the degree of imbalance between labor supply and demand in 2023. If North Carolina and the country’s economy continue humming along without a recession, wage growth for workers and hiring struggles for employers may persist. But labor market conditions could reverse in the event of a recession, especially a serious downturn, which could dampen wage growth. In any event, labor market tightness, wage growth, and inflation are certainly trends to keep an eye on in 2023.

3. Can low rates of unemployment, including for historically disadvantaged populations, be maintained?

In 2022, North Carolina’s unemployment rate dipped below its pre-pandemic rate for the first time since the initial detection of COVID-19 in the US. The unemployment rate for all workers averaged 3.6 percent during the year and dipped as low as 3.4 percent during some months, near the historical low point in North Carolina. Strong demand for workers helped fuel low unemployment rates. If the economy and labor market continue cooling off in 2023 as began to happen at the end of last year, the unemployment rate could begin increasing more rapidly, especially if the country slips into a full-fledged, deep recession. However, some estimates suggest a mild recession may shield unemployment from spiking too considerably.

Tight labor market conditions have also delivered gains for population groups such as racial minority and rural workers. The annual average unemployment rates for Black and Hispanic or Latino workers in 2022 were 2.7 and 6.1 percentage points, respectively, lower than 2020 levels.[2] However, the 6.8 percent Black unemployment rate remains more than double the rate of White workers. Additionally, 29 counties had lower average annual unemployment rates in 2022 than any year since 1990, all of which were rural counties. If past recessions are any indication, Black, rural, and other historically marginalized workers could see unemployment rates start increasing in the wake of an economic downturn.

4. Will strong population growth in North Carolina continue?

North Carolina is the 9th largest state in the US with 10.6 million people and added 133,000 people from July 1, 2021 to July 1, 2022, according to the US Census Bureau. Among states, this was the third largest increase in sheer numbers, following Texas and Florida. In percentage terms, the state was the 9th fastest growing in the nation. North Carolina’s population increase of 1.3 percent was higher than the average annual change over the preceding decade, but lower than the average annual growth rate in the 2000s. About 75 percent of 2022’s population gain was due to migration from other states, while international migration contributed roughly 20 percent.

5. North Carolina’s labor market is projected to shift toward occupations with higher typical education requirements. What will 2023 bring?

LEAD’s most recent round of projections, covering 2021 to 2030, anticipates jobs requiring more education to grow at the fastest rates, but still expects more than half of 2030’s jobs will typically not require more than a high school diploma. Between 2021 and 2030, LEAD projects North Carolina will add 445,729 net jobs, or about an average of 49,500 jobs per year. However, projections are not meant to be linear and net job growth will vary year-to-year based on larger economic conditions. LEAD will keep an eye on employment changes in 2023, the occupations in which growth or loss occurs, and unlikely or unforeseen events like massive technological breakthroughs, which could all affect employment trajectories through the rest of the decade.","(1, 'employment/wages')"

Meanwhile, total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation was 0.4% in September, increasing 3.4 percent over the past twelve months. Core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was 0.3 percent in September and is up 3.7 percent over the past year.

A year ago, financial news outlets were reporting that the market expected an imminent recession. One declared that the probability of a U.S. recession within 12 months was 100 percent. Almost a year to the day later, the Wall Street Journal reported that according to its own survey research, “Economists are turning optimistic on the U.S. economy. They now think it will skirt a recession…” In fact, over the last four quarters, real GDP has grown at a healthy 2.9%, far surpassing the consensus 0.2% growth projected last year, shown in the first two bars in the chart.

Consumption spending makes up two-thirds of the U.S. economy on average, so as the U.S. consumer goes, so goes the U.S. economy. The second set of bars shows that the biggest surprise in the performance of the economy since this time last year has been that the US consumer has continued spending robustly: real consumption spending grew almost 2 percentage points more than expected at this time last year (2.4% vs. 0.5%).

This was driven in part by the remarkably strong labor market: Unemployment remained very low at 3.7 percent in Q3, far lower than the 4.4 percent expected (third set of bars). The strong job market performance was buoyed by expanded labor supply. Indeed, prime-aged labor force participation rate hit a 20-year high. The tight labor market produced large income gains for American households, with disposable income growing by 3.8 percent (instead of the forecasted 1.4 percent (fourth set of bars).

The roughly $11.6 trillion per year in aggregate real compensation received by U.S. workers is a function of both their real hourly compensation and their aggregated hours of work. In this regard, the 14 million jobs created since President Biden took office not only have provided opportunities and greater bargaining clout to working Americans, but also have played a key role in boosting aggregate spending, which drives positive growth outcomes that have led to the correction in the market’s recession calls.

And this is seen very clearly in Figure 2 which shows the tight fit between labor market earnings and consumer spending by plotting the relationship between the year-over-year percent change in aggregate compensation and aggregate spending, adjusted for inflation. The figure uses data from the mid-1960s through 2019 to avoid the sharp disruption to both variables from the pandemic. The correlation of 0.79 quantifies this very simple, but close, relationship, one which roughly predicts that if we continue to see real income gains for workers, we can expect continued healthy growth in consumer spending.

Falling inflation is another crucial piece of the equation. Overall CPI inflation is down 60% from its peak in June of 2022; and recently in Q3, core PCE inflation—the gauge tracked closely by the Federal Reserve—was 2.4% (annual rate). The slowdown in inflation amidst the strong job market is one reason why real wages are rising on a year-over-year basis for the past five months, as shown by the green and blue lines compared to the black line in the chart below. Nevertheless, inflation needs to fall further still to support household budgets, strengthen the buying power of workers’ paychecks, and continue to support consumption and GDP growth.

Another important factor boosting GDP growth over the last year has been President Biden’s investment agenda. This has pulled in hundreds of billions in private capital, much of which is going towards building American factories to support clean energy and semiconductor production. Returning to the last set of bars in the first figure up top, private non-residential business investment was far stronger over the last year than expected by forecasters (growth 3.7% versus a forecasted 0.2%).

Going forward, while the tailwind from consumer spending is helping to boost the current expansion, such investments will continue help to boost future growth, domestic job creation, and U.S.-based productive capacity.

Every economy faces tailwinds and headwinds, but in the face of many strong headwinds, the U.S. economy has proven to be consistently resilient. The American consumer, backed by a persistently tight labor market and recently rising real wages, is one salient force behind this economic resilience.","(0, 'GDP')"

Governor's Office

HELENA, Mont. – Governor Greg Gianforte today announced Montana’s economy grew an inflation-adjusted 6.7% in 2021, the seventh largest rate of growth in the country. It also marks the sharpest rate growth in Montana in more than 40 years. Montanans’ personal income also grew by 8.5% in 2021, the fastest increase in 15 years.

“Thanks to hardworking Montanans, our state had an economic boom last year, despite inflation and the pandemic. Montanans’ earnings increased at the fastest rate in 15 years, and we’re producing more than we have in near two generations. The Last Best Place is a great place to live, work, raise a family, and do business,” Gov. Gianforte said.

According to economic data released this month by the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), Montana’s real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 6.7% in 2021, well above the U.S. growth of 5.7%. Real GDP is the inflation-adjusted value of the goods and services produced by labor and property located in a given area.

Montana’s total GDP was $59.3 billion in 2021 in current dollars.

By industry, the sector with the largest GDP was the finance and real estate industry, with $11.2 billion in current dollars. The largest contributor to the overall gain in real GDP was the professional and business services industry, with gains in 2021 of more than $575 million over its 2020 level. Finance and manufacturing also posted large increases in the value of output produced.

The strongest recovery was posted in the leisure activities industry, which includes hotels, restaurants, ski resorts, museums, and many tourism activities that were hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Growth in these businesses surged in 2021 by 22% over 2020.

New economic data from BEA also revealed Montana’s per capita personal income grew by 8.5% in 2021, faster than the U.S. growth of 7.4%. The 8.5% increase marks the largest increase in Montana’s per capita personal income since 2006.

Earlier this month, the governor announced Montana’s unemployment rate in March fell to a record low of 2.3%, the fourth lowest rate in the nation. Montana’s labor force and total employment also reached record highs in March.

Since Gov. Gianforte was elected in November 2020, Montana’s unemployment rate has dropped from 4.2% to 2.3%, and nearly 26,000 jobs have been created in the state.

Justina Gallegos, Deputy Director for Industrial Innovation, Office of Science and Technology Policy



In 2021 and 2022, President Biden signed into law his Investing in America agenda, a series of strategic public investments in industries critical for the long-run economic growth of the United States. This included the largest investment in reducing carbon emissions in American history. The clean energy investments in the agenda—primarily in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act—include incentives for manufacturing across the clean energy supply chain, investments in demonstration projects, loans and loan guarantees for a variety of technologies, and production and investment tax credits for clean energy generation. This suite of public sector tools provides unprecedented investment certainty to the private sector, with several provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act extending over a decade.

The most recent available data indicate that the President’s agenda has supported robust investment in the construction of manufacturing facilities and strong performance in key targeted industries including solar and wind energy, grid energy storage, and electric vehicles.

This brief highlights progress-to-date towards deploying these clean energy technologies. It describes how the President’s Investing in America agenda is translating into tangible outcomes and progress towards the President’s climate goals, and it outlines how the deployment of clean energy technologies will lower greenhouse gas emissions, improve energy security, and spur economic growth.

Investment in the construction of clean energy manufacturing facilities is exceeding expectations

As explained in a recent issue brief, the Investing in America agenda is intended to catalyze strategic private sector investments, and initial signs indicate that private companies are already responding. Since January 2021, private companies have announced over half a trillion dollars in new investment, including nearly $360 billion in clean energy manufacturing, EVs and batteries, and power generation.

One of the first ways these private clean energy investments will be visible in the economic data is through the construction of manufacturing facilities. Indeed, since President Biden took office, inflation-adjusted spending on the construction of manufacturing facilities has nearly doubled. This increase has exceeded forecasters’ expectations, suggesting that the Investing in America agenda is catalyzing more private sector funding than initially expected (Figure 1).

This growth in the construction of manufacturing facilities is strong relative to growth in other forms of construction. For example, inflation-adjusted manufacturing construction spending increased by 27 percent in the first ten months of 2023. Meanwhile, other types of non-residential construction grew 7 percent over the same period (Figure 2).

The Investing in America agenda is driving clean energy deployment

Other data sources indicate that the public clean energy investments in the President’s Investing in America agenda will translate into unprecedented private sector clean energy deployment in the coming years. In many cases, the acceleration is much faster than forecasters had previously anticipated.

Clean energy deployment

A central goal of the Investing in America agenda is to increase the amount of energy generated from clean sources like solar and wind, which will lower energy costs, improve energy resilience, and cut greenhouse gas emissions. Near-term investments in manufacturing, coupled with incentives like tax credits, are intended to reduce the costs of deploying clean energy at scale.

There has already been notable progress towards expanding U.S. solar and wind manufacturing capacity. Since the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in August 2022, over 100 gigawatts of planned manufacturing capacity have been announced for solar module assembly—which would produce enough solar panels per year to power more than 10 percent of U.S. homes. These announcements represent 79 new facilities and/or expansions and more than $13 billion in investment.

As the manufacturing base expands, solar and wind deployment are projected to grow rapidly—considerably faster than projections before the Investing in America agenda was signed into law. According to the latest Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) forecast[1] from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the United States is on track to have 338 gigawatts of solar capacity in 2030—nearly twice the capacity forecasted in the beginning of 2021 (Figure 3).[2] Likewise, for wind energy capacity, the latest AEO forecast estimates that the United States will have 300 gigawatts of wind turbine capacity in 2030, a 43 percent increase from their 2021 projection (Figure 4). For context, this estimated capacity from solar and wind in 2030 would be roughly double the total existing renewable capacity on the grid at the end of 2022.

Grid-scale energy storage deployment

Energy storage is another essential component of a clean electricity grid. Battery storage—either via grid-scale battery systems or an aggregation of smaller batteries in a virtual power plant—enables companies to store excess electricity from wind and solar energy and put that energy back on the grid when it is needed the most, helping to reduce total energy costs.

To grow the amount of energy storage on the grid, incentives from the President’s Investing in America agenda are spurring historic private deployment of large-scale energy storage capacity. Thanks to cost declines in battery energy storage, in just one year, grid-connected battery energy storage is on track to more than double. It is expected to nearly double again in 2024 (Figure 5). The latest forecasts, following the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, show a dramatic expansion in capacity for grid-scale battery storage, far outpacing previous estimates (Figure 6). As of August 2023, grid-storage battery capacity is ahead of even this 2023 estimate.

Electric vehicle sales

The large-scale adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) can lower energy costs, improve air quality, cut emissions pollution, and reduce noise pollution. Throughout the United States, it is cheaper to charge a vehicle using electricity than to fill it with gasoline. The average EV in the United States produces fewer emissions than the average new gasoline-powered vehicle, even when accounting for the current electricity mix of the U.S. grid. The Inflation Reduction Act is projected to double the share of clean electricity generation by 2030, further lowering the total carbon footprint of current and future electric vehicles as the grid becomes cleaner.

To reap the benefits of this technological innovation, the Investing in America agenda includes a range of incentives designed to support the EV industry. This includes investments to support EVs and EV battery manufacturing, funding to build a national network of EV chargers, and consumer tax credits to lower the cost of purchasing an EV. Private sector companies have begun to respond to these incentives. Since the beginning of 2021, firms have announced over $150 billion in investments to manufacture EVs and EV batteries. New EV models are also offering consumers more options. Between 2021 and the second quarter of 2023, the number of EV models increased from 34 to 55, with 14 new EV models in the last year alone.

EV sales have risen rapidly during this period from roughly 20,000 sales per month in 2020 and 2019 to over 90,000 per month in 2023 (Figure 7). At the start of 2023, forecasters estimated that beginning in 2026, more than one million EVs would be sold each year, and by 2030, nearly 1.8 million EVs would be sold—more than five times the forecast in 2021 (Figure 8). Actual sales have surpassed these forecasts. More than one million EVs have already been sold in 2023—three years ahead of the projections made earlier this year and 18 years ahead of the projections made in the beginning of 2021.

Clean energy deployment builds a better economy for Americans

Manufacturing and deploying clean energy technologies enables the United States to move faster towards the Biden-Harris Administration’s climate goals. Meeting these goals means reducing the impacts of climate change by cutting emissions, improving energy security and reliability, and spurring equitable economic growth. Some of these investments are spread out over a decade, meaning many of the associated benefits will accrue over time. Forecasters’ estimates preview some of these benefits to come.

First, more rapid deployment means more rapid progress towards preventing and mitigating the impacts of climate change. According to the most recent U.S. government forecast, U.S. emissions could fall nearly twice as much by 2030 compared to before the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law were in place. To the extent that deployment is indeed faster than originally anticipated, these emissions projections would improve even more.

Second, deploying clean energy can improve U.S. energy security and reliability while lowering energy prices. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the share of electricity from clean sources in 2030 could grow to 80 percent—nearly twice the expected amount before the Inflation Reduction Act passed. Strong growth in domestic clean energy industries supports energy security, reliability, and supply chain resiliency while creating good jobs. Deploying more clean electricity sources will provide opportunities to increase energy system reliability and security by reducing overreliance on traditional fuel sources alone. Increased long-duration energy storage capacity can also reduce outages and improve energy reliability. Meanwhile, new technologies like virtual power plants and other distributed energy resources can improve overall grid reliability. Similarly, the transition to electric vehicles can reduce U.S. consumers’ exposure to macroeconomic shocks from oil price volatility.

Third, investments in clean energy can contribute to long-term broad-based economic growth. In the aggregate, strong investments in manufacturing construction are contributing to GDP growth (Figure 9). In the latest data, private manufacturing facility construction contributed 0.3 percentage points to the total 3.0 percent real four-quarter growth. This means manufacturing construction accounted for roughly 10 percent of all GDP growth over the year, the largest annual contribution to GDP growth since the U.S. government began collecting these data in 1959.

In the long-run, these investments in clean energy are likely to pay for themselves in terms of the benefits accrued. According to a recent analysis, a dollar of spending on clean energy generates roughly twice as much in output as a dollar in spending on fossil fuel energy. A more recent working paper estimates that the production tax credit in the IRA will boost U.S. GDP by lowering the cost of electricity, meaning it generates more benefits than it is expected to cost—without even counting the benefits from reduced carbon emissions and air pollution.

Conclusion

In order to meet the Biden-Harris Administration’s ambitious climate goals, the United States needs to deploy clean energy at an unprecedented scale. To lower emissions across sectors like power generation and transportation, there is a need for generational investments in not only clean power generation but also related technologies like grid-scale energy storage and electric vehicles.

President Biden’s Investing in America agenda responds to this need with carefully designed incentives to mobilize private sector investments, including in clean energy technologies. At the macroeconomic level, there is already strong evidence that private sector commitments are translating into tangible construction projects to build new manufacturing facilities.

In critical clean energy industries, the latest available data indicate that the Investing in America agenda is enabling the United States to outpace previous projections of the rate at which the country would move towards its clean energy goals. Current data suggest the United States is moving rapidly towards a clean energy economy, even faster than many forecasts—both forecasts prior to the enactment of the President’s agenda and, for some technologies, forecasts immediately after the enactment of the agenda—had anticipated.

Ultimately, these investments will improve the economic and social wellbeing of Americans. Greater manufacturing capacity and deployment of clean energy, energy storage, and electric vehicles translate into lower greenhouse gas emissions, improved energy security and reliability, lower costs, and stronger economic growth in the long run.

Together, these latest data show that the President’s Investing in America agenda is already generating benefits—economic and otherwise—to the American people. Looking ahead, the latest forecasts suggest these investments are mobilizing more activity than previously anticipated, putting the United States even closer towards its goals of addressing climate change, promoting energy security, and generating steady, stable economic growth.

With immigration dominating politics and voter concerns, BU economist’s research shows immigration boosts local wages and that having neighbors of foreign descent can reduce prejudice

Tarek Hassan, a BU College of Arts & Sciences professor of economics, has found that an influx of immigrants can energize local economies and wages—but that not everyone benefits equally. Immigration Do Immigrants and Immigration Help the Economy? With immigration dominating politics and voter concerns, BU economist’s research shows immigration boosts local wages and that having neighbors of foreign descent can reduce prejudice

When Americans mark their presidential election ballots later this year, immigration will be top of mind—it’s the nation’s number one issue, according to pollster Gallup. And one of the toughest talkers on the topic is former president and presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump. He’s built his political career on calls to secure the border and defend America against what he says are immigration’s dangers, warning of shrinking wages and stretched benefits programs. “When you have millions of people coming in,” he recently told a crowd in Michigan, “they’re going to take your jobs.”

Immigrants stealing work from existing residents is a well-worn contention—with a history stretching back at least 100 years right up to present-day accusations that Tyson Foods could replace American workers with immigrant labor. But it’s also a false one, according to Boston University economist Tarek Hassan, whose recent studies have shown immigrants actually help fuel local economies by sparking innovation and driving up wages. The effects of a migrant influx can last for decades, too, enhancing a region’s attractiveness to foreign investors and opening long-term export opportunities, even 100 years later. Oftentimes, when immigrants move into an area, so do native workers, drawn by the promise of an invigorated economy.

In one recent paper, Hassan, a BU College of Arts & Sciences professor of economics, also showed that living near people from other countries can shift native views on people of foreign descent, decreasing hostility and prejudice, while boosting empathy and knowledge. Residents who live alongside those people may also be less likely to vote for political candidates who demonize them.

But there are important details that complicate the picture—at least from an economics perspective. Hassan’s research has shown that not everyone benefits the same way from a rush of migration, and that may strike a chord with some of the millions of voters who want to stem the tide. Despite the overall positive effects to a community, the flow of new residents does nothing to boost the wages of existing workers who don’t have a high school diploma. And the education and skill level of migrants matters, too: more education equals a more positive economic effect.

“The headline finding is that immigrants are good for local economic growth and, in particular, educated migrants are doing a lot of that,” says Hassan. “At the same time, the data point to why some people might have problems with this. It’s a lopsided story where the immigration we’ve experienced in the last 40 years has been disproportionately benefiting the more educated local population. We’re trying to add some facts to the debate.”

Immigration’s Impact on Economic Growth

Hassan’s family story is one of migration—of crossing borders and navigating shifting national boundaries. “I come from a family with a rather complex migration history,” says Hassan. His father was an immigrant to Germany from Egypt, his mother a refugee from East to West Germany. Hassan was raised in Germany, but moved to the United States for graduate school and has now lived here for nearly 20 years. “You have to go back many generations to find somebody who was actually born in the same country they died in,” he says of his family. “But I think that’s true for a large chunk of the population.”

He admits he finds the national debate on immigration frustrating. “There’s very little interest in nuanced information—on both sides of the debate. There’s this view among some people that all immigration is good and should be encouraged, and there’s this other view that all immigration is terrible. There’s not much interest in listening to each other.”

With his research, he hopes to foster a more informed conversation.

In a working paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research, Hassan and his colleagues examined decades of US migration data to look at the impact of new arrivals on economic growth, wage levels, and innovation, which they measured through the number of new patents filed in a particular area. More new ideas, he says, generally means more new businesses and products: “We find that when you have 10,000 extra immigrants arriving in a given US county, the number of patents filed per capita in that county dramatically increases, by something like 25 percent.” It was an effect that rippled out as far as 150 miles. The research team also estimated that, since 1965, migration of foreign nationals to the US may have contributed to an additional 5 percent growth in wages. They’re currently preparing the findings for journal publication.

“More immigrants creates more economic growth,” says Hassan. “And because it creates more economic growth locally, it raises the wages of the people who are already there.”

More immigrants creates more economic growth. And because it creates more economic growth locally, it raises the wages of the people who are already there.

In an earlier paper, Hassan had looked at migration’s impact over an even longer term: 100 years or more. With an international research team, he studied how the pull of one area for migrants from the same country could help attract foreign investment to that region for years afterward.

“You can still see today that places where Germans settled within the Midwest 100 years ago are much better at attracting foreign investment from Germany than places that didn’t see that migration,” says Hassan. The same is true for communities that had a concentration of Chinese or Polish migration, for example. “Ethnic diversity in that sense is really good for the ability of local firms to conduct business abroad, to both receive and make foreign investments.”

Immigration Fears

But what about those whose wages aren’t getting an upgrade or who—to quote Trump—fear a wave of immigrants may threaten their way of life, bringing in “languages that nobody in this country has ever heard of” or “poisoning the blood of our country”?

“On average, the people who are most scared of immigration are typically the people who don’t actually live in very ethnically diverse places,” says Hassan.

In a study published in the American Economic Review in February, Hassan and his fellow researchers investigated how having neighbors of foreign descent, specifically Arab Muslims, shaped prejudices and attitudes. They surveyed more than 5,000 Americans about their contact with Arab Muslims and knowledge of Islam, and sifted through data on migration, charitable donations, implicit prejudice, and support for Trump and the so-called “Muslim ban.” Hassan and his colleagues found that living among a large Arab Muslim population decreased prejudice, reduced support for policies targeting Arab Muslims, and increased knowledge of Islam and Arab Muslims—it even resulted in people making more donations to charities supporting their neighbors’ ancestral countries.

“Long-term exposure to people with a given ethnic background makes you more informed about them, maybe makes you like them more,” says Hassan. “It also increases political support for concerns these minorities might have. It traces a lot of xenophobia to people who don’t interact with people with foreign ancestry.”

But he says his findings on which immigrants spark the biggest economic impact, and which domestic workers benefit from that boost, should perhaps prompt a discussion about where to focus immigration policies. President Joe Biden has suggested expanding access to family-based immigration, for example, but that might not be the best economic choice, according to Hassan.

“One thing to think about, particularly given our findings about the effects of high- versus low-skilled migration,” he says, “is whether it’s worth having a debate about how much of migration should be family-based versus skill-based.”



Hassan’s National Bureau of Economic Research working paper was published with Konrad Burchardi of Stockholm University, Thomas Chaney of University of Southern California, Stephen Terry of University of Michigan, and Lisa Tarquinio (CAS’11, Pardee’11, GRS’21) of Western University; the paper on migrants and foreign investment was published with Burchardi and Chaney; and the American Economic Review paper was published with Leonardo Bursztyn of University of Chicago, Chaney, and Aakaash Rao of Harvard University.","(1, 'employment/wages')"

Pierre‑Olivier is going to start with some opening remarks, and then we are going to proceed to take your questions. I want to remind everyone that this briefing is on the record and that we also have simultaneous interpretation. With that, Pierre‑Olivier, the floor is yours.

Mr. Gourinchas: Thank you, Jose. Good morning, everyone. The global economy continues to display remarkable resilience with growth holding steady and inflation declining, but many challenges still lie ahead. Global growth was 3.2 percent in 2023 and is expected to remain at that level both in 2024 and 2025. This represents a 0.3 percentage point upgrade from our October objections for 2024, with stronger activity than expected in the U.S., China, and other large emerging markets, but weaker activity in the Euro Area.

Inflation continues to come down. Median inflation will decline from 4 percent at the end of last year to 2.8 percent by the end of this year and 2.4 percent at the end of 2025, and most indicators continue to point to a soft landing.

A resilient growth and rapid disinflation are consistent with favorable supply developments, including the fading of energy price shocks and a striking rebound in labor supply, supported by strong immigration in many advanced economies.

We also project less economic scarring from the crisis of the past 4 years, although estimates vary across countries. The U.S. economy has already surged past its pre‑pandemic trend, but we now estimate there will be more scarring for low‑income developing countries, many of which are still struggling to turn the page from the pandemic and cost‑of‑living crisis.

Risks are now broadly balanced. On the downside, new price spikes from geopolitical tensions, persistent core inflation, or a disruptive turn towards a fiscal adjustment could slow activity. On the upside, faster disinflation or timely structural reforms that boost productivity could support activity. Insufficient action on the fiscal front could also stimulate growth, although this could force a more costlier adjustment later on.

Inflation trends are encouraging, but we are not there yet. Somewhat worryingly, progress towards inflation targets has stalled since the beginning of the year in some countries. This could be a temporary setback, but there are reasons to remain vigilant. Oil prices have been rising in part due to geopolitical tensions and services inflation remains stubbornly high in many countries. Further trade restrictions could also push up goods inflation. Bringing inflation back to target should remain the priority. There are stark divergences also between countries that call for careful calibration of monetary policy. The strong recent performance of the United States reflects robust productivity growth and growth in labor supply, but also strong demand pressures that could add to inflation. This calls for a cautious and gradual approach to easing by the Federal Reserve.

By contrast, growth in the Euro Area will rebound this year but from very low levels. Unlike in the United States, there is little evidence of a hot economy, and the European Central Bank will need to carefully calibrate the pivot towards monetary easing.

China’s economy remains affected by the downturn in its property sector. Domestic demand will remain lackluster unless strong measures address the root cause and monetary policy can afford to be more accommodative.

Going forward, policymakers should prioritize measures that help preserve or even enhance the resilience of the global economy. A key priority is to rebuild fiscal buffers, especially in an environment with high real interest rates, modest growth, and elevated debts. Unfortunately planned fiscal adjustments are often insufficient and could be derailed further given the record number of elections this year.

In the United States, the fiscal stance is out of line with long‑term fiscal sustainability. This raises short‑term risks to the disinflation process, as well as longer‑term fiscal and financial stability risks for the global economy. Fiscal consolidations are never easy, but it is best not to wait until market dictate their conditions.

Credible fiscal consolidations can help lower funding costs, improve fiscal headroom and financial stability. The key is to start early, gradually, and credibly. This will also pave the way for further monetary policy easing to support activity.

The second priority is to reverse the decline in medium‑term growth for low‑income countries. Structural reforms should promote domestic and foreign investment and increase fiscal revenues. This will help lower borrowing costs and reduce funding needs. These countries must also improve the human capital of their large, young populations, especially as the rest of the world is aging rapidly.

Artificial intelligence also gives hope for boosting productivity. It may do so, but the potential for serious disruptions in labor and financial markets is high, and the right infrastructure and regulations are needed.

Third, global growth prospects are also harmed by rising geo‑economic fragmentation. Trade linkages are already changing. Some economies could benefit from the reconfiguration of global supply chains, but the net effect may still be a loss of efficiency, making the global economy less, not more resilient, and the broader damage is to global cooperation.

A great achievement of the past few years has been the strengthening of monetary, fiscal, and financial policy frameworks, especially for emerging market economies. This has helped make the global financial system more resilient and avoid a permanent resurgence in inflation. Going forward, it is essential to preserve these improvements, and that includes protecting the hard‑won independence of central banks.

Lastly, the green transition requires major investments. Cutting emissions is compatible with growth, but emissions are still rising, so more needs to be done and done quickly. This will require technology transfers by other advanced economies and China to weather emerging and developing economies, as well as substantial private and public financing.

On these questions, as well as many others, multilateral frameworks and cooperation remain essential for progress. Thank you.

Mr. De Haro: Thank you, Pierre‑Olivier. Before we open the floor to your questions, some ground rules. If you have a question, please raise your hand and wait until I call you. If I do, please identify yourself and the outlet you represent. We will be taking questions also online and via WebEx. I want to remind everyone that we are here to discuss the World Economic Outlook. If you have questions regarding country programs, negotiations, there is going to be plenty of regional press briefings later on in the week where you can tackle these issues. We are going to start here on the second row.

Question: David Lawder with Reuters News Service here in Washington. Pierre‑Olivier, can you go a little bit deeper into the scarring that is happening with low‑income developing economies? You said many of these are having a hard time sort of recovering after the various crises that they have been through. How is this being manifested? Which countries are having the worst time of it? Also, if you could comment a bit on the energy price outlook. The United States is looking at potentially new sanctions against Iran after its attack on Israel. That is likely to come in the oil sector. If we do see spikes in prices, what does that mean for inflation globally and the recovery? Thank you.

Mr. Gourinchas: Thanks, David. Yes, as I mentioned, estimates of scarring, which is the amount of decline in output relative to our pre‑pandemic, say January 2020 estimates, have been reduced for most regions and countries, but they have been increased for low‑income developing countries. Another thing we have noticed over the recent estimates and recent run of projections is also inflation and price pressures have been revised up, so what we are seeing for that region is a combination of still impacts in terms of output and also prices that remain quite strong, price pressures that remain quite strong.

What is going on here is we are seeing a combination of the effect of relatively high energy and food prices, increased food insecurity in countries in the region that is affecting outcomes. This is a region that is also—had limited—more limited fiscal buffers during the pandemic and the cost‑of‑living crisis to protect its population, and we see the remaining effect of this going on. We are in an environment in which interest rates are rising. There are fiscal pressures and so there is limited space for a lot of these countries to address this among low‑income and developing economies.

Now, in terms of potential output for energy price and what it might do to the global economy, this is something that we explored in our report. We looked at a scenario where we would have more geopolitical tensions that would result in elevated oil prices and energy prices and shipping costs. And what we find is that this would lead to higher price pressures in the global economy that would be higher inflation, there would be lower output. And roughly the estimates we have for a sustained increase in oil prices by about 15 percent would be an increase in inflation globally of about 0.7 percent. So there is some effect there. We are not in that scenario right now. Our assessment of what has been happened with the tensions in the Middle East is there has been some increase in oil prices, but it is too early to say whether that would be sustained, and it is not in our baseline, but we certainly looked at the scenario very carefully.

Mr. De Haro: Let us go there.

Question: Hello. This is Noor with Bloomberg Asharq. We have a question now. You touched upon the rising inflation again. So interest rates are already really high. How do you see central banks dealing with this, specifically the Fed, especially that now the probability of any decrease in interest rates in June is basically declining?

Mr. Gourinchas: This is one of the divergences we highlight in our report. We are saying that indeed the drivers of the inflation in countries like the United States are somewhat different than they are in other regions in the world, especially if you look at the Euro Area or the U.K. or Japan. There is evidence, which we document in our report, that tight labor markets, strong demand are playing a role in the U.S. And if that were to be reinforced, then the recent inflation print numbers in the U.S. seem to point in that direction, although we have to take that with a grain of salt. There is a lot of volatility in the month‑to‑month inflation numbers. Then I would probably call for a delayed easing of monetary policy in the U.S.

At the same time, I want to say that we would still expect the U.S. to be in a position where it starts easing sometime in 2024. The progress has been enormous in terms of disinflation and the resilience of the economy. What we are seeing now is maybe a slight adjustment in terms of the baseline.

Mr. De Haro: OK. We are going to go here in the first row and then we will go back.

Question: Yes. Thank you very much for the opportunity. So, China’s Q1 GDP number just came in at 5.3 percent, which was just released last night. So, how does that number look to you and given all‑year target, 5 percent, in the setback in the China government, so does that first quarter GDP number give you more confidence that we can reach the—hit the target for the whole year?

Also, in your remarks, you mentioned that China’s domestic demand will remain lackluster for quite some time. So strong measures and reforms just the root cause, so can you elaborate? What do you mean by the strong measures and the reforms? Thank you very much.

Mr. De Haro: Before we answer the question, we also have a question on WebEx on China, please, the reporter that wants to come in on WebEx. Weier.

Question: This is question from ETIME Media Group. In the context of the green transition, how should global cooperation be instructed and what role can China play in this collaborative effort? Additionally, at the last WEO release, you noted that globalization is plateauing. Have there been any changes in this trend and what impact might this have on global cooperation to address the climate change? Thank you.

Mr. De Haro: So, we can go with the GDP numbers and then we can go with the climate one.

Mr. Gourinchas: Yes, happy to. First, yes, last night, it was released that China’s GDP year‑on‑year for the first quarter was 5.3 percent. This is higher than the estimates. This is certainly higher also than the estimates we had here at the Fund. So the team will be assessing how they are revising their growth projections for the annual numbers, and it might be revised upwards. But I would like to emphasize some of the—some of the structural forces that are driving the Chinese economy right now. And certainly one of the important ones is the weakness in the property sector. And in our forecast for this year, our forecast was unchanged from January at 4.6 percent. There were two balancing forces. One was stronger stimulus that was coming from the Chinese government with measures that were announced as recently last month, in March, but then the continued weakness in the property sector and the two in our assessment were balancing each other out and leading to an unchanged forecast. Now we will have to see whether that is revised.

But the underlying weakness in the property sector is still there, and some of the indicators that we have and that were released even in the last few days do seem to point out that that weakness will persist. So when we are referring to reform measures that would be needed, those would be measures that would directly address some of the root cause in the weakness in the property sector, and that includes dealing with property developers that are struggling right now and recapitalizing or winding them down, then finding ways in which also there might be ways to sustain domestic consumption for China in the medium to long term, and that includes maybe building stronger safety nets.

The broader context here, and that allows me to answer the second question on China, is that with an economy that has potentially still relatively weak domestic demand but is growing, then there would be an increased reliance on the export sector. And that is something that in the context of very tight trade tensions could be complicated. So certainly that would be in the interest of the Chinese economy to develop ways of sustaining domestic demand. Let me turn to Daniel to see if there are any other points on China.

Mr. Leigh: I would just add that the green transition and the high-tech sectors present a great opportunity for China and policies like evening the playing field between state‑owned and private enterprises are going to help China capitalized on this great potential.

Mr. De Haro: OK. We are going to the third row. It is the third row. Yes, there.

Question: Larry Elliott of the Guardian. I just wonder whether you could say a bit more about the tensions in the Middle East. The world economy has been hit by a number of shocks in recent years, including the war in Ukraine. Is there a risk that the conflict between Israel and Iran could be the next [malign] in the global economy? Maybe you could unpack a bit more how you think it would impact on the global economy, not just through oil prices, but through business and consumer confidence.

Mr. Gourinchas: Yes. Certainly we watch the developments happening in that space, and we try to adjust our scenarios and our analysis based on that, so as I mentioned earlier, the way we approach this is by evaluating different possible trajectories for the global economy. The one that we describe in detail in our report is one where you would have fairly significant disruptions in oil markets that will lead to a 15 percent increase in oil prices and also an increase in shipping costs.

So, of course, one could think about more adverse scenarios than that, but I think that is something that we have not really contemplated just yet. The impact, to unpack a little bit the channels here, you are right, there would be an impact on business confidence. There would be an impact on investment, probably.

The increased inflation that would come from higher energy prices would trigger a response from central banks that would tighten interest rates in order to secure inflation coming back to target, and that would weigh down on activity, and that would do so in the context in which in some countries activity in growth is already fairly weak, and so that might also have a strong effect there.

Mr. De Haro: OK. First row there.

Question: Thank you very much. Joel Hills from ITV News. I wanted to pick up, Pierre‑Olivier, on some of the comments you were making about prioritization of rebuilding buffers, consolidation you say is never easy, but it is important that it is early gradual and credible. Sort of within that context, are you comfortable with the British approach of cutting taxes on an assumption, I suppose of future unspecified cuts to public spending?

Mr. De Haro: There is another question online from Holly Williams, Press Association, that says was it responsible for the U.K. chancellor to cut taxes in the latest budget when inflation is still above target, and it risks putting more pressure on price rises?

Mr. Gourinchas: What we emphasize in our report is a number of countries need to do—many of the countries in the world that have deployed fiscal buffers during the pandemic and the cost‑of‑living crisis have seen their debt‑to‑GDP increase substantially. Now, some of that has come down a little bit. This is the effect of unexpected inflation, if you want, but if you look at the trajectory, it is starting to grow again in many countries. And so we are calling for rebuilding these buffers, which is absolutely necessary to be able to deal with the kind of shocks that might be larger in magnitude and might be the—there might be more than one and the same time. We seem to be living in this shock‑prone world. Having that fiscal capacity is important. That is true for the U.K., but that is true for many other countries. That is true for many—chiefly this is true for the United States, this is true for many European economies, this is true for many countries around the world. So this is a general assessment that it is very important to do that. We see very clearly that those country that had the fiscal room to protect households and businesses during these two crises were able to do much better and were able to rebound much more quickly. So it is a time now that these crises are behind us, at least both of these crises are behind us, but we could be facing future crises and they could be coming to be prepared.

Mr. De Haro: We will take a question from WebEx and then go back to the room. Be patient. We will take more questions do not worry.

We have a question from Siram. Please go ahead. Hello. Can you here us?

Question: You projected a 6.8 percent and 6.5 percent growth rate for India over the last 2 years. Could you please elaborate on your policy recommendations for India? Specifically, could you comment on the employment situation there and other pressures to these growth numbers, such as net financial assets for those and private consumption which has been impacted by food inflation for many? Thank you.

Mr. De Haro: We have another question, similar question on India from the Economic Times on the press center that says, you have raised India’s growth forecast for 2024. What are the upsides and downside risks to this 6.8 percent number? How will the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East affect growth and inflation forecasts?

Mr. Gourinchas: Yes, thank you. Indeed, India is one of the strong performers. We had a fairly sharp revision in the Fiscal Year 2023 to 2024, the one that is ending, and that has just ended. Then we have 0.3 percentage point upgrade for Fiscal Year 2024 to 2025. So India is doing quite well. Let me turn to Daniel to answer more specifically.

Mr. Leigh: [No audio]. Moderation partly reflects the tightening in monetary policy and the tightening in fiscal policy, which is necessary to bring inflation down. We see inflation coming down — is in the target range 4.6 this year, 4.2 next year. There are upside risks to this forecast. They could be further strengthened in private demand.

Also, an upside comes from the potential for reforms that would liberalize foreign investment and really boost exports and boost jobs and labor force participation. So it’s a very strong outlook, and there’s a balanced risk outlook.

Mr. De Haro: Do we have any questions? We are going to the second row.

Question: Hi. I am Daniel Avis, AFP. Just a quick question about Russia, if I may. Can you help us just to understand what is behind the very significant increase not only now but over the last few months to the IMF’s forecast for Russia? Thank you.

Mr. De Haro: And I think we have another question on question on WebEx. Please come in. We cannot hear you.

Question: Good morning. Anton with TASS Agency of Russia. Thank you so much for doing this. The same question.

The growth rate of the Russian economy is high into 2024, then similar figures on the Group of Seven countries that imposed sanctions against Russia. In this case, can we say that Russia was able to successfully overcome the sanctions restrictions? Thank you so much.

Mr. De Haro: Yes.

Mr. Gourinchas: Yes. So we have revised Russia’s GDP growth in 2024 by 0.6 percentage points, to 3.2 percent, so this is a significant upward revision. We are still expecting growth to decline in 2025, from 3.2 percent to 1.8 percent.

I will turn to my colleague Petya Koeva Brooks to provide additional details.

Ms. Koeva Brooks: Thank you. So there are several factors behind the resilience of the Russian economy and the upgrades that we have made. I would mention four factors.

First, oil export volumes have held steady. The second part is that we have seen a lot of strength in corporate investment, including by state‑owned enterprises. The third is that we have also seen a lot of robustness in private consumption that has underpinned growth. And last, but not least, we have also had the impact from government spending; though there, we have seen much larger increases in security‑related spending than overall spending.

Now to put this in context, though, if we look into the medium term, there, we still have growth rates that are significantly below what they were prior to the war. Now we have growth rates in the order of one and a quarter, as opposed to 1.7, which we had previously, which is another way of saying that the Russian economy is still expected to face these headwinds as a result of the—again, the impact of the war and the associated sanctions. Thanks.

Mr. De Haro: We are going to go to the fourth row. Yep.

Question: Thank you. Susan Lynch from Politico. I have a question about the growth figures for Europe, the German economy, in particular, only going growing by 0.2 percent. What’s your analysis of that? And how concerned are you about the eurozone economy, in particular, particularly in comparison to the U.S.?

Mr. Gourinchas: So on the the euro economy, we have a region that has been feeling the full brunt of the energy crisis of the last 2022 and part of 2023 and is gradually emerging from that in the context of tight monetary policy. And so what we are seeing is a pickup in activity from 2023 to 2024. So growth in Germany, for instance, is very modest, 0.2 percent, but it’s higher than the negative growth in 2023. And the same is true at the level of the euro area, where we expect growth to grow from 0.4 percent in ‘23 to 0.8 percent in ‘24. And then as we go into 2025, we expect that monetary policy will start easing. So financial conditions will become easier, and also that the cost of living receding the purchasing power of households and workers will increase as real wages catch up. And that will also sustain demand. But we start from a position of relatively weak consumer sentiment, still tight monetary policy, and that’s still weighing down on growth in this year. Let me turn to Petya for additional comments on Germany and Europe.

Ms. Koeva Brooks: I don’t have much to add on Germany. For the euro area, some of the same factors are playing a role, although we do have quite a lot of heterogeneity within the euro area. So we do have upward revisions in other countries—for instance, Spain, Portugal, Belgium—that partially offset the downward revisions in Germany and France.

Mr. De Haro: We go to the first row here, and then we will move to this side.

Question: Thank you. Two questions on Argentina. You foresee a sharp decline in inflation and a rebound of GDP. I was hoping, if you could elaborate, if you see the disinflation process on solid footing, first.

Second, there’s a debate among economies, whether the recovery is going to be in L, V, or U shape. I was hoping you could pick a letter and tell us how and when the recovery, you see it happening. Thanks.

Mr. Gourinchas: So, on Argentina, I mean, the authorities are implementing a very ambitious stabilization plan to restore macroeconomic stability. And as you know, the plan is centered on a strong fiscal anchor that eliminates, in particular, any central bank financing of the government, which was one of the factors that was leading to very elevated inflation numbers under—in previous years. And so that is already showing its effects. We see this sharp decline in month‑on‑month inflation.

So the progress so far has been really impressive. The authorities have been able to record a fiscal surplus for the first time in over a decade. But, of course, this is going to take some time, and that’s going to require steadfast policy implementation. Much more needs to be done, and much more needs to be done on the broader scale. So I think this is—we are watching this situation closely. Our teams here at the Fund are in close contact with the authorities. But the progress, again, has been quite sharp. Now, whether that’s going to be a V, U, or L, let’s agree that we’d much prefer V over U over L.

Mr. De Haro: And with the alphabet, we are going to move toward this side of the room, the lady that —thank you.

Question: Hello. Ana Rodriguez. El Tiempo, Colombian Newspaper. In general, what the growth perspective for Latin America, not only for Argentina? And across the world, what is the—how do you see the oil markets in that region, please? Thank you.

Mr. De Haro: Before we answer, there are two specific questions about the outlook on Mexico and Brazil. So if we could elaborate, too, that would be great.

Mr. Gourinchas: So let me just give a few numbers and then turn it over to Petya.

The Latin American and Caribbean region, we see growth that has been—is going to slow down a little bit, from 2.7 percent to 2.5 percent. The numbers I give you here are excluding Argentina and Venezuela, which have fairly specific environments. And that is revised up in 2024 by 0.2 percentage points. So there is a lot of resilience in the region, as well; although, of course, a number of countries in the region have tight monetary policy—in fact, tight monetary policy that started ahead of what advanced economies did. And that is weighing down on growth and is expected to go away as we have some easing of monetary conditions. Petya.

Ms. Koeva Brooks: Maybe a few words on Mexico and Brazil. Starting with Brazil, we are expecting growth to come down from 2.9 in ‘23 to 2.2 this year, and then to stay about the same at about the same rate, 2.1, in 2025.

Now, last year, we saw a lot of strength due to record agricultural production. And this time around, we see moderation in that, as well as the—

We also have an upgrade in our forecast for this year as a result of the fiscal support, which is expected to be seen in the country.

Now, when it comes to Mexico, we are expecting growth to come down to 2.4 this year, from 3.2 last year, and then going onto 2025 to be a 1.4. We have seen a strong recovery in the second half of 2023 due to a lot of internal demand, especially investment. And, of course, the strength of the U.S. economy and the close links of Mexico with that have also played a role. I will stop here. Thanks.

Mr. De Haro: OK. We have 10 minutes. I am going to come back here. I know that you’ve been waiting very patiently. Let’s go to that side of the room, Bloomberg, and then we will end up here. I hope that we still have two, three questions left. So don’t worry.

Question: Thank you, Pierre‑Olivier. Eric Martin with Bloomberg News.

I wanted to ask you about your commentary on the U.S. fiscal situation and the fiscal balance. In the report, it mentions larger‑than‑expected government spending, including what’s estimated — or comparison, excuse me, with prior WEO forecasts, 2 percent of GDP in the U.S. Can you talk a little bit about the conversations between the IMF and the U.S. in terms of what the U.S. should be pursuing in terms of fiscal policy and given the size of the U.S. economy—about a quarter of the world economy—how concerning this is for overheating around the world?

Mr. Gourinchas: Yes. So there is, of course, the cyclical part, and there’s a more structural part. So let me start with the cyclical part. Here, what I would want to emphasize is the U.S. is expected to turn toward fiscal consolidation in 2024. In our projections, there is a 1.9 percent increase in the structural fiscal balance of the U.S. for 2024. And that is one of the reasons, among others, why we are expecting also growth to slow down in this year compared to last year and after that. So there is some movement in the right direction, if you want.

But as for many other countries, we are concerned that this is, A, not enough and, B, more importantly, not necessarily sustained over a sufficient period of time, that it would bring back debt‑to‑GDP levels into a more comfortable zone.

And the background here is that, even if we have an easing of monetary policy that is expected—our baseline is still that the Fed is going to cut policy rates sometime later this year—the funding costs for government debt may not be decreasing as much because of what is called the term premium, the risk premium on government debt has increased in recent times and may remain high in the context that debt levels are elevated and there are risks around that. So we are concerned that more of that medium‑term implication of the fiscal trajectory for the U.S. Daniel, anything to add?

Mr. De Haro: Third row there. Nope. I will take both questions. You are first.

Question: My name is Ivan. I work for AFP and the Africa Report. I have one question. This is going to be a very interesting year for Africa, especially about close to 19 countries are going for general elections. I want to know your projections, considering the fact that this usually comes with a lot of political violence in some areas, as well as sluggish growth that has affected the sub‑Saharan region. I want to know more about the recommendations you have for these African countries that are going for elections, especially in this period, and what you expect. Thank you.

Mr. De Haro: Yeah. Let’s go first with this question and then we can—

Mr. Gourinchas: I mean, 2024 is the biggest election year on record, and so the question of elections is important for many parts of the world, including Africa. And that is a concern especially in relation to what we just discussed, which is the fiscal trajectories that there is a risk there that there could be some fiscal slippage.

For the sub‑Saharan Africa region, our growth number for 2024 is 3.8 percent. This is actually unchanged from our January projection, and it’s up from 3.4 percent in 2023. So there is a rebound in growth and activity, as the supply side improves and maybe as the negative effects of past weather shocks subside.

Daniel, anything to add?

Mr. Leigh: After four years of quite—a lot of turmoil, this is the year where we really see a turnaround in investor appetite for Africa. We have had Côte d’Ivoire issuing the Eurobond, Benin, Kenya spreads easing. So this is going to ease some of the pressure on these economies. Also, as inflation starts to come down, inflation is coming down as those past shocks fade and also thanks to the tight policies that have been implemented. Of course, there’s a lot of risks around this scenario in the context of elections. There could be more spending in the short term that could provide a boost, but there are serious potential disruptions later on, if there’s an easing, as in other parts of the world, this is our assessment.

Also, there’s the upside risk from further acceleration of reforms to help people get jobs and attract more foreign investment.

Mr. De Haro: Allow me to remind you that there’s going to be regional press briefings going on later this week so we can continue tackling some of these issues. Go ahead and then we will have time for only one question, and we will have to end.

Question: OK. Thank you very much. My name is Hope Moses from Business Day Nigeria. You raised Nigeria’s growth from 2.9 percent to 3.3 percent, so what are the drivers of this growth, considering the fact that inflation is rising every day, and then the impact of fuel subsidies and other factors. Thank you.

Mr. Gourinchas: Thank you. I will ask Daniel.

Mr. Leigh: Yes. Growth in Nigeria, steady but actually rising this year, from 2.9 percent last year to 3.3 percent this year. We have seen an expansion from the recovery in the oil sector, with a better security situation and also improved agriculture, benefiting from the better weather conditions and the introduction of dry season farming. So there’s a broad‑based increase also in the financial sector, in the IT sector. Inflation, yes, it has increased. Part of this reflects the reforms, the exchange rate and its pass‑through into other goods from imports to other goods. So this explains also why we revised up our inflation projection for this year to 26 percent. But with the tight monetary policies and that interest rate increase, significant interest rate increases during February and March, we think—we see inflation declining to 23 percent next year and then 18 percent in 2026. So in the right direction, definitely.

Mr. De Haro: Last question is going to be the gentleman there. And I am sorry. There’s going to be more opportunities to ask more questions. There are regional press briefings happening later this week where you can tackle all the country‑specific questions.

Question: Hi. I am from Geo TV Pakistan. We all know climate change is a big problem. So how has the climate change impacted the growth and inflation in the last few years? Because in 2022, floods in Pakistan caused an estimated economic loss of around $30 billion. This is an estimate by the World Bank. And I also would like to know, what is the IMF doing to help these countries that are being damaged by the climate change?

Mr. Gourinchas: So we are seeing, in fact, increased weather shocks related to the climate transition, and that is impacting sometimes countries at a macroeconomic level. And the example of Pakistan I think is a relevant one here. But there are other countries that are, of course, in that situation. And often, what we have is that countries that are among the low‑income countries might be more vulnerable to these extreme weather events. So it’s a conjunction of having relatively little in terms of fiscal buffers or ability or infrastructure and the capacity to deal with these events and, therefore, they have a much larger impact on people’s well‑being and livelihoods. So that’s something that is factored into our rounds of projections. We do take into account the broad array of risks that countries are facing.

The second part of your question, what the Fund can do. I mean, the Fund, along with other organizations, is of course—international organizations, is very focused on climate issues. We have an instrument, the Resilience and Sustainability Trust, that is designed to help countries build that resilience going forward and help them be able to weather these types of shocks. We are also involved in providing technical assistance in helping countries both adapt and put in place mitigation strategies for climate change. Thanks.

Mr. De Haro: OK. So we are going to have to wrap it here but on behalf of Pierre‑Olivier, Petya, and Daniel, the Research Department, Communications Department, I want to thank you all. A couple of reminders, the next press briefing is the Global Financial Stability Report in this same room. Tomorrow, pay attention to the Fiscal Monitor and as I said, later this week, regional press briefings. You can tackle those country‑specific questions. And don’t forget also to come to the Managing Director’s press briefing. Thank you very much. Any comments, questions, media@IMF.org.","(4, 'national debt')"

The pandemic throttled many parts of the American economy, just as President Biden was taking office. Since then, jobless numbers have dropped and unemployment is below 4%. Yet, a recent poll conducted by The Economist and YouGov found that more than 50% of participants felt the economy was getting worse overall. And that's important because Americans often rank the economy as a top voting issue.

All Things Considered spoke with four ""American Indicators"" throughout the Biden presidency, four people in different parts of the country reflecting different parts of the economy. Now that it's an election year, they spoke with NPR again — this time, to talk about their own politics.

Travel

Bhavesh Patel is a franchise hotel owner — think brands like Comfort Inn and Hampton Inn — in the Northeast United States. When he first spoke with NPR in 2021, the country was beginning to emerge from the pandemic recession. At the time, he owned seven hotels in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Illinois. In the years since, he has had to downsize.

""We sold off three properties, so we're down to four now.""

He says his two sons, both in their 20s, are pursuing careers in medicine, instead of going into the family business — and Patel says he can't blame them.

""It's a tough market to be in right now."" Patel says. When he graduated from college in 1990, the hotel industry ""was a lucrative business. You didn't have all these rules, regulations, brand specs. But now, things have gotten tighter. It has gotten more complicated to run a hotel.""

Patel says right now, high-end hotels are doing much better than the midscale places he runs. The wealth gap has continued to grow over the last few years. Between those challenges and tighter regulations, he sometimes wonders whether he should have chosen a different career.

""I don't want the government telling me how to run my business,"" he says. ""I don't want all these different rules and stipulations out there and whatnot.""

Patel calls himself a moderate Republican. He voted for former President Donald Trump in 2016, then for President Biden in 2020. And he still hasn't decided who he's going to vote for this time around.

""We will see where the campaign goes and what's to come in the next couple of months.""

Housing

Lee Camp is a housing attorney in St. Louis. In his city, he says, rents keep increasing and the availability of housing is decreasing.

""I'm certainly not hearing anyone in the renter space, particularly the low-income renter space, excited about the direction of the economy,"" he says.

Things have improved since the summer of 2021, when he first spoke with NPR. At the time, his office's phones were being inundated with people asking for housing assistance, as a pandemic moratorium on evictions ended. In 2024, he says it's still a tumultuous time.

""What is extremely unfortunate at this point is that the eviction filings themselves are as high as I've ever seen them in my career.""

According to the Eviction Lab, which tracks eviction filings, there were 1,288 eviction filings in the past month, 124% of average filings for the same month before the pandemic.

""It certainly worries me that still our most vulnerable individuals — that's renters that are low-income individuals — are experiencing homelessness, that they're really still having a tough time and that systems like the courts and evictions are still dominating their narrative and their experience of the economy right now.""

Now, he is encouraged that more of his clients are working or finding new jobs than they were during the pandemic. But Camp points to high consumer prices as an ongoing worry.

""On the flip side, everything just seems more expensive for [my clients] as well,"" he says. ""And I certainly personally feel that too.""

Camp says he and his wife can afford the increase in cost of groceries, but they still feel the extra burden. And Camp says there's another thing on his mind when it comes to the economy.

""One thing that's been substantially changing is the resumption of student loan payments. I love my career. I love that I get to serve people and work alongside so many inspiring and amazing individuals. But the loan payments are back, and that has certainly changed our financial picture in our household.""

He adds, ""I would encourage [the Biden Administration] to go further, particularly if they get the option to do so in a second term.""

Food

When Brooke Neubauer, founder of the Just One Project, the largest distributor of groceries to at-risk individuals in Nevada, looks at the economy today, she says there are plenty of jobs, but ""what I'm hearing from my clients is that the wages have not caught up with the cost of living.""

Nevada has the second-highest grocery prices in the nation, behind California, with an average of nearly $300 spent on groceries per week.

""For our clients that are coming in, they're saving on average $250 to $300 a month with us, and they're able to get dairy and produce, meats and poultry and all the things that you and I would get at the store.""

Neubauer points to systemic issues that make it difficult for people to access food, like food deserts, grocery stores pulling out of lower-income neighborhoods and the closure of hundreds of Family Dollar locations across the country.

The Just One Project serves about 20,000 people a month. At the peak of the pandemic, the organization was serving about 58,000 people a month, nearly three times as many. And over the years, their organization has felt the rising cost of food, as she told NPR in 2023.

""Purchasing millions of pounds a year of food, our grocery bill has gone up tremendously, and for us, we purchase in such large quantities, it's hitting us pretty hard.""

When it comes to politics, she wants a president who will invest in social services, particularly for people like her clients.

""I'm not a fan of a president who is unkind,"" she says. ""And look, I spend my life's work trying to make the world a better place. I spend my time as a mom teaching my kids to be kind and inspiring them to be loving. I couldn't bear to vote for a presidential candidate that was not aligned with my values.""

Neubauer has voted for both Democrats and Republicans in the past, and she says she has an open mind when going to the polls. But she's decided on this election.

""I just can't fathom that Donald Trump is the best thing that we have come up with to run for president.""

Manufacturing

In Georgia, Lisa Winton, co-founder of Winton Machine Company, sees herself as a pocketbook voter – not just for herself, but for the 40 people her company employs.

""I have those 40 people to think about and I have their families to think about, and then I have my vendors to think about,"" she says. ""So it's hard not to think about those fiscal policies.""

Winton says last year, the economy looked good — her company had their best year by 20%, a banner year. As a result, she says her company had looked into opening a second factory, but her lease on her current space nearly doubled, and they had to put those plans on hold.

Winton considers herself ""fiscally conservative and socially liberal,"" which puts her in a frustrating spot.

""I am not a party voter. I vote for a candidate based on fiscal policies and also based on some social policies as well.""

Asked which candidate she thinks will get her vote, she answers, ""I am so torn. I don't know yet.""

""I'm not happy with the current administration,"" she says. ""I'm not happy with a lot of policies that have been enacted. But I'm also, on a social standpoint, not happy with some policies.""

Ultimately, Winton wants to see a moderate candidate in the White House, and she doesn't feel that either of the options in front of her fit that description.

""Like so many other voters, I feel like there has to be a better solution.""","(0, 'GDP')"

Addressing systemic racism is a moral imperative; it can also make economies stronger

George Floyd. Breonna Taylor. Ahmaud Arbery. Three Black Americans killed in acts that reminded the world that systemic racism is still very real in the United States. The early summer protests that followed, though sparked by those deaths, were manifestations of deeper anger and despair at the racism that has plagued the country since its founding.

As protests spread worldwide, many began to shift focus from solidarity with Black Americans to racial injustice within their own countries. Adama Traoré. João Pedro Matos Pinto. David Dungay, Jr. Different names from different countries, but still victims whose deaths have forced reexamination of the global presence of systemic racism and sent demonstrators into the streets to demand better.

Demanding an end to racism, and a remedy for its legacy, is not just morally correct but a boost to economic development. Continuing to deny the existence of racism, and refusing to confront it, will lead to a less vibrant, less cohesive, less prosperous world.

Birth of a nation

A multiracial nation since its independence, the United States has struggled to overcome what many refer to as its “original sin”—slavery—and the de jure and de facto racial discrimination that followed its abolition. Systemic racism continues to burden the United States, and Black Americans have borne the brunt of its legacy.

Racism in local American police departments is a deep-seated problem. According to analysis by the Washington Post and the Guardian, Black Americans are twice as likely as whites to be killed by police while unarmed. Although this is one of the most widely known forms of systemic racism, the problem runs much deeper.

For example, racism is rampant in medicine—in 2016, the US National Academy of Sciences found that 29 percent of white first-year American medical students thought that Black people’s blood coagulates more quickly than white people’s, and 21 percent believed that Black people have stronger immune systems. Such misunderstanding often leads to inadequate preventive care and inferior treatment, resulting in worse health outcomes for Blacks than whites across the board. One study published by the American Heart Association found that racist medical notions contributed to Black women in America being a third more likely to die of heart disease than white women.

Racism has restrained Black economic progress for decades. The benefits of the post–World War II GI Bill, which fueled the growth of the American middle class, were largely denied to Black people at the insistence of white members of Congress from the South desperate to enforce racial segregation—war heroes or not. “Redlining,” a Federal Housing Administration policy that refused to insure mortgages in Black neighborhoods, shut Black Americans out of one of the most common avenues for accumulating wealth, home ownership. These factors have all played a role in a persistent Black-white wealth gap. According to a 2019 McKinsey report, median Black families have 10 times less wealth than median white families.

Liberté, égalité, fraternité—pour qui?

Many other countries, such as France, experience similarly entrenched racism, even though that country’s national mythology purports it to be a steadfastly color-blind society. The government refuses to compile statistics on faith, ethnicity, or skin color in its census. This universalist outlook masks modern-day racism resulting from historical atrocities. As is true of many countries in Europe, France’s role in perpetuating colonial race-based slavery in the Americas is often misunderstood, leading to a belief that racism is a new-world, not an old-world, problem.

As Maboula Soumahoro, a specialist in African diaspora studies at the University of Tours, told France 24, “Because slavery was illegal on the mainland, people in France have the impression that this hyper-racialized history that is characteristic of the modern world only concerns the Americas,” adding that “France is not blind to racism. France thinks it’s blind to racism.” This refusal to see race, and the official policy that derives from it, leaves the country unprepared to address systemic racism.

Policing in France may be less lethal than in the United States, but violence and discrimination are targeted far more toward racial minorities than toward French people who are white. Young men perceived as Black or Arab are 20 times more likely to face identity checks. Twenty percent of young Black or Arab French people reported being the victim of brutality in their most recent police interaction—well above the 8 percent of their white counterparts.

As in the United States, however, this systemic racism extends far beyond treatment by police. In a country where religion is often strongly correlated with race, men perceived to be Muslim by employers are up to four times less likely to get a job interview than candidates seen as Christian, according to the think tank Institut Montaigne (Valfort 2015). A 2018 study by the University of Paris-Est Créteil found that job applicants with Arab-sounding names got 25 percent fewer responses than those with French-sounding names.

Racial—or racist—democracy?

Brazil’s views on racism are also deeply rooted in its national self-image. For many, the country is viewed as a “racial democracy”—which stems from the belief that Brazil transitioned directly from the 1888 abolition of slavery (the last country in the Western Hemisphere to do so) to participatory, multiracial democracy, avoiding the discrimination enshrined in law in countries like the United States and South Africa. In the minds of many Brazilians, racism and discrimination don’t exist in Brazil—after all, Brazil never passed laws like Jim Crow segregation or apartheid, so how could it be truly racist?

Yet in a country where people of partial or full African descent are in the majority, Blacks in Brazil lag far behind whites in major quality of life indicators. Black Brazilians fare far worse in educational attainment. For example, in 2012 fewer than 13 percent of Afro-Brazilians over the age of 16 had received postsecondary education, 15 points lower than whites (Pereira 2016).

Some would ascribe this to class differences, not race; however, one study found that among sets of Brazilian twins in the same household where one was labeled white and the other nonwhite, the nonwhite twin was at a distinct disadvantage in educational attainment, particularly if the twin was male (Marteleto and Dondero 2016).

Black Brazilians also bear the brunt of violence at the hands of law enforcement. In 2018, the police killed 6,220 people in Brazil, and despite representing about half of the national population, 75 percent of those killed were Black (Sakamoto 2019).

These systemic factors have widespread socioeconomic consequences. A study by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics found in 2019 that the average income for white workers was 74 percent higher than for Black and brown workers—a gap that has remained stable for years. Even with the same level of education, Afro-Brazilian men made only 70 percent of comparable white men’s income, and Afro-Brazilian women only 41 percent.

Economic costs

Systemic racism is a global problem. It is real, and there is a robust moral argument for addressing it. However, one factor that is often ignored in this critical conversation is the broader economic dimension. Because it prevents people from making the most of their economic potential, systemic racism carries significant economic costs. A less racist society can be an economically stronger one.

For instance, the wealth gap between American whites and Blacks is projected to cost the US economy between $1 trillion and $1.5 trillion in lost consumption and investment between 2019 and 2028. This translates to a projected GDP penalty of 4 to 6 percent in 2028 (Noel and others 2019).

Or think of France, where GDP could jump 1.5 percent over the next 20 years—an economic bonus of $3.6 billion—by reducing racial gaps in access to employment, work hours, and education (Bon-Maury and others 2016). Witness also Brazil, which is losing out on vast sums of potential consumption and investment because of its marginalized communities.

A worldwide scourge

Of course, these three countries are not the only ones to experience racism, its deleterious social and economic effects, and the need for broader acknowledgment of its existence.

For instance, in a poll of Australians taken in the wake of the George Floyd protests, 78 percent of respondents said that US authorities have been unwilling to address racism. Only 30 percent believed there was institutional racism in Australian police forces. This view conflicts with both the lived experience of indigenous Australians in particular and with the A$44.9 billion the Alfred Deakin Institute believes racism cost Australia between 2001 and 2011.

Meanwhile, various racist incidents in China against African immigrants jeopardize the lucrative Sino-African trade and investment relationship. According to Yaqiu Wang, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, this is another case of discrimination denial, “where Chinese authorities claim ‘zero tolerance’ for discrimination, but what they are doing to Africans in Guangzhou is a textbook case of just that.”

Countries should not try to address racism simply because it will help their economic development. It is a debt owed to their own citizens. However, the world should understand that commitment to respecting human rights and racial equity shouldn’t be a passive statement of values. It should be a call to action, backed by active measures to acknowledge, understand, measure, and eradicate systemic racism. The world is at an inflection point, and it is up to our policymakers to meet the moment. If not, racism will continue to cost us all.","(1, 'employment/wages')"

Welcome to the January 2023 edition of NC Economy Watch: an update on what’s happening in the North Carolina economy and what it means for you, brought to you by the Labor & Economic Analysis Division (LEAD) of the NC Department of Commerce.

In this edition, we provide an update on hiring challenges in our state. The labor market has eased slightly in recent months, but hiring conditions remain historically tight, and demographic trends suggest labor shortages may become a routine feature of life during future periods of economic growth.

The Labor Market Is Loosening, but It’s Still Very Tight

One of the most important trends in North Carolina’s economy the past several years has been our tightening labor market. A shortage of workers and an excessive level of job vacancies has generated increased opportunities for jobseekers but also led to challenges for employers struggling to fill open positions, headaches for customers trying to obtain scarce goods and services, and upward pressure on prices.

After a torrid pace of growth in 2021, the economy slowed during 2022 as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to get a handle on rising prices. As a result, North Carolina’s labor market has softened somewhat. However, hiring conditions remain historically tight.

Data from LEAD’s Labor Supply and Demand dashboard demonstrate the impact of slowing economic growth on our labor market. A decline in the number of job openings in North Carolina has led to a marginal easing in labor market conditions: we had 1.0 jobseeker per job opening in October 2022, rising from a low of 0.9 in July [Figure 1]. But conditions are still much tighter than they were in February 2020—when we had 1.6 jobseekers per job opening—and remain tighter than they’ve been in at least two decades.1

Figure 1

We find similar evidence of slight improvements along with continued hiring challenges in surveys of employers. Figures from the Richmond Fed’s Carolinas Survey of Business Activity indicate companies in our region are having somewhat better luck recruiting qualified talent as of late, but hiring remains as difficult as ever [Figure 2].

Figure 2

Our office is often asked: what’s up with labor force participation, and what impact does it have on our state’s hiring challenges? North Carolina’s labor force participation rate fell during the COVID-19 recession and remained below its pre-pandemic level in 2022. But contrary to popular belief, the current shortfall in labor force participation is not primarily caused by health concerns, or childcare problems, or the “Great Resignation”, or any other consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. While these factors may have driven participation rates lower during 2020 and 2021, the most important factor right now is simple, old-fashioned demographics: our population is getting older. Older people are more likely to retire. The aging of our population explains most of the shortfall in North Carolina’s labor force participation rate between 2019 and 2022 [Figure 3].

Figure 3

The labor market has indeed softened in recent months, but the Federal Reserve has made clear the economy needs to slow even more before price inflation can be brought under control. Moving forward, a slowing economy and the prospect of a potential recession will likely bring further weakening in labor market conditions: the number of job openings will decrease, and the unemployment rate will rise. Employers tend to have an easier time filling open positions, and jobseekers tend to have a harder time finding work, during economic downturns.

But that doesn’t necessarily mean the era of tight labor markets is behind us. The aging of our population means labor shortages could outlast the current economic moment. Hiring challenges aren’t simply an artifact of the COVID-19 pandemic or its economic aftershocks. As population growth slows and labor force participation declines, barring a major shift in technological or demographic trends, labor shortages may become a routine feature of life during future periods of economic growth.

Eliminating the entry barriers faced by women in STEM careers would significantly boost the country’s productivity growth

Japan has one of the oldest populations globally, with its working-age population shrinking since the late 1990s. Despite that, Japan achieved impressive per capita gross domestic product growth, trailing only the United States, from 2012 to 2019 during “Abenomics”—the combination of monetary stimulus, fiscal flexibility, and structural reform advocated by Prime Minister Shinzō Abe.

A major contributor to per capita growth was the rising number of women entering the labor force. The female labor-force participation rate in Japan rose to 74 percent in 2022 from 63 percent in 2012. The new entrants, typically former stay-at-home mothers, were able to rejoin the labor force thanks to enhanced child-care support from the government and improved maternity-leave policies. These additional female workers helped mitigate the country’s chronic labor shortage, boosted family income, and fueled the growth engine.

However, the upward trend of women’s labor-force participation rate is now slowing and will likely plateau soon. Japan is in search of a new growth engine.

One oft-suggested solution is to bring in more talent from overseas. Compared with other Group of Seven countries, Japan has the lowest number of foreign workers, accounting for only 2.8 percent of the workforce. The government is implementing policies to attract more skilled workers from abroad but is unlikely to reach the scale that would offset the population decline under the current political environment.

To raise output without more workers, Japan must boost the labor productivity of its existing workforce. Our previous analysis of this situation promotes automation and digitalization, but both require STEM, or science, technology, engineering and math, talent that is in short supply in Japan.

Our recent research suggests that women in Japan could, again, be the growth engine. Rather than supplying cheap labor, more women should be encouraged to pursue careers in STEM fields. In Japan, only 7 percent of female university students major in STEM, compared with 36 percent of male students; that’s also less than comparable countries.

Such under-representation reflects various barriers in Japan that exist for women in STEM fields, rather than a lack of female talent. Eliminating those barriers will increase the supply of STEM talent, providing more Japanese workers who are instrumental for automation, digitalization, and innovation.

Using a model with STEM talent as the engine for economic growth, our research shows that eliminating the barriers faced by women in such jobs could accelerate productivity growth by 20 percent in Japan. The permanent productivity gains mainly reflect an increase in the number of STEM workers, who will innovate and push the technology frontier. With productivity growing at a faster pace, output and wages will also increase faster, leading to higher consumption and welfare.

Although beneficial to the economy as a whole, bridging the gender gap creates winners and losers. Female STEM workers would benefit the most, as, in theory, their income would converge with their male counterparts’, conditional on their talent. All non-STEM workers would also benefit from faster productivity growth.

On the other hand, male STEM workers could receive lower wages as the total supply of those workers increases. The least talented male STEM workers could even be replaced by female ones. The average welfare of all Japanese workers would rise by about 4 percent, based on our model calculation.

Women worldwide face both explicit and implicit pay gaps in STEM fields. Explicit pay gaps can be directly observed in earnings data, all other factors being equal. Such barriers are easier to identify and target with policies. At the same time, women also face implicit pay gaps due to disproportionate family burdens and workplace discrimination.

Women disproportionately step back from their careers when they have care-giving responsibilities, as Harvard University’s Claudia Goldin, this year’s Nobel laureate for economic sciences, documented in her 2021 book, Career and Family: Women’s Century-Long Journey toward Equity. That reality is responsible in large part for their diverging career paths and earnings gap.

The Japanese government is making progress in reducing the explicit pay gap. Recent “framework policies” that require companies to increase the transparency of data about their gender wage gaps are a welcome step. Such disclosure can help the government enforce its “equal pay for equal work” regulation and narrow the gender pay gap.

But more needs to be done to eliminate the implicit pay gap in Japan. Work-style reforms and a more flexible labor market are both essential. Labor-market changes in hiring and promotion based on merit, instead of seniority, would improve the returns on STEM education for women.

While eliminating barriers for women in STEM may take years, if not decades, to implement, Japan’s policymakers can explore the use of quotas and other policies to correct for gender biases, including in STEM fields.

Over time, more talented women will be encouraged to join STEM fields once they can observe other women with successful careers in those occupations. When this happens, women with STEM training will innovate and contribute more to Japan’s economic prosperity.
